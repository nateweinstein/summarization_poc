So it started in the 80s with the advent of stock options, and the original motivation for it was actually very smart in that when you\u2019re talking about software engineering, yes you can build a product to do something, but how you build it matters even more than what the actual functionality is at the end, and to get kind of to a level where people are really invested in what they\u2019re building, it made sense to make the people building that software be owners in the company.

Wait a minute, if you\u2019re rich and you have 90 days to exercise, that\u2019s fine because you can buy your stock options, but if you\u2019re not rich, then you can\u2019t, and so now we\u2019ve created this class thing.

Then there are a couple of knock-on effects, one is that the stock in your company in the old model, when somebody would leave, would typically basically come back into the pool, and that just meant the overall dilution over a long period of time would be lower, which affects all owners and employees.

One, which Ben mentioned of course, that certainly early employees, rightly so, get more stock because obviously they\u2019re taking on higher risk. The other thing that the early employees typically have available to them is what\u2019s called 83B, which allows them to essentially early exercise their options when the strike price is still very low and therefore the cash out of pocket required to do so is relatively minimal, and they also don\u2019t have a tax event at that point in time. So what often happens for early employees is they eliminate this 90-day exit window issue because they\u2019ve already early exercised their stock at a point where the stock price was cheap enough that it was financially viable for most people to do so. So that issue has always existed; we\u2019ve always had this early versus later employee issue if nothing else then in the form of this 83B."}, "67": {"index": 35, "author": "Scott Kupor", "title": "a16z Podcast: Beyond One Size Fits All for Startup Employee Options | Andreessen Horowitz", "description": "Do we need a new pay system for the way startup employees are compensated?\u00c2\u00a0While many people agree that the current 90-day exercise practice \u2014 an outdated \u2026", "content": " The other that I think is also interesting is Tesla, which goes less to vesting but more towards how you think about sizing option grants based on seniority and tenure of employees, and one of the things that Tesla does is instead of the typical practice which is most people a very significant grant the day they join the company and then over time they might get some refresher grants, but those refresher grants are often a fraction of what their initial grant was."}, "68": {"index": 36, "author": "Scott Kupor", "title": "a16z Podcast: Beyond One Size Fits All for Startup Employee Options | Andreessen Horowitz", "description": "Do we need a new pay system for the way startup employees are compensated?\u00c2\u00a0While many people agree that the current 90-day exercise practice \u2014 an outdated \u2026", "content": " You could do that, but it\u2019s just not as valuable, is the honest answer.

The reason it\u2019s relevant in this context is one of the things that Eric does talk about is aligning incentives between investors and managers of the company, and one of the ways he proposes to do that is to have longer vesting periods, to have compensation programs that are much more tied toward long-term goals for the company as opposed to things today that are tied to relatively short-term goals like what quarterly results look like. And in return obviously he\u2019s expecting investors also to take a longer-term view towards managing the company.

So I had to figure out how to meet people. And it was on the internet, a lot of Twitter writing. And then I guess there\u2019s a period of time, maybe four years ago, some of the popular meme and parody accounts had started. I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s ghostwriting, but you get to know them and you give them some ideas. And my ideas did really well. So, I was like, \u201cWhy don\u2019t I just start making memes?\u201d Like, people love it. And I think it\u2019s just a way to show a little bit more authenticity. I think that\u2019s kind of the secret to storytelling is you want people to be entertained and you want to have it be as authentic to you as possible, to make it really easy to scale. Based in LA, everyone knows about creators, all that kind of stuff. But I think burnout is real in any creative artistic pursuit. So, if you do something that\u2019s very authentic to who you are, it\u2019s just a little bit easier to kind of scale it and keep it going. And for me, I\u2019m a serious person, but I don\u2019t take myself very seriously. So, memes just kind of slotted in pretty easily. And when it comes to taking it too far, memes specifically, for me, the strategy is, you just kind of poke fun at higher-level things, you never put down any one individual or person, it\u2019s always a class. And I think VCs, it\u2019s very easy to make fun of VCs. And I am one. So, I think some of us are very self-aware and some of us aren\u2019t, but it\u2019s entertaining content. So, the intersection of all those things, just, it kind of snowballed over time.

Now, interestingly, not everybody is as active on Twitter announcing all these things, but there are so many people\u2026 I mean, it\u2019s incredible how many people are here.

It\u2019s around aerospace, it\u2019s around building these brand-new industries. And guess where the headquarters of all that is? It\u2019s here, right? I mean, in SoCal. And I think that is a huge part. There are very serious engineers and folks that are coming out of the top schools in this area. I think the kinds of companies that are being built are actually very diverse. There\u2019s a reason why this is a major effort around crypto also in the city is for all of those reasons.
