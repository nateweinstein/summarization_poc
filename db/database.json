(Our pod <a href=\"https://a16z.com/2019/12/07/what-you-do-is-who-you-are-tech-culture-change-code-story/\">The Stories &amp; Code of Culture Change</a> discusses Ben\u2019s most recent book.)</p>\n<p>During the conversation, Reed tells the story of Netflix\u2019s evolution and his management philosophy, including the hard lesson he learned about what happens when you optimize for efficiency at the expense of creative talent. He also explains why sometimes a more narrow market focus is better for growth and shares the tactics that have helped Netflix expand globally and translate a culture of innovation across different countries, from Japan to Brazil to America.</p>\n<h1><div class=\"toc-mobile-wrapper\"><h4>TABLE OF CONTENTS</h4><ul class=\"toc-list\"></ul></div>Transcript</h1>\n<p><strong>Ben:</strong> One of the reasons I really liked your book is you start from that honest place of \u00e2\u0080\u009cI screwed it up and now I need to figure it out.\u00e2\u0080\u009d You did that at your prior company Pure Software, which needed to reinvent itself, but couldn\u2019t. What were the things that you ran into at Pure that kept you from being able to reinvent?</p>\n<p><strong>Reed:</strong> I was a first-time manager. I had invented the first product Purify, which was a C debugging tool. I was an inexperienced CEO, and that manifested itself in several ways. One, in particular, was every time something went wrong, I didn\u2019t want that to go wrong again, which is typically how an engineer approaches a problem. If you find an error in software, you try to build a regression suite or test for it that runs to make sure that error doesn\u2019t come back, and that\u2019s good design and good engineering.</p>\n<p>I viewed the organization as a big software puzzle, which I know is laughably simplistic, but that\u2019s how I viewed it. And so, every time there was an error, we\u2019d put a process in place to make sure that error didn\u2019t happen. And, indeed, generally that particular error didn\u2019t happen. But what I missed were the cultural effects of that year after year. And the cultural effect was that the people who prospered were the people who could develop and follow process well. That was the value system. If you followed the process well, you were rewarded in all kinds of ways. Over time it slowly drove out the creative mavericks who didn\u2019t really want to deal with all that crap. The subtle thing is in the short term the business ran better, not worse, because it was very highly optimized. There was no negative feedback about it.</p>\n<p>Then the market shifted. In that case, it was C++ to Java, but the details don\u2019t really matter. And we were unable to adapt. We ended up buying a bunch of companies to have new products for our sales force because we weren\u2019t coming up with them ourselves. To do more acquisitions, it gets more complex because you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got this other company full of process, and eventually, we drowned.</p>\n<p>And so, I think of process as: it all feels good, but it builds up like barnacles on a boat. If you don\u2019t, every now and then, scrape off the barnacles, then eventually a storm comes, and it sinks the boat. We always think about it a little like technical debt, another software metaphor. You\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got to go in and scrape the barnacles and really try to get rid of process. Because I failed in that way in the past, I at least want to fail in a novel way this time.</p>\n<p><strong>Ben:</strong> All new mistakes.</p>\n<p><strong>Reed:</strong> That\u2019s it. We\u2019re pushing super hard into employee freedom, pushing into anti-process, as hard as we can.</p>\n<span class=\"bctt-click-to-tweet\"><span class=\"bctt-ctt-text\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https://a16z.com/2020/09/15/a16z-podcast-designing-a-culture-of-reinvention/&amp;text=I%20think%20of%20process%20as%3A%20it%20all%20feels%20good%2C%20but%20it%20builds%20up%20like%20barnacles%20on%20a%20boat.%20If%20you%20don%27t%2C%20every%20now%20and%20then%2C%20scrape%20off%20the%20barnacles%2C%20then%20eventually%20a%20storm%20comes%2C%20and%20it%20sinks%20the%20boat.%20-Reed%20Hastings&amp;via=a16z&amp;related=a16z\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">I think of process as: it all feels good, but it builds up like barnacles on a boat.

Why write this book now? You also had a co-author, which I thought was interesting. It wasn\u2019t the normal co-author ghostwriter. It was almost like, \u201cWell, what\u2019s Reed saying? Yeah, that part is true. I was wondering about this part,\u201d that kind of thing. Why that approach?</p>\n<p><strong>Reed:</strong> Your books exempted, I have read way too many CEO pontification books, where the CEO says how great things are. I always wonder, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat\u2019s the reality? What\u2019s really happening in that company?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Now and then, I\u2019ve got friends who work there, and I can get a beat on it, and it\u2019s almost never what the CEO thinks.</p>\n<p>Of course, I knew that would be true at Netflix, too. So, I thought let me get someone really independent, who is a business school professor and has their own reputation, and give them open access to Netflix. They can interview anyone and everyone and report the reality to the reader.</p>\n<p>The book is me pontificating, going through the theory, which I like doing, and then Erin saying, this is her observation of the reality from dealing with all the employees.</p>\n<p>She had formerly written an incredible book \u201cCulture Map,\u201d which is about national cultures within a corporation. If you\u2019re a global company, and you have a lot of Koreans and Germans and Brazilians and Dutch and English and Japanese, who are misunderstanding each other, then to read her book \u201cCulture Map\u201d is incredible. So, I knew she had a good insight about culture.</p>\n<p><strong>Ben:</strong> Right. And did you end up learning things about Netflix. How did that process go with regards to actually running the company?</p>\n<p><strong>Reed:</strong> As you would expect, if you have a good anthropologist spend a lot of time with 100 people, you pick up things \u00e2\u0080\u0093 not that they are completely new, but their relative weighting \u00e2\u0080\u0093 like the fact that we felt and feel like such an American company. I had thought, \u201cOh, we\u2019re really doing well. I\u2019m becoming pretty global.\u201d And our Korean or our Dutch employees are like, \u201cWow, this is a super American company.\u201d Worse, a Californian company.</p>\n<p>We still have a way to go to get to the Holy Grail where everyone feels they have an equal chance to thrive whether you\u2019re an employee for us in Mexico City or in Mumbai.</p>\n<h2><div data-toc-header=\"What is culture?\" id=\"section--8\"></div>What is culture?</h2>\n<p><strong>Ben:</strong> We\u2019ve been talking about culture, but culture means a lot of different things to a lot of different people. It\u2019s a very overloaded word. When you speak of culture in the context of Netflix, what do you mean?</p>\n<p><strong>Reed:</strong> I think company culture is the behaviors that get you promoted or get you let go. Everyone, when they go into a company, has to figure out: What\u2019s the real culture? What are the values and behaviors that are rewarded, and which ones are violations?</p>\n<p>Sometimes there\u2019s a written culture, and sometimes companies follow that written culture. Other times, there\u2019s a written culture, like Enron famously had respect, integrity, but those weren\u2019t actually what got people promoted. What got them promoted was trading profits, and then people cut corners to do that, and eventually, the company blew up. In any company, the real culture is shown by who gets rewarded and who gets pushed out.</p>\n<span class=\"bctt-click-to-tweet\"><span class=\"bctt-ctt-text\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https://a16z.com/2020/09/15/a16z-podcast-designing-a-culture-of-reinvention/&amp;text=In%20any%20company%2C%20the%20real%20culture%20is%20shown%20by%20who%20gets%20rewarded%20and%20who%20gets%20pushed%20out.&amp;via=a16z&amp;related=a16z\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">In any company, the real culture is shown by who gets rewarded and who gets pushed out. </a></span><a class=\"bctt-ctt-btn\" href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https://a16z.com/2020/09/15/a16z-podcast-designing-a-culture-of-reinvention/&amp;text=In%20any%20company%2C%20the%20real%20culture%20is%20shown%20by%20who%20gets%20rewarded%20and%20who%20gets%20pushed%20out.&amp;via=a16z&amp;related=a16z\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Click To Tweet</a></span>\n<p><strong>Ben:</strong> When you describe the Netflix culture, you do it in a very different way than we\u2019re used to seeing in books. Usually a written culture starts with these values, integrity and so forth, but you more describe it as a system. There are these pillars in the system: candor, talent density, and rule removal \u00e2\u0080\u0093 getting rid of rules. They\u2019re interdependent, and then you also speak of layering them. You start with the talent density concept, and then you add a little candor, and then you remove a little rules, and then you cycle through the thing again. Increase your talent density, increase the amount of feedback people get, and then you can remove more rules. Could you describe why you have this interdependent view of culture that\u2019s so different from the way it\u2019s ordinarily described?</p>\n<p><strong>Reed:</strong> Let\u2019s separate two things. There\u2019s what our culture is, and then there\u2019s, if you want to go in this direction, here are some ways to go about it. Now, for what a culture is, we try to describe precisely behaviors that are rewarded and that managers can be held accountable for. It\u2019s an employee Bill of Rights in a way that\u2019s in our culture memo.</p>\n<p>I picked this up from Jack Welch\u2019s book <em>Winning</em>, Chapter 3. He describes that in the past he put generalities \u00e2\u0080\u0093 integrity, communication \u00e2\u0080\u0093 but those were not near specific enough. He\u2019s now much more long-form and specific about how to approach business problems and how to grow a great business, which is going to be unique for each company.</p>\n<p>You can google Netflix culture and <a href=\"https://jobs.netflix.com/culture\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">read our current memo</a>, and the 10 behaviors there. That forms two ways. One is, it\u2019s us saying to new employees what we want, which helps people select in or select out. It\u2019s also a Bill of Rights that an employee is entitled to see those behaviors rewarded, and if they see that management is inconsistent \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and we\u2019re not perfect \u00e2\u0080\u0093 compared to those values, it gives them something to refer to and to call us to account.</p>\n<p>The question you brought up with this sort of spiral notion of do a little more. That was really Erin\u2019s innovation as a book device to help people build confidence because it\u2019s pretty hard to go from cultures with a lot of systems and process, to the next week, no process and no rules. That\u2019s chaotic. We sat and talked through a way to go about it. It\u2019s a mechanism, or our best guess, on the way an existing company can absorb this set of ideas if they want to.</p>\n<h2><div data-toc-header=\"Feedback makes you stronger\" id=\"section--9\"></div>Feedback makes you stronger</h2>\n<p><strong>Ben:</strong> In getting to the Netflix culture, one of the things you talk about that you value is challenging your boss. We\u2019re all flawed human beings, including bosses. That\u2019s a behavior you want, but often a boss will not reward that necessarily. How does that end up working inside of Netflix, so that you don\u2019t end up with a hypocritical culture where somebody challenges the boss and is punished?</p>\n<p><strong>Reed:</strong> Certainly, if they\u2019re punished, that\u2019s going to end all feedback. But even more strongly, because it\u2019s abnormal to criticize the boss, in a way dangerous, the boss has to go out of their way to farm for dissent.</p>\n<p>I do an exercise with our executives: \u201cIf you were CEO, what would be different at Netflix?\u201d They have to list the top three things that would be different and that could be: we\u2019d be in China, where we\u2019re not, or it could be, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re in sports, or it could be we would pay higher or lower, or it could be as trivial as we\u2019d have better food. That forces them to say, \u201cIf I were CEO what would be different?\u201d That\u2019s one exercise in farming for dissent.</p>\n<p>Then there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s when you\u2019re lucky to get feedback. I\u2019ll laud the person often publicly with their permission: \u00e2\u0080\u009cperson X told me this, that was a hard piece of feedback, but it is fair.\u00e2\u0080\u009d It\u2019s giving them psychic rewards where other people think, \u201cOh, that person was gutsy and did that.\u201d At multiple levels, you want to overcome people\u2019s reticence to provide useful feedback to power figures.</p>\n<span class=\"bctt-click-to-tweet\"><span class=\"bctt-ctt-text\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https://a16z.com/2020/09/15/a16z-podcast-designing-a-culture-of-reinvention/&amp;text=I%27ll%20do%20an%20exercise%20with%20our%20executives%3A%20%27If%20you%20were%20CEO%2C%20what%20would%20be%20different%20at%20Netflix%3F%27%20-Reed%20Hastings&amp;via=a16z&amp;related=a16z\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">I'll do an exercise with our executives: 'If you were CEO, what would be different at Netflix?' -Reed Hastings </a></span><a class=\"bctt-ctt-btn\" href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https://a16z.com/2020/09/15/a16z-podcast-designing-a-culture-of-reinvention/&amp;text=I%27ll%20do%20an%20exercise%20with%20our%20executives%3A%20%27If%20you%20were%20CEO%2C%20what%20would%20be%20different%20at%20Netflix%3F%27%20-Reed%20Hastings&amp;via=a16z&amp;related=a16z\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Click To Tweet</a></span>\n<p><strong>Ben:</strong> That\u2019s such a great question, by the way, how would you run Netflix, if you were in my seat? It\u2019s just such a great question to get people to speak up on things that would otherwise seem very dangerous.</p>\n<p>With managers, how do you get them to do that, because you\u2019re asking a question, where in some way, emotionally at least, you don\u2019t want to know the answer. How does that training work? Is that a difficult thing to get them to do?</p>\n<p><strong>Reed:</strong> It\u2019s generally easy to get them to critique pricing strategy or something that\u2019s economic. And it\u2019s harder to get them to say, \u201cWell, if I were CEO, we would have a more empathetic CEO.\u201d In other words, personal characteristics. There are things that are product, economic \u00e2\u0080\u0093 you can have more films or less TV \u00e2\u0080\u0093 that are not personal critiques.</p>\n<p>When you get a personal critique\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 for me at least, even though I have accomplished all these things, when someone that I respect, one of our executives, in particular, gives me feedback that\u2019s not positive, it hurts. I\u2019m like, \u201cOh my God. No, no, no. You don\u2019t understand.\u201d I\u2019m defensive. And then I just stop myself and remember getting feedback, and the pain, is like doing crunches or push-ups. You want to stop, you know it hurts, and you know that it\u2019s the painful ones that make you stronger. Ray Dalio talks a bunch about this. If you contain your ego, and if you can take the pain, you\u2019ll get stronger, and you\u2019ll get better as a leader.</p>\n<p>Then instead of arguing with the person, I\u2019ll say, \u00e2\u0080\u009cTell me more? What else?\u201d And just keep hitting those two, \u201cTell me more? What else?\u201d And it\u2019ll be amazing what comes out. It really hurts, but that\u2019s what makes you better.</p>\n<p>To play on the exercise metaphor, if you\u2019re a trainer for someone and you beat them, that\u2019s not helpful. We always want the feedback to be constructive. Yes, we want honesty and candor, but not your drunken self-spouting off random things. What we mean is professional, helpful. It can be direct. It can still hurt, but it\u2019s within the bounds of the professional self. It\u2019s not critiquing or sharing other things that you might or might not think \u00e2\u0080\u0093 I\u2019ll call that your drunk self. It\u2019s keeping that stuff to the side. It\u2019s not unleashing that, but it\u2019s making your professional self much more open.</p>\n<p>Another thing we say is don\u2019t say something about a colleague that you haven\u2019t or won\u2019t say to them. If you are working at Netflix at any level and you come to me and say, \u201cYou know, Ted Sarandos, my co-CEO, he\u2019s got this, this, and that problem.\u201d Then I say, \u201cWell, that\u2019s interesting. What did he say when you told him that?\u201d And then, they will look at me all frozen. \u201cWell, I can\u2019t tell them that.\u201d And I\u2019m like, \u201cYes, you can.\u201d And that\u2019s the first line.</p>\n<p>When people are talking about other colleagues, which is normal and fine, just keep pressing them with, \u201cOh, and what did they say when you asked them about that?\u201d That stimulates directness.</p>\n<span class=\"bctt-click-to-tweet\"><span class=\"bctt-ctt-text\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https://a16z.com/2020/09/15/a16z-podcast-designing-a-culture-of-reinvention/&amp;text=Getting%20feedback%2C%20and%20the%20pain%2C%20is%20like%20doing%20crunches%20or%20push-ups.%20You%20want%20to%20stop%2C%20you%20know%20it%20hurts%2C%20and%20you%20know%20that%20it%27s%20the%20painful%20ones%20that%20make%20you%20stronger.%20-Reed%20Hastings&amp;via=a16z&amp;related=a16z\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Getting feedback, and the pain, is like doing crunches or push-ups.

Tell us a little bit about how you got past that.</p>\n<p><strong>Reed:</strong> Japan, as an island culture and a very cohesive homogeneous culture, has developed a high art form of giving feedback very indirectly. They call it \u00e2\u0080\u009creading the air.\u00e2\u0080\u009d If we\u2019re both Japanese, without saying anything inappropriate verbally, I can give you a bunch of feedback and be very confident you got the message.</p>\n<p>When interacting with Americans, we don\u2019t know that art form, and so they\u2019ll say something and we\u2019re supposed to interpret it as \u00e2\u0080\u009cno way\u00e2\u0080\u009d or \u00e2\u0080\u009cyes\u00e2\u0080\u009d or \u00e2\u0080\u009cI wish you did this differently or that.\u00e2\u0080\u009d And we completely miss it because we don\u2019t know how to read the air, and they don\u2019t know that we can\u2019t. It\u2019s definitely a big challenge.</p>\n<p>Two, the Confucian cultures have a high deference to elders, so critiquing anyone in power is doubly hard. Then, related to reading the air, if they do critiques in public, that\u2019s triply hard. I say to our Americans, \u201cFor a Japanese to receive criticism in public would be like you yelling at them in American culture, where it\u2019s really emotionally charged, and they interpret it that way.\u201d</p>\n<p>What we have to do is help both sides understand each other, and that\u2019s where Erin\u2019s <em>Culture Map</em> book is so good. We say, \u201cLook, we standardized on English because it takes too long for the rest of the world to learn Japanese and standardize on that, and we do need one language to communicate. In this dimension of giving feedback, we\u2019re going to go with the American style of verbal feedback because we can all learn that around the world.\u201d</p>\n<p>Then what we\u2019ve tried to do is give permission to our Japanese colleagues to do that, including doing dinners where we all have to give feedback to each other. What you\u2019re trying to do there is role model the behavior, so that they feel like it\u2019s acceptable.</p>\n<p>To give you another example where we changed the culture \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Americans form trust by doing tasks. If you go into a meeting and you barely know another employee, but then you work on a project together, and it\u2019s done well, then you have high trust because you trust their competence. We build trust that way, and we see chit chat about kids and baseball teams in a meeting as inefficient. Americans are very efficient.</p>\n<p>Brazilians are very much relationship builders. They want to take meals and really talk about family and society and religion and sports. Then, we\u2019ll do the work, and we\u2019ll trust each other at work because we\u2019ve got this basis. They\u2019re different styles. What we realized is actually the Brazilian style is more efficient, because if you\u2019ve got a strong relationship with people, then you can give good feedback. You have that kind of emotional caring for each other.</p>\n<p>About five years ago, when we started doing a lot of work in Brazil, we realized that we should really shift our culture to be more relationship-oriented. And so, we\u2019ll open meetings and talk about parents and kids and animals, sports and news, and we\u2019ll spend 5% or 10% of the time on that, and then we\u2019ll get to the real topics. We want a consistent style around the world of expectations, so that managers can be on the same page.</p>\n<p><strong>Ben:</strong> And I know it\u2019s coming from a good place because I already had the conversation with you about my kids, and you remembered my kids. That ends up being, at a high performing American company, like Netflix, a key cultural element that you run out and grab.</p>\n<p><strong>Reed:</strong> That\u2019s right. The strength of the relationship allows the effectiveness of the feedback. The narrow inefficiency of taking that time turns out actually to be well worthwhile.</p>\n<h2><div data-toc-header=\"Optimizing for innovation (not efficiency)\" id=\"section--11\"></div>Optimizing for innovation (not efficiency)</h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif\"><strong>Reed:</strong> Now, we\u2019re diving into feedback, but we should back up a little bit.

It\u2019s clean, efficient, sanitary, sterile, and our model is messy and chaotic and fertile. And in the long term fertile will beat sterile, but in the short term, sterile is very good.</p>\n<p>You have to be very conscious as a leader how you\u2019re optimizing for long-term innovation. Manufacturing has dominated the economy for 200 years. There\u2019s this big influence from manufacturing, because it\u2019s generated most of the economic wealth of the past couple hundred years, around the boss and the worker and the worker following the rules. You want zero variation. That\u2019s nirvana.</p>\n<p>And yet, if you\u2019re an innovation culture, variation is essential. At core, an innovation culture is around increasing variation, and a manufacturing culture, like 5-sigma, is around decreasing variation. In manufacturing and in safety \u00e2\u0080\u0093 think of hospitals and airlines \u00e2\u0080\u0093 you want perfect process, full compliance, and that is the right way to manage those businesses, which are most of the economy. Then there\u2019s this creative sector, which we\u2019re both in, and as managers we\u2019ve inherited a cultural legacy that is highly optimized for manufacturing and safety with process, OKRs, and all these ideas to manage creativity, but, in fact, we really need to create a fertile ecosystem and not try to manage it too much, and yet not have it be chaotic.</p>\n<p>There just hasn\u2019t been enough thinking about what\u2019s unique about creative companies. For creative companies, the fundamental risk is lack of innovation \u00e2\u0080\u0093 not execution and efficiency, bringing costs down, those kinds of manufacturing things. It\u2019s really are you organized for innovation? We\u2019re trying to make a contribution around what would you do to optimize creativity. We think that\u2019s around employee freedom, which is supported by the no rules context.</p>\n<p>Other people have other ideas, but they are still about how do you have a company that is able to do new inventions. Let\u2019s take Amazon, an incredible company that has done amazing amounts of innovation, arguably more than Netflix. They\u2019re not nearly as much as we are about freedom and no rules, but they\u2019re about two pizza lunches, and they\u2019re so willing to fail. They can do that whole mobile phone disaster, and then once in a while, they have an Alexa, and it changes the world.</p>\n<p>Over time the innovation sector will see that there\u2019s a couple of different approaches and find the best way to combine them.</p>\n<p><strong>Ben:</strong> Yours is very interesting because it is, at its core, a cultural approach. Whereas when I think about Jeff Bezos, he goes into what you said \u00e2\u0080\u0093 willingness to take very high risks. It gets back, though, to a cultural thing. Is it rewarded in the culture to take that high risk or is it punished when you fail? And he\u2019s very thoughtful about how you reward it.</p>\n<p><strong>Reed:</strong> And Google is a fascinating one because, of course, 10 years ago they were all about 20% time, and now that\u2019s all gone. What did they learn? It\u2019s pretty hard to do innovation one day a week. The big innovations that they did are things like Android and Google Drive and Google Docs \u00e2\u0080\u0093 massive projects. I\u2019m guessing that they probably learned that, \u201cHey, at Google the way we innovate is we can put hundreds of people on big ideas, and it\u2019s no longer, part-time innovation that matters.\u201d</p>\n<p><strong>Ben:</strong> Google\u2019s approach to innovation always seemed to me to be this super courageous, but top-down set of ideas. We want to build an autonomous car, and we\u2019re going to put unlimited money for unlimited years into that, and that\u2019s an amazing thing to do. But your idea is almost the opposite, which is, \u201cLook, we\u2019ve got all these creative people here, and if we get rid of the rules that constrain their thinking, they will come up with the innovation, and there won\u2019t be any rule against them continuing with that innovation and building it. There\u2019s nobody who\u2019s going to say \u201cNo\u00e2\u0080\u009d because we don\u2019t have any rules.\u201d</p>\n<p><strong>Reed:</strong> In that way, Netflix and Amazon are closer to those bottom-up innovations, but Amazon has more lines of business. We\u2019re still basically a one-service company, so we\u2019re earlier in the phase. In Google terms, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099d be as if we only had search.</p>\n<h2><div data-toc-header=\"Reinventing Netflix, from DVD to Streaming\" id=\"section--12\"></div>Reinventing Netflix, from DVD to Streaming</h2>\n<p><strong>Ben:</strong> You did run into at Netflix a very important turning point where, if you had continued to optimize the DVD business instead of getting to the streaming business, you would\u2019ve had a huge problem. Can you tell us a little bit about that because you also kind of screwed it up? I remember you saying, somewhat thanks to my business partner Marc Andreessen who was very much about eject DVDs and go into the future. Could you tell us about that transition?</p>\n<p><strong>Reed:</strong> Typically, venture capitalists say that you want to go after the largest market possible.

The practical thing on how big it is, is can it hold 5 or 10 years of growth? So, back to DVD, by the time we got to 2005, we realized that DVD was probably going to peak about 2010. It could no longer hold our 5 or 10-year growth ambitions. Then we had to figure out how to expand the market definition. We said, \u201cOkay, now is the time. We\u2019ve got to expand into streaming.\u201d</p>\n<p>In 2007, YouTube had just started. Google had just bought it at the beginning of 2007. Hulu started. Amazon did a thing called Unbox, which was their Internet delivery on video, and Netflix started streaming. All four of us entered basically in \u201907, and since then it\u2019s been a rocket ship.</p>\n<p><strong>Ben:</strong> For multiple companies.</p>\n<p><strong>Reed:</strong> Yes, that\u2019s right. It was a big enough market. There was a play there. And Hulu was doing really well. It was owned by three of the major media companies, and to some degree, they were positioning it as: if you care about DVD and streaming, Netflix is okay, but if you really care about streaming, Hulu is the solution.</p>\n<p>Our marketing played into this because the easiest way to differentiate against Hulu was, \u201cWell, we have DVDs, too.\u201d The problem was that was going to be a fading value to consumers. We had to say to our marketers, \u201cYou can\u2019t talk about it. We\u2019ve got to strip it away because you\u2019re going to make us dependent on a thing that\u2019s going to become irrelevant, and we have to be, full stop, the best streaming service and to win on that basis.\u201d</p>\n<p>In fact, we had to have DVD and streaming be separate, so that streaming had to fight and win and be better than Hulu as a streaming service. So, partially goaded by the wonderfully radical Marc Andreessen who was like, \u201cburn the boats,\u201d we came up with this plan to separate DVD and streaming.</p>\n<p>We made one tragic mistake in it. The pricing for the combined plan had been $10, and the separate plans we set were $8 for streaming, which was about Hulu\u2019s price, and $8 for DVD. It was effectively a 60% price increase. We sent an email to 20 million American families, so 20% of American society, on one day, saying the price is going up by 60%, and you get to use two services, two websites instead of one. Less convenience, radically higher price in the middle of a recession.</p>\n<p><strong>Ben:</strong> And no new features.</p>\n<p><strong>Reed:</strong> And no new features. It did not go well. I explained it as essential for Netflix\u2019s long-term, which it was.</p>\n<p><strong>Ben:</strong> Yeah, they [customers] don\u2019t care about you.</p>\n<p><strong>Reed:</strong> Oh, my God, it was crazy bad. The stock went down 75%. Lots of members quit. Saturday Night Live did skits making fun of us. It was nightmarish.</p>\n<p>We realized that this was going to be a challenge to get out of, and we slowly had to earn back the trust of customers. We basically switched it from Qwikster to DVD.com. Now, if you go to DVD.com, that\u2019s our DVD service. We have a little under 2 million members that are still DVD subscribers. We have nearly 200 million who are streaming. We were right to separate them. It\u2019s just we did it an awful way.</p>\n<p>We did the thing that Kodak never did, that AOL never did, that Blockbuster never did. We transitioned our business successfully, but we did not stick the landing. We landed ugly.</p>\n<span class=\"bctt-click-to-tweet\"><span class=\"bctt-ctt-text\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https://a16z.com/2020/09/15/a16z-podcast-designing-a-culture-of-reinvention/&amp;text=We%20did%20the%20thing%20that%20Kodak%20never%20did%2C%20that%20AOL%20never%20did%2C%20that%20Blockbuster%20never%20did.%20We%20transitioned%20our%20business%20successfully%2C%20but%20we%20did%20not%20stick%20the%20landing.%20We%20landed%20ugly.%20&amp;via=a16z&amp;related=a16z\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">We did the thing that Kodak never did, that AOL never did, that Blockbuster never did.

That took six months or a year because it was just a crisis of: What are we going to cut? How are we going to survive? Our General Counsel joked that he had worked at Webvan, so at least he had bankruptcy skills. It was gallows humor.</p>\n<p>After we healed, we said, \u201cOkay, what went wrong?\u201d The first level answer was an arrogant CEO who didn\u2019t listen to his people, a King Lear kind of thing. For the most part, that\u2019s not what happened. What happened was something more subtle. Our leading people were too deferential. They were like, \u201cReed\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been right so many times. I think this is going to be bad, but he must see something.\u00e2\u0080\u009d</p>\n<p>They didn\u2019t know that each of them felt the same way. In hindsight, if we had said, \u201cAll execs, write down your level of confidence in this move, disaster to genius,\u201d it would\u2019ve come up that 20 people think it\u2019s going to be bad. With the strength of their shared feeling, they would\u2019ve realized, \u201cNo, we\u2019re right. Reed is wrong.\u201d Then, probably, we would\u2019ve stopped.</p>\n<p>We said, in the future, all major decisions, we will have everybody write down what they think +10 to -10 and why. We do that in a Google Sheet, but any shared medium is fine. Then everyone knows what everyone else thinks in writing. That little device has helped us avoid chaos and catastrophe.</p>\n<p><strong>Ben:</strong> That\u2019s such a great device. It\u2019s very deceiving when you\u2019re a CEO because it\u2019s at the point when you are right consistently and feeling confident that you cause that problem.

Blockbuster dogfight\" id=\"section--13\"></div>The Netflix v. Blockbuster dogfight</h2>\n<p><strong>Ben: </strong>If a business was in like a dogfight competitive battle in its current market, would you still drive for innovation or would you need to optimize more for efficiency?</p>\n<p><strong>Reed:</strong> Probably a little more optimized. When we were in the DVD fight with Blockbuster in \u201905 to \u201907, we got distracted doing magic charms.</p>\n<p>We did four things to make ourselves feel better. We went into selling used DVDs directly on our website rather than on eBay. We started buying some little films at Sundance, like a Maggie Gyllenhaal film, for original content. We launched a private social network called Netflix Friends, and this was 2005, Facebook was barely out of Harvard. You could see each other\u2019s queue and viewing history, if you gave each other permissions. And we sold banner advertising on our website, like Overstock used to do. It was four nontrivial engineering efforts that to differentiate us against Blockbuster.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, we also spent some time getting shipping more reliable, so our queue fulfillment rate went from 96% to 98%. In the end, once we beat Blockbuster, we realized the only thing that mattered was that queue fulfillment rate, the 96% to 98%.</p>\n<p>We, as leaders, did not have the courage to stand before the employees and say, \u201cWe\u2019re going to win because we can move this from 96% to 98%.\u201d We needed these little magic charms to make ourselves feel good. It was totally bad management to get distracted by those magic charms.</p>\n<p>Having the confidence to focus on the basics and doing the basics incredibly well is important. That lesson is more of a business strategy lesson than a culture lesson, so it\u2019s not in the book, but that lesson is what\u2019s fueled our focus on movies and series and not sports and video games and user-generated content and all kinds of other things.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s always a balance when you\u2019re in that dogfight.

None of it is golden tablets. We\u2019re constantly trying to improve the culture.</p>\n<p>Most people have the default idea that as you get bigger, you start sucking. It gets political, it gets bureaucratic. But if you want to effect the world at scale, you want to grow. You\u2019re making a choice not to be a boutique restaurant in your neighborhood where you\u2019re fantastic, but you don\u2019t change the world. Most of us take the trade-off to get bigger, which is harder, because then we can have more impact in the world.</p>\n<p>The key thing is to get people to believe that it\u2019s possible to get better as you get bigger. Then you have to really show the examples of where you\u2019re getting better as you get bigger.</p>\n<p>Now, it is harder as you get bigger, but think of Malthus, who 250 years ago thought the whole world was going to starve once we got to above a billion people. Totally wrong. What he didn\u2019t understand is that they\u2019re going to be a lot of people thinking about how to have increased food productivity, and in fact, you\u2019d have less starvation than 250 years ago instead of more. He missed that.</p>\n<p>Now, as Netflix grows, we have more people thinking about how to improve the culture. Yes, it\u2019s harder, but we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got more brainpower working on it, and people are coming up with ideas.</p>\n<p>A big example would be about four years ago, we added inclusion as a core value, and we\u2019ve been working hard on it, and we\u2019ve made real progress. I wish that I had led that 10 years ago, but I didn\u2019t. I wish I had led it at all, but it was brought to me as something that really needed to be done. I\u2019m on board, and we\u2019re driving it, but it\u2019s a real improvement because we\u2019ve got more people thinking about it. Now, of our top 20 leaders, we\u2019re half men, half women. We\u2019re 25% leaders of color in our top 20. That\u2019s been a great improvement that was really driven by all the new talent at Netflix.</p>\n<p><strong>Ben:</strong> Really interesting. It is challenging, in particular, getting everybody to participate in a culture at scale. It\u2019s probably the greatest management challenge there is.</p>\n<p>Final question, and you had such colorful answers to this in The Wall Street Journal. How has COVID-19 impacted Netflix? Do you feel the company is in a better place to react to crises because of its cultural reinvention?</p>\n<p><strong>Reed:</strong> I love work from home. I\u2019ve been doing work from home my whole life nights and weekends. I think it\u2019s always a great part of the mix. I do think that exclusive work from home, where you don\u2019t have any in-person contact, is not good, but work from home as part of the work experience is fantastic.</p>\n<p>And then, is Netflix differentially able to adapt? Maybe, but I don\u2019t know, and it kind of doesn\u2019t matter, because COVID, fortunately, is a one in 100 years phenomenon. We\u2019re not trying to draw great cultural lessons from it. Instead, we\u2019re trying to think of the things that we\u2019ll need to be good at for 5, 10, 20 years. We\u2019re all making do. I do hope that we\u2019ll have a vaccine soon, that many people will get it, and that we\u2019ll eliminate COVID from society and be back to normal next year.

That lean-back, hands-free experience means that audio apps generally don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t compete with a vast competitive library of other startups. Instead, they compete with washing dishes, working out, driving. This dynamic is akin to the competitive landscape for mobile apps 10 years ago. Early entrants were competing with waiting in line, sitting in bed, and staring at the ceiling while riding a bus\u00e2\u0080\u0094and <a href=\"https://a16z.com/2020/12/07/social-strikes-back-fastest-growing-apps\">achieved hypergrowth</a>, as a result. Easy competition! Today, traditional apps are just one notification or swipe away from losing users to Instagram, iMessage, or thousands of other engaging apps. In contrast, audio startups face a less crowded and less competitive landscape.</span><a href=\"https://a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/The-Next-Phase-of-Social_-Listen-Closely-v6_The-Evolution-of-Audio-v2-scaled.jpg\"><br/>\n</a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Unlike much of social media, which just shows the highlights\u00e2\u0080\u0094the amazing travel adventures, the huge mansions and cars, fitness influencers, or people with amazing dance skills\u00e2\u0080\u0094audio hits different. Listening to someone\u00e2\u0080\u0099s voice is personal, and hearing unedited audio is the opposite of seeing the highlights. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s about ideas, not the visuals, so it emphasizes a different kind of content that can often feel deeper and more intellectually stimulating. When you listen to Elon Musk get interviewed by Joe Rogan for two hours, you may begin to develop a deeper understanding of how he thinks\u00e2\u0080\u0094beyond the headlines. When you listen to a comedian like Tina Fey read her autobiographical audiobook over multiple hours, you start to feel an emotional bond with the person. When you listen to a live conversation on Clubhouse and hear people talk over each other, all the \u00e2\u0080\u009cums,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and sometimes awkward silences, it reminds you\u00e2\u0080\u0094in a shelter-in-place era\u00e2\u0080\u0094what a lively dinner conversation is supposed to feel like.</span><a href=\"https://a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/The-Next-Phase-of-Social_-Listen-Closely-v6_The-Evolution-of-Audio-v2-scaled.jpg\"><br/>\n</a></p>\n<h2><b>Beyond podcasts</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The most obvious killer app for audio is podcasting. In recent years, listening to podcasts has </span><a href=\"https://a16z.com/2019/05/23/podcast-ecosystem-investing-2019/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">become more mainstream</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">; today, more than half the US population has listened to roughly a million shows. In parallel, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen the rise of more podcast </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">creators</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, and much more volume, thanks to podcasting tools and hardware. With tools like Descript (which democratizes the editing of podcasts and videos), Anchor (which makes hosting and distribution easier), and others, you don\u2019t even need a fancy mic or studio setup to participate in the experience. The content creators behind shows like Joe Rogan, Call Her Daddy, and others are already highly sought after, paid millions of dollars to reach millions of fans. But while podcasting is a massive, growing market\u00e2\u0080\u0094and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re certainly excited to see further innovations there\u00e2\u0080\u0094it\u2019s often solitary and one-sided. We believe there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s even more opportunity for audio-first products that go beyond passive listening.\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In particular, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re excited to see the emergence of platforms that provide user-generated content, live conversations, and other social interactions; a counterpoint to the highly produced, one-way nature of audiobooks and podcasts. That emotion that audio can stoke\u00e2\u0080\u0094the swell of a concert, a baby\u2019s laugh, the roar of a stadium crowd\u00e2\u0080\u0094is inherently social. Podcasting scratches the surface, in that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a network of user-generated creators and listeners, but there\u2019s ample opportunity to go deeper.</span><a href=\"https://a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/The-Next-Phase-of-Social_-Listen-Closely-v6_The-Evolution-of-Audio-v2-scaled.jpg\"><br/>\n</a></p>\n<div class=\"widget widget--subscribe widget--subscribe-inline widget--subscribe-theme-default\" data-subscribe-instance=\"1\">\n<div id=\"widget-signup-form-1\">\n<h3 class=\"widget__title\"><span>The inside take on the future of tech.</span></h3>\n<p>Sign up to the a16z newsletter to learn about the tech trends reshaping our world and the people behind them.</p>\n<div class=\"input-wrap\">\n<form class=\"mktoForm\" data-formid=\"1560\" data-forminstance=\"subscribe-inline-content-1\" data-thankyou-container=\"#widget-signup-form-1\" data-thankyou-message=\"#widget-signup-ty-1\" id=\"mktoForm-1560\" target=\"_blank\"></form>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"thankyou-message\" id=\"widget-signup-ty-1\" style=\"display: none\">\n<div class=\"thankyou-message-inner\">\n<h4>Thanks for signing up.</h4>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<h2><b>The precedent for social+ audio</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">To glimpse where </span><a href=\"https://a16z.com/2020/12/07/social-strikes-back-social-plus/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">social+ audio</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> might go, <a href=\"https://a16z.com/2020/12/07/social-strikes-back-video/\">social+ video</a> provides a good point of comparison. Though </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">YouTube has dominated the video landscape</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> in the 15 years since its founding, it has since been joined by a small army of powerful challengers and upstarts. Today, </span><a href=\"https://a16z.com/2020/12/07/social-strikes-back-video/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u00e2\u0080\u009cvideo\u00e2\u0080\u009d spans a broad family of ideas</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> and business models, including YouTube\u00e2\u0080\u0099s short video clips, Zoom\u00e2\u0080\u0099s video conferences, Snapchat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s stories, Twitch\u00e2\u0080\u0099s live streaming, TikTok\u00e2\u0080\u0099s dance videos, and dozens more variations. This encompasses not only stand-alone video products, but also embedded features within other products: collaboration tools, messaging apps, and much more. \u00e2\u0080\u009cVideo\u00e2\u0080\u009d refers to far more than just the technical format. Who creates the video? How is it delivered? When is it seen? Why was it sent? And what actions are the viewers invited to take? These questions all matter\u00e2\u0080\u0094and they define products much more deeply than the blanket term of \u00e2\u0080\u009cvideo apps.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Remarkably, rather than a single product coming to dominate all forms of video, TikTok, Twitch, and YouTube have all come to inhabit different corners of the market, each independently worth many billions of dollars.</span><a href=\"https://a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/The-Next-Phase-of-Social_-Listen-Closely-v6_The-Evolution-of-Audio-v2-scaled.jpg\"><br/>\n</a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Looking at audio through the lens of the user experience, the interactions are similar to video in some ways and radically different in others. Like video, audio can provide a lean-back experience that users can enjoy for hours at a time. Just as it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s compelling to watch influencers and celebrities, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also enjoyable to listen to them\u00e2\u0080\u0094particularly in comedy, sports, news, politics, and other \u00e2\u0080\u009ctalk radio\u00e2\u0080\u009d categories that have had massive adoption in the radio era. In addition, audio, like video, lends itself well to fiction, non-fiction, and many other categories. Video is easily created by everyone, thanks to the camera on our pocket-sized supercomputers; similarly, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s familiar and easy to create audio content using our phones. However, audio also scales to professional settings, where podcasting has demonstrated the power of high-quality, edited audio content.\u00c2\u00a0</span><a href=\"https://a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/The-Next-Phase-of-Social_-Listen-Closely-v6_The-Evolution-of-Audio-v2-scaled.jpg\"><br/>\n</a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In the same way, though audio apps may have begun with podcasting and audio books, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m convinced we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re on the front-end of a decade of innovation in social audio experiences.</span><a href=\"https://a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/The-Next-Phase-of-Social_-Listen-Closely-v6_The-Evolution-of-Audio-v2-scaled.jpg\"><br/>\n</a></p>\n<h2><b>How social audio might innovate</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">To see how future innovation might progress, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s helpful to survey </span><a href=\"https://a16z.com/2020/12/07/social-strikes-back-fastest-growing-apps\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">the current social-audio product landscape</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> in abstract and break down some of the defining attributes. There are many existing audio use cases that can be categorized in various different ways.</span><a href=\"https://a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/The-Next-Phase-of-Social_-Listen-Closely-v6_The-Evolution-of-Audio-v2-scaled.jpg\"><br/>\n</a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">One way to describe podcasting, for example, is that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a user-generated network. It consists mostly of semi-professional content creators broadcasting to a wide, public audience on a horizontal set of products and protocols. Users often discover new podcasts by following their favorite creators. The interaction is generally one-way, and the business model is advertising.</span><a href=\"https://a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/The-Next-Phase-of-Social_-Listen-Closely-v6_The-Evolution-of-Audio-v2-scaled.jpg\"><br/>\n</a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Similarly, we can use this type of language to break down a second category of social audio, a group call between three friends. There are many apps that can facilitate this, including FaceTime, which creates small networks of ephemeral conversation. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s socially motivated and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a lean-forward experience, since everyone is expected to talk.\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">An app like Clubhouse provides yet another example. The experience is somewhere between a conference call, a podcast, and a live talk show. Although the content is ephemeral, like a phone call, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also a horizontal and public platform, which is more like live podcasting.\u00c2\u00a0</span><a href=\"https://a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/The-Next-Phase-of-Social_-Listen-Closely-v6_The-Evolution-of-Audio-v2-scaled.jpg\"><br/>\n</a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Once we start to enumerate different social audio ideas, attributes, and use cases, an interesting set of patterns emerges.\u00c2\u00a0</span><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/The-Next-Phase-of-Social_-Listen-Closely-v6_A-social-audio-taxonomy-scaled.jpg?ssl=1\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-302444 size-full\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"2438\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/The-Next-Phase-of-Social_-Listen-Closely-v6_A-social-audio-taxonomy-scaled.jpg?resize=2560%2C2438&amp;ssl=1\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/The-Next-Phase-of-Social_-Listen-Closely-v6_A-social-audio-taxonomy-scaled.jpg?w=2560&amp;ssl=1 2560w, https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/The-Next-Phase-of-Social_-Listen-Closely-v6_A-social-audio-taxonomy-scaled.jpg?resize=300%2C286&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/The-Next-Phase-of-Social_-Listen-Closely-v6_A-social-audio-taxonomy-scaled.jpg?resize=1024%2C975&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/The-Next-Phase-of-Social_-Listen-Closely-v6_A-social-audio-taxonomy-scaled.jpg?resize=768%2C731&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/The-Next-Phase-of-Social_-Listen-Closely-v6_A-social-audio-taxonomy-scaled.jpg?resize=1536%2C1463&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/The-Next-Phase-of-Social_-Listen-Closely-v6_A-social-audio-taxonomy-scaled.jpg?resize=2048%2C1950&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/The-Next-Phase-of-Social_-Listen-Closely-v6_A-social-audio-taxonomy-scaled.jpg?resize=125%2C119&amp;ssl=1 125w, https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/The-Next-Phase-of-Social_-Listen-Closely-v6_A-social-audio-taxonomy-scaled.jpg?resize=263%2C250&amp;ssl=1 263w, https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/The-Next-Phase-of-Social_-Listen-Closely-v6_A-social-audio-taxonomy-scaled.jpg?resize=347%2C330&amp;ssl=1 347w, https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/The-Next-Phase-of-Social_-Listen-Closely-v6_A-social-audio-taxonomy-scaled.jpg?resize=662%2C630&amp;ssl=1 662w\" width=\"2560\"/></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">This list of product attributes is not meant to be exhaustive. Rather, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an initial framework designed to further our collective thinking of what might be possible in audio, particularly when many of these aspects are combined into a single product. If you were to mix and match each of the attributes above, there are many thousands of possible configurations that might lead to new, cohesive products.\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Of course, I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t expect each of these attributes to attract equal attention from entrepreneurs. Innovation will likely focus on a few leading decisions, which then help drive related attributes. Given that groundwork, I believe three themes will emerge: <strong>innovation in the content format, </strong></span><b>the evolution of the business model, and the growing ubiquity of audio.</b></p>\n<h2><b>Three themes shaping the future of social audio</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">One key product decision is the form factor of the content. On one end of the spectrum, we have seen products succeed in facilitating very short-form, easy-to-create written and video content\u00e2\u0080\u0094think Twitter and Snapchat Stories. On the opposite end of the spectrum, long-form writing has seen success on blogging platforms like WordPress and new platforms like Substack; long-form videos live on YouTube, as well as professional platforms like Netflix and Hulu. In the same way, both </span><b>long- and short-form content</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> are likely to thrive on audio-first platforms.\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Real-time voice communication is easy to create\u00e2\u0080\u0094particularly one short reply at a time\u00e2\u0080\u0094but is messy and full of digressions. If the effect is too unpolished, it might be less interesting for the listener. This is the Twitter analog for social audio. Clubhouse is one implementation of this idea (among others), but there are likely to be other approaches: some might be asynchronous rather than live, or focused on a particular niche of creators (comedians? news analysts? sports announcers?). On the long-form end of the spectrum, I expect there to be a rapid evolution from the podcasts and audiobooks of today. A future product might be long-form, with a twist\u00e2\u0080\u0094maybe it focuses on high-quality educational content or short stories from prominent authors. Perhaps the innovation will happen at the technology level, where a new platform could integrate monetization and tooling. Or perhaps the product will be built with social features so that listeners can interact with the content. There are many promising combinations.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The </span><b>business model for content creation</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> online has been evolving in recent years and is likely to accelerate in a world of </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">audio and social</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> platforms. In the past few years, startups like Substack, Patreon, and Shopify have created alternative ways for creators to build businesses online through </span><a href=\"https://a16z.com/2020/12/07/social-strikes-back-after-ads/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">direct transactions, rather than advertising</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. This shift exposed a simple fact: in an ad-driven world, creators were generally under-monetizing their audiences. Fans of creators were willing to pay more\u00e2\u0080\u0094a </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">lot</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> more. Newsletter authors like Jonah Goldberg of The Dispatch, for instance, can generate millions of dollars per year directly from reader subscriptions. The same trend is likely to happen in audio, where the podcast advertising business model is small relative to its adoption\u00e2\u0080\u0094under $1 billion\u00e2\u0080\u0094and unlikely to keep pace when rigorous targeting, measurement, and ROI tracking is stymied by archaic underlying technology. Instead, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s likely that creators will figure out how to directly charge their audiences. This might happen in the form of freemium\u00e2\u0080\u0094in which the basic service is free, but advanced features or product offerings are paid\u00e2\u0080\u0094perhaps through </span><a href=\"https://a16z.com/2020/12/07/social-strikes-back-after-ads/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">ticket sales to live events, or unlocking libraries of pre-recorded content</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. Combine these unique business models with a novel audio format or method of interaction and you might get something that really flies. After all, it wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t until a \u00e2\u0080\u009cnative\u00e2\u0080\u009d monetization method for search\u00e2\u0080\u0094sponsored keywords\u00e2\u0080\u0094was combined with the core interaction of the product that Google became what it was. In the near future, we will likely transcend sponsored promos to truly native social audio monetization, unlocking the next generation of social companies.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The final theme is around </span><b>ubiquity</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. In examining how messaging and chat has evolved, there has been a bifurcation between stand-alone apps and embedded features. Slack and WhatsApp are two examples of destinations for messaging: users build up distinct social networks of friends and colleagues and use these apps to communicate with them. But the other thing that happened to messaging is that it has gotten baked into many, many other apps\u00e2\u0080\u0094into Yelp\u00e2\u0080\u0099s UI to reach out to local businesses, for example, or into Uber\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ability to contact your driver. Snapchat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Stories feature famously originated within the photo/video messaging app, but now exists as part of LinkedIn\u00e2\u0080\u0099s professional networking feature set. The same transition is likely to happen in audio. We are already seeing inklings of this: Discord\u00e2\u0080\u0099s voice features to talk to other gamers is just one of several communication options within the network; text-driven services like Twitter are already offering the option of \u00e2\u0080\u009cvoice tweets.\u00e2\u0080\u009d As these features are integrated into more platforms and the volume of audio content grows, it will be increasingly likely to be incorporated as part of Alexa, smart appliances, in-car systems, and more. Such audio services may even fade into the background over time. Just as many apps today support messaging, over time they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re likely to support synchronous and asynchronous audio, as well.</span></p>\n<h2><b>The convergence of technology and human behavior</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Behavior is shaped by the constraints of technology, and in turn, technology is pushed forward by the needs and demands of consumers. When the telegraph was popularized in the 1800s, its rapid rate of transmission made it ideal for urgent and important messages. The invention of the printing press made it much cheaper and faster to create books and manuscripts, spurring a new era of mass media and allowing millions of people to interact with the written word. These inventions created new product categories and consumer demands\u00e2\u0080\u0094to be faster, to allow for voice, to be portable\u00e2\u0080\u0094leading to the telephone, the steam-powered printing press, typewriters, in turn causing the next waves of innovation. In the modern era, history repeats itself.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Audio, now squarely at the intersection of consumer behavior and technological change, is at the precipice of a new wave of innovation. Fueled by RSS, followed by the adoption of AirPods, smart speakers, and more, the demand for audio in the form of podcasts and audiobooks is at an all time high. That, in turn, makes entrepreneurs more adventurous in advancing new social and user-generated methods of creating audio content. The next decade of innovation of audio will likely be as productive and valuable that of messaging, video, and other media to date. Audio will create </span><a href=\"https://a16z.com/2020/12/07/social-strikes-back-fastest-growing-apps\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">the next generation of startups</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> in social networking, social content platforms, and publishing, and will be embedded into a wide variety of products and services. Follow the innovation\u00e2\u0080\u0094listen closely.</span></p>\n<div class=\"download-cta\"><div class=\"inner\"><h2>Everything you thought you knew about social networks is getting reinvented.</h2><p>Our new series, Social Strikes Back, explores the hyper-social future of consumer tech.</p><a class=\"btn btn-orange\" href=\"https://a16z.com/social-strikes-back\">See more</a></div></div>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\">***</p>\n<p><em>The views expressed here are those of the individual AH Capital Management, L.L.C.

One of the biggest dimensions of evolution in digital health, arguably, over the last few years has been how companies are actually coming to market, how new products and services are being distributed to end users, and how these products and services are getting monetized.</p>\n<p>As a founder who started a company over 10 years ago at this point, the sheer number and level of sophistication with which digital health companies are coming to market is just completely mind blowing.</p>\n<p>Some of the examples that we\u2019re going to cover in later playbooks include: selling to SMBs, two-sided networks, risk-based contracting with payors, and the emergence of new channel distribution platforms. But in this current session we\u2019re going to cover this concept of B2C2B, or what you might call the bottom up, top down sales motion.</p>\n<h3><div data-toc-header=\"What is B2C2B?\" id=\"section--1\"></div>What is B2C2B?</h3>\n<p><strong>Julie: </strong>This is the healthcare version of a trend that we\u2019ve seen play out in B2B software. You might think about Slack or Zoom or Dropbox, or these products that you as an individual user can obviously adopt.</p>\n<p>But what these companies are then doing is saying, now there\u2019s a critical mass of these users and they might all work for the same company. Let\u2019s actually parlay that bottom up motion into an enterprise sale to that company, and also potentially introduce more advanced features that are more enterprise grade. And that\u2019s really the motion that we\u2019re seeing play out in healthcare.</p>\n<p>I\u2019ll pass it off to Jay. Jay, can you walk us through why we\u2019re seeing this now in healthcare when we didn\u2019t really see a lot of this kind of activity in the past?</p>\n<h3><div data-toc-header=\"Why now?\" id=\"section--2\"></div>Why are we seeing B2C2B now?</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/4-trends.jpg?ssl=1\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-309128\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"405\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/4-trends.jpg?resize=720%2C405&amp;ssl=1\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/4-trends.jpg?w=720&amp;ssl=1 720w, https://i2.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/4-trends.jpg?resize=300%2C169&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/4-trends.jpg?resize=125%2C70&amp;ssl=1 125w, https://i2.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/4-trends.jpg?resize=587%2C330&amp;ssl=1 587w\" width=\"720\"/></a></p>\n<p><strong>Jay: </strong>We\u2019re seeing digital health companies sell directly to the end user before going to the enterprise buyer with increasing frequency. And there\u2019s probably a number of reasons that are driving that trend, but there\u2019s at least four that I think we should call out \u2014 two on the consumer side and two on the enterprise side.</p>\n<p>On the consumer side, there is an increasingly tech forward consumer and end user driving health care purchasing. We all are delighted by our technology enabled experiences in other parts of our lives. We get to call a car, order food, purchase clothes, pay a friend all with a tap and a swipe on our phone. And so we expect intuitive virtual first experiences in our healthcare system, especially after the work from home life we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve adopted in 2020 and 2021.</p>\n<p>These same consumers have far more discretion over and are steering a lot more of the healthcare spend themselves. There is <a href=\"https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/payer/nationwide-out-pocket-spending-grew-10-to-1-650-per-person-2021-expect-to-continue-through\">a recent report</a> estimating nationwide out-of-pocket spending on healthcare (i.e., not reimbursed by insurance) is set to hit almost $500B in the U.S. in 2021 and projected to grow to about $800B by 2026.</p>\n<p>And then on the enterprise side, we frequently hear from many senior enterprise buyers (chief information officers, chief human resource officers, and other executives) about the record number of vendors pitching them new digital health solutions. This vendor fatigue is leading to a bottleneck. As a result, there are many promising B2B digital health solutions out there that don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t make it through the purchasing funnel.</p>\n<p>And that third trend seemingly coincides with a fourth, which is a rising bar for validation. Enterprise buyers in healthcare and life sciences increasingly expect evidence that the solution works before buying.</p>\n<p>For digital health startups, this creates a chicken and egg problem: how do you prove ROI without people using your product? B2C2B makes it possible to go to the enterprise and say, \u00e2\u0080\u009cHey, a hundred or a thousand of your employees, your members, your constituents are already using this offering and are getting value out of it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d</p>\n<h3>The 8 Questions we asked founders</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Digital-Health-Builders-Video-Graphics-R3.png?ssl=1\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-317804\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"1080\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Digital-Health-Builders-Video-Graphics-R3.png?resize=1920%2C1080&amp;ssl=1\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Digital-Health-Builders-Video-Graphics-R3.png?w=1920&amp;ssl=1 1920w, https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Digital-Health-Builders-Video-Graphics-R3.png?resize=300%2C169&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Digital-Health-Builders-Video-Graphics-R3.png?resize=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Digital-Health-Builders-Video-Graphics-R3.png?resize=768%2C432&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Digital-Health-Builders-Video-Graphics-R3.png?resize=1536%2C864&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Digital-Health-Builders-Video-Graphics-R3.png?resize=1120%2C630&amp;ssl=1 1120w, https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Digital-Health-Builders-Video-Graphics-R3.png?resize=125%2C70&amp;ssl=1 125w, https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Digital-Health-Builders-Video-Graphics-R3.png?resize=740%2C416&amp;ssl=1 740w, https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Digital-Health-Builders-Video-Graphics-R3.png?resize=587%2C330&amp;ssl=1 587w\" width=\"1920\"/></a></p>\n<p><strong>Jay: </strong>We\u2019ve seen B2C2B work across a number of areas, including care navigation, women\u2019s health, behavioral health, and many more. In fact, there are a lot of different flavors of B2C2B, and when we talk about consumers and end users, we could be talking about patients, employees, clinicians, or medical researchers. When we talk about businesses, we could be talking about employers, providers, payors, or life sciences organizations.</p>\n<p>And while we as investors see B2C2B as a significant trend, we are fortunate in our jobs to meet and work with some of the best digital health companies today. So we interviewed founders and builders from some of those companies to ask the toughest questions that come up for B2C2B digital health companies:</p>\n<p>How do you acquire consumers? How do you build a product that keeps them engaged? How do you price the consumer product? When is it time to go B2B? How do you find your business buyer and PMF with the enterprise? How do you actually sell to the enterprise? How do you balance two motions, one to the consumer and one to the business, at scale? What\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the role of professional services? But we started our interviews with the most basic question. Given the complexity of B2C2B, why are founders going this way instead of sticking to a more traditional and tried-and-true commercial motion?</p>\n<h3><div data-toc-header=\"Why go B2C2B?\" id=\"section--3\"></div>Why choose B2C2B?</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Digital-Health-Builders-GTM-4.jpg?ssl=1\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-309146\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"576\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Digital-Health-Builders-GTM-4.jpg?resize=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Digital-Health-Builders-GTM-4.jpg?resize=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Digital-Health-Builders-GTM-4.jpg?resize=300%2C169&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Digital-Health-Builders-GTM-4.jpg?resize=768%2C432&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Digital-Health-Builders-GTM-4.jpg?resize=1536%2C864&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Digital-Health-Builders-GTM-4.jpg?resize=1120%2C630&amp;ssl=1 1120w, https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Digital-Health-Builders-GTM-4.jpg?resize=125%2C70&amp;ssl=1 125w, https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Digital-Health-Builders-GTM-4.jpg?resize=740%2C416&amp;ssl=1 740w, https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Digital-Health-Builders-GTM-4.jpg?resize=587%2C330&amp;ssl=1 587w, https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Digital-Health-Builders-GTM-4.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w\" width=\"1024\"/></a></p>\n<p><strong>Jay: </strong>While B2C2B can be more complex to execute, it gives startups the power to acquire and engage users directly without first contracting with the payor, as we heard from serial digital health entrepreneur Chris Hogg, whose most recent startup Marley Medical is developing a virtual first clinic for patients with poorly managed disease. In Marley\u00e2\u0080\u0099s case, the consumers are people diagnosed with chronic diseases, and the businesses are the payors that pay for the healthcare services that those folks receive.</p>\n<p><strong>Chris:</strong> I think in order to understand B2C2B, we need to understand the B2B2C motion and why this has taken over. The reason is there were really no other options. If you\u2019re not in the normal classification system, you have to go direct to the payer, who is either the payor or an employer, and contract directly on the product side of the house for a new product.</p>\n<p>Now with virtual care, we are a normal product. It is a normal clinical service. In the eyes of a payor, they know how to pay for these types of services. And so we can invert the model and focus on our growth, focus on patient acquisition in a direct to consumer motion. There\u2019s many ways that you could do that online through referrals or whatever, but control the ability to bring patients in, and then still get paid by payors because now we\u2019re a traditional service. That could look as an in network provider, if you can figure out a code stack that works for you and covers the services. It could be in capitated arrangements, but you\u2019re getting paid on these patients who you\u2019re acquiring directly.</p>\n<p>In a nutshell, the B2C2B motion is trying to control the growth through direct patient acquisition. I can build up my own funnels and channels to acquire patients, but then still get paid by the traditional system of payors and employers.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Digital-Health-Builders-GTM-3.jpg?ssl=1\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-309145\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"260\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Digital-Health-Builders-GTM-3.jpg?resize=1024%2C260&amp;ssl=1\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Digital-Health-Builders-GTM-3.jpg?resize=1024%2C260&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Digital-Health-Builders-GTM-3.jpg?resize=300%2C76&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Digital-Health-Builders-GTM-3.jpg?resize=768%2C195&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Digital-Health-Builders-GTM-3.jpg?resize=1536%2C390&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i2.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Digital-Health-Builders-GTM-3.jpg?resize=125%2C32&amp;ssl=1 125w, https://i2.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Digital-Health-Builders-GTM-3.jpg?resize=590%2C150&amp;ssl=1 590w, https://i2.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Digital-Health-Builders-GTM-3.jpg?resize=1120%2C284&amp;ssl=1 1120w, https://i2.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Digital-Health-Builders-GTM-3.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w\" width=\"1024\"/></a></p>\n<p><strong>Jay:</strong> The power of direct acquisition carries with it a number of benefits. When digital health companies get to engage with their end consumer earlier, the result is often better products and better healthcare.</p>\n<p>Companies reach product-market fit faster because they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re able to iterate and improve the product to keep acquiring users. Get enough of those users, and you can use that as a wedge to sell into businesses. Entering the enterprise with momentum and utilization data can help you shortcut an otherwise long enterprise sales cycle.</p>\n<p>Now the biggest challenge we hear about with B2C2B is that you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re signing yourself up to execute two GTM motions in parallel, with the limited resources of a startup. The upside, though, is that if you achieve high engagement and stickiness in both motions, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re unlocking a more resilient business model with greater long-term defensibility.</p>\n<p>To this end, we heard from Kate, the founder of Maven, a women\u2019s and family health platform and marketplace, that B2C2B can also make it easier to show earlier indications that things are working.</p>\n<p><strong>Kate:</strong> Because investors didn\u2019t really know as much about digital health, you just when you raise money have to show momentum. And so we had to show some kind of momentum at every single fundraise and we needed a certain amount of capital in the early days to build out our product to be operational in all 50 states so that we could sell it into the enterprise.</p>\n<p>We also just needed to show a certain amount of consumer momentum because our story to the investors was, \u201cHey, we\u2019ve launched this new virtual clinic for women\u2019s and family health. Consumers love it, and now we\u2019re taking it into the enterprise.\u201d That was a much better story and showed traction than just, \u201cHey, we have this thesis that this is an important category, and we have two small companies to pilot with. Will you fund us?\u201d</p>\n<h3><div data-toc-header=\"1. How do you acquire users?\" id=\"section--4\"></div>1. How do you acquire users?</h3>\n<p><strong>Jay: </strong>In the early stages, the goal is acquiring users. But how do you find &amp; reach them? A lot of that comes down to what one founder called \u00e2\u0080\u009cconsumer-channel fit.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Different businesses have different end consumers, and if you understand where your specific end users are looking for digital health information \u2014 whether it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s online on Facebook or offline in community gatherings, you can acquire them at a lower cost. For instance, Butterfly generated initial interest for its point of care ultrasound devices by targeting the most influential clinicians.</p>\n<p><strong>Bill:</strong> There are people that are deeply passionate about point of care ultrasound, and so we tapped into that. We looked at who was the most researched. We look at what centers they were in?</p>\n<p>It was, it was, we very carefully targeting them. And then of course we were at the major trade shows back then, and I\u2019ll never forget the first conference I went to at butterfly. You walk around the trade show floor and all the booths were empty. Ours would have a line in every direction.</p>\n<p><strong>Jay:</strong> And in another example of consumer-channel fit, Maven tried Facebook ads, but found they just didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t do well at reaching their target demographic as other channels did.</p>\n<p><strong>Kate:</strong> There\u2019s two things we did. First, giveaway marketing. Giveaway marketing, for those people who don\u2019t know what it is, is when you partner up with a lot of other like-minded brands, you find a prize and you then blast your customer bases to sign up for the prize. Then you get email lists and off the email lists you try to convert people to use your product.</p>\n<p>We did this very early on. It was one of the biggest marketing channels that we went out the door with in 2015. One of our early investors was an early investor in Noma, which is a wonderful restaurant in Copenhagen that everyone wanted to go to. Now that I\u2019m seeing giveaway marketing and what people will sign up for, \u201cit\u2019s oh, here\u2019s a hat.\u201d And then, all these people sign up to win a hat. We offered an all expenses paid trip to Noma in Copenhagen. It was awesome. And then we went out to all these consumer brands. We launched it, and then we got something like 20,000 emails of women from like-minded brands that we could go market Maven to. It was a lot of work, and we had someone on our team doing this full time, but it was from a cost standpoint pretty cheap.</p>\n<p>Then off the back of that, we would run and pick consumer campaigns to drive engagement in the product. One of our earliest consumer campaigns that was really successful was called therapist speed dating. We cut down our therapy appointments to 10 minute increments, and then we would offer free therapist speed dating to find a therapist for you to then book your therapy appointment. We would get the emails from these giveaways and then we would go drive this offer and campaign into our product that was just ours, and we started to get consumer volume off the back of some of this.</p>\n<p>That was one motion. The other motion was, honestly, we just did field marketing.</p>\n<h3><div data-toc-header=\"2. How do you build an engaging consumer product?\" id=\"section--5\"></div>2. How do you build an engaging consumer product?</h3>\n<p><strong>Jay:\u00c2\u00a0 </strong>Of course, acquiring users only works if they stay engaged, and that comes down to building a product that actually meets their needs, while also preparing for the complexities that come with scaling a digital health product.</p>\n<p><strong>Chris:</strong> The key challenge is to not build a product that you think people are going to need and use, but to really work backwards from the problem. I think one of the challenges that folks got into with B2B2C is that isn\u2019t so acute. You\u2019re able to build something that you can pitch well to buyers, but it might not be something that fits a problem that actual patients and users need to solve.</p>\n<p>Especially with a direct to consumer acquisition approach, you have to try to break it down. What is a small unit that I could try to sell to this person or try to acquire them into? Because what you\u2019re trying to do is prove there\u2019s demand, prove that people want this product, or at least are willing to engage with it and then build it out over time.</p>\n<p>Of course, the big challenge with healthcare versus a pure consumer product is that this is healthcare. This is health data. This is very meaningful stuff, and there is a minimum chassis that you need to do that. You can\u2019t just throw out medical recommendations and see if they land.</p>\n<p>The challenge is finding that balance of building something really small and atomic, but building it well, so that you\u2019re a mini HIPAA compliant platform. Even if you\u2019re just bringing people in online and HIPAA doesn\u2019t apply to you, you\u2019re already thinking about how you\u2019re managing people\u2019s data.</p>\n<p><strong>Jay:</strong> We heard something similar from Saji at Benchling, an informatics platform for life sciences researchers. They started by giving away the product to academic researchers and then staying close to their early users to iterate on the product.</p>\n<p><strong>Saji:</strong> You need to build for a very small group that you can then logically expand pretty easily. If we can get one academic lab being really successful in, let\u2019s say, doing molecular biology research, why can\u2019t we get a second? Why can we get a third? And so rather than trying to go broad, we were just very narrow and pointed, but the space we were in had a lot of room for expansion. That\u2019s kind of how we thought about it.</p>\n<p>If ten people or a hundred people were totally addicted to the software, that was a really good sign because what are the chances that we found just the exact hundred people who\u2019d be completed addicted and then there\u2019d been no one else after that? So I\u2019d preach more focus in the early days for most of those companies.</p>\n<h3><strong><div data-toc-header=\"3. How do you price for consumer? \" id=\"section--6\"></div>3.

Almost no founder we spoke thought they perfected pricing. There are a variety of models, but you\u2019re really balancing two trade-offs \u2014 the budgets you go after and the pricing structure you offer.</p>\n<p>On budgets, you can simply do a cash pay model where you have end consumers pay, or you can allow for reimbursement where the insurer, the employer, and so forth covers part or all of it. Cash pay naturally has less friction for the buyer, but that also may limit you on how much you can charge overall. And you may run into confusion as different consumers have different expectations for who covers their digital health services.</p>\n<p><strong>Kate:</strong> Even though some of our early marketing was Maven is cheaper than the price of a copay. There was a lot of consumer confusion still around, \u201cwait, shouldn\u2019t my insurance pay for this?\u201d When it became a more transactional, like I just need a prescription for something, then it was more straightforward because you were getting something physically. But when it was a service, it was harder to understand why your insurance wouldn\u2019t pay for it, even if you hit people over the head with the logic of, but it\u2019s cheaper than what your insurance even has.</p>\n<p><strong>Jay:</strong> If you choose a cash pay model for the end user, how do you set the right price? Here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s how Butterfly did it for their point of care ultrasound device.</p>\n<p><strong>Bill:</strong> The view, first of all, is it had to be very affordable. It had to be at a price point where clinicians would just put in their credit card and then also could be afforded by many parts of the world. Jonathan, our founder, really just decided $2,000 is the price and made everyone else figure out how to get there. And I think it was the gut feeling that $2,000 was that right price point that they could get the consumer, in this case the clinician, to put in their credit card.</p>\n<p><strong>Jay:</strong> The second tradeoff is around how you structure your pricing, whether you price for usage or in a bundled offer. If you do usage-based pricing, that might seem more fair: you pay for what you use. But you may discourage usage and, more importantly, the user feedback that is super informative to your early product development.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, you can structure your pricing in a subscription, such as a monthly fee. That may allow for a more natural usage pattern \u2014 customers can use as much as they want for a fixed fee \u2014 but it does add more friction for the initial purchase.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, in B2C, you are pricing for engagement more than revenue. But as we heard from Amanda at Bold, which develops fitness programs for seniors aging in place, what you do in B2C has implications for your B2B pricing.</p>\n<p><strong>Amanda:</strong> We were actually less fixated, candidly, on the B2C pricing strategy. It was what is the potential ROI story that we can tell on the B2B side, and then on B2C we really privileged engagement. We did pricing experiments, and that was great, but I would say, be mindful of whatever you put out as your B2C pricing, because you will have to explain the difference between B2C and B2C2B.</p>\n<p><strong>Jay:</strong> When it comes to B2B pricing, we heard from founders that most business buyers preferred simplicity, but that really it was a matter of aligning incentives with the business you were selling into. For instance, payors are used to a per member per month [PMPM] model, so that tends to be their preference, while most employers would rather have the simplicity of an annual license.</p>\n<h3><div data-toc-header=\"4. When do you go B2B?\" id=\"section--7\"></div>4. When do you go B2B?</h3>\n<p><strong>Jay:</strong> But stepping back from pricing, the bigger question is when should you flip the switch and go B2B? We generally recommend turning on enterprise when you see repeatable usage patterns among a core customer group through concrete data gathering. Several digital health founders have told us that their enterprise buyers basically expected them to have run a randomized controlled trial demonstrating the ROI before signing a partnership.</p>\n<p><strong>Amanda:</strong> We launched our research study at the same time that we launched our DTC [direct-to-consumer] offering. The moment that we had our six month outcomes, and we looked at what the six month outcomes were as far as reduction in annualized fall rates and improvement in balance and strength and mobility, that was for me the moment that I felt really excited and confident to take that story and that offering to enterprise customers. We felt like we were sufficiently de-risked in the eyes of someone who would be excited to be innovative, but wants to know this isn\u2019t a total sort of shot in the dark. The hard data from that research study also allowed us to think about what is the ROI and over what time period.</p>\n<p>I think another way to do it \u2014 and I get this question a lot \u2014 is volume. Maybe you haven\u2019t done a research study, but you have really big volume and you can start collecting that data and saying I already have this existing base of individuals. I think that\u2019s another way to position and share impact when you\u2019re having B2B conversations.</p>\n<h3><div data-toc-header=\"5. How do you find your B2B buyer and PMF?\" id=\"section--8\"></div>5. How do you find your B2B buyer and PMF?</h3>\n<p><strong>Jay:</strong> Once you go B2B, you have a headstart from the B2C motion, but you still have to figure out how your end consumer connects to a business buyer. At Benchling, they followed their academic users into life science companies.</p>\n<p><strong>Saji:</strong> You had these brand new companies oftentimes being spun out of academic labs that used Benchling that were doing breathtaking things: gene editing medicine, lab-grown meats, you name it. Some of the scientists who used Benchling for free in schools started to go over there, and then we just followed them and followed the user.</p>\n<p>Actually though, at first, we really struck out trying to sell anything to these companies. Scientists had used Benchling in school, and they liked it, but they weren\u2019t going to buy it. The business value wasn\u2019t there.</p>\n<p>That\u2019s when Benchling really started to grow. It went from a productivity suite for end users to building the single source of truth for the business, and the end user experience was what enabled us to get the data to then present back to the business, like here\u2019s all your scientific data in one place, highly organized and structured.</p>\n<p><strong>Jay:</strong> For Benchling reaching an enterprise buyer meant evolving their product offering to meet the more complex needs of an enterprise organization. Similarly, Butterfly overcame the resistance of hospitals to allow clinicians to use a third-party device, even one those clinicians paid for themselves, by creating additional enterprise features.</p>\n<p><strong>Bill:</strong> We knew their concerns around security and governance and integration, and so we built a software package for that. That then created the right dynamic, where we actually had a product to sell, which had higher recurring SaaS dollars attached to it. It was a win-win from that perspective: we could solve the clinicians problem of wanting to use it in the hospital, and then we\u2019re driving increased subscription revenue and deepening our tentacles in terms of the integration into the organization and spanning across the organization to do more.</p>\n<h3><div data-toc-header=\"6. How do you sell B2B?\" id=\"section--9\"></div>6. How do you sell B2B?</h3>\n<p><strong>Jay:</strong> So far, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve heard that the timing of when you go B2B comes down to having an ROI case and a sufficient volume of users. And then you have to find your enterprise buyer and layer in the additional product features they care about. But once you are in front of that buyer, how do you actually sell?</p>\n<p><strong>Bill:</strong> One of the things I deeply believe is that people and organizations buy with their heart and rationalize with their brain. That storytelling about what this device can enable using it at scale and how it\u2019s integrated into care and to care pathways is why people are buying it. You then just simply need to justify the ROI on the backend as to why that makes sense for an organization. Health systems have thin margins. They can\u2019t be investing in things that don\u2019t have some sort of ROI, or at least a breakeven. You have to create your price, but the storytelling is much more important, and then the price just has to be justifiable at the end of the day.</p>\n<p><strong>Jay:</strong> Throughout the conversations with founders who have successfully gone B2C2B, we heard about the importance of never losing focus on the end user. Even when you are selling to enterprise, end user product engagement is your advantage. Here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Andrew Le, founder of Buoy Health, explaining why even as a B2B company user engagement is the most important metric.</p>\n<p><strong>Andrew:</strong> The fact that people use something, anything is the most important metric of success for the buyer. Which leads me to that evolution back to the consumer. Why would someone want to use something? Because it\u2019s super useful to them. That\u2019s it.</p>\n<p>When you think about selling to the employer space, our head of people wasn\u2019t buying stuff for Buoy looking at a calculator and being like, \u201chow much money did I save on email this week because I bought Slack?\u201d They weren\u2019t saying, \u201chow many times did I not have to keep an Excel sheet updated, or get people to log on to Excel and how much time and effort that would take, but instead people logged into Namely. They\u2019re not doing that kind of calculus. They\u2019re just looking at how many people are using Namely or how many people are using Slack or how many people are using insert service, benefit, product, whatever it may be.</p>\n<p>For us, the reason it circles back around to the consumer was like, \u201cshoot, we should just care about being super, super useful to the consumer, to the end user.\u201d That\u2019s all that matters. And playing with the numbers or playing with different ways of measuring ROI is in and of itself a red herring.</p>\n<h3><div data-toc-header=\"7. How do you balance two GTMs at scale?\" id=\"section--10\"></div>7. How do you balance two GTMs at scale?</h3>\n<p><strong>Jay:</strong> Once you\u2019ve gone to the enterprise, a company is effectively executing two go to market motions at once. It can almost create this schizophrenic pressure. How do companies in the later stages balance the needs of the consumer with the needs of the enterprise? Like Andrew at Buoy, for Amanda at Bold, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s about always coming back to the end user.</p>\n<p><strong>Amanda:</strong> There\u2019s absolutely considerations. Are you integrating with Epic? Can you collect this additional information that we\u2019re going to need to verify that they\u2019re eligible through their health plan? Honestly, when we add those pieces in, I think about we establish the best practice and then we start to see how implementation can actually pull us away from what we believe our high bar standard should be. Then, we rally the team to say, okay, how do we tick off the needs that our enterprise customer requires? And we absolutely will do that, but then pull ourselves back up so that we aren\u2019t allowing the default to be this perhaps lower engagement, higher friction experience and incrementally improve.</p>\n<p>That has been really helpful for our product team, as far as understanding there\u2019s going to be some deviations, we have to keep experimenting. But we know what\u2019s possible, so let\u2019s get back to that maximally engaging experience.</p>\n<p><strong>Jay:</strong> While focus on the end user is important, you also have to manage enterprise expectations. Otherwise your product team can end up pulled in too many directions.</p>\n<p><strong>Bill:</strong> It\u2019s the age old problem of going into the enterprise because you\u2019re talking to a leader of a really important health system that could be your first reference account and they\u2019re demanding some feature or capability, it\u2019s easy to make the mistake of over promising. What I\u2019ve learned on the commercial side is tell your product and engineering people to be conservative, start there. Whatever they give you to be conservative, add a quarter to it.</p>\n<h3><div data-toc-header=\"8. What's the role of professional services?\" id=\"section--11\"></div>8. What\u2019s the role of professional services?</h3>\n<p><strong>Jay:</strong> Once you have sold into the enterprise and are now managing two go-to-market motions in parallel, professional services can play an integral role in making these more complex customers successful using your product.</p>\n<p><strong>Saji:</strong> Big organizations need help. They\u2019re so large that they need extra support to make changes and who better to know how to implement your product than you. Those are your people who know your product, and they\u2019re going to bring back that knowledge to your R&amp;D teams and help make the product better.</p>\n<p>Adding promotional services was an incredibly important business decision for us. Now you need to make sure that you\u2019re not using professional services as a band-aid to cover for bad product or to avoid building product in certain areas, or to have to customize the software. A big part of the thesis behind Benchling was that we could build something that was highly configurable, so it could be applied to different scientific use cases, but didn\u2019t require a bunch of programming for our different customers, who are stuck in some customization hell, so we heavily employ services. We sell services with every deal we do. It doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re a tiny startup, and it\u2019s a very fixed quickstart package kind of thing, a couple of hours. If you\u2019re a giant enterprise moving everyone to Benchling, we may be doing services with you for 18 months across 2000 people in 20 sites. The customers, the enterprise ones especially, want to know not only are they buying the software, but services are a guarantee that they\u2019re gonna be successful with the software.</p>\n<p><strong>Jay:</strong> Okay, so we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve heard from founders about the journey from the early days of engaging your first users to balancing two motions at scale. And perhaps most exciting in all of this is that B2C2B keeps those who build digital health products close to the end users who need them.</p>\n<p>At a16z, we are incredibly excited about the potential of this approach to improve healthcare and lower costs. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll pass it back now to Julie to share our perspective on what our team pays most attention to as investors.</p>\n<h3><div data-toc-header=\"Investor perspective\" id=\"section--12\"></div>Investor perspective: what we look for in potential investments</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Digital-Health-Builders-GTM-1.jpg?ssl=1\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-309143\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"576\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Digital-Health-Builders-GTM-1.jpg?resize=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Digital-Health-Builders-GTM-1.jpg?resize=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Digital-Health-Builders-GTM-1.jpg?resize=300%2C169&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Digital-Health-Builders-GTM-1.jpg?resize=768%2C432&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Digital-Health-Builders-GTM-1.jpg?resize=1536%2C864&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i2.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Digital-Health-Builders-GTM-1.jpg?resize=1120%2C630&amp;ssl=1 1120w, https://i2.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Digital-Health-Builders-GTM-1.jpg?resize=125%2C70&amp;ssl=1 125w, https://i2.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Digital-Health-Builders-GTM-1.jpg?resize=740%2C416&amp;ssl=1 740w, https://i2.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Digital-Health-Builders-GTM-1.jpg?resize=587%2C330&amp;ssl=1 587w, https://i2.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Digital-Health-Builders-GTM-1.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w\" width=\"1024\"/></a></p>\n<p><strong>Julie:</strong> So we wanted to just share a few things about what we would look for in evaluating investment opportunities. There\u2019s really three major pillars to that. One would be focused on the C part of the motion. Really at the earliest stages, we\u2019re looking for B2C traction, and it largely looks the way that you would evaluate any B2C business. You\u2019ll look at the cohorts. You look at adoption, retention, stickiness. You look at marketing efficiency \u2014 your CAC [customer acquisition costs] versus your projected LTV [lifetime value].</p>\n<p>This is really where compared to a B2B2C motion or even just a straight B2B motion, you would really expect to see far more user data and validation earlier in the trajectory of that business than you would otherwise.</p>\n<p>The other thing to point out on the C side is really product velocity. One of the benefits, as we mentioned earlier, of doing the B2C motion to begin with is the ability to have much higher speed of iteration on your actual product. That is certainly something that we would qualitatively look at as well. So, that\u2019s pillar one.</p>\n<p>Pillar two would really be around the B. When you\u2019re looking at a seed or even a series A stage company, there might be less quantitative data to look at on this front. Here we\u2019ll look for just the early validation. How many cycles have you spent on the enterprise side? Do you actually have a pipeline of enterprise logos and an ability to really tell that enterprise story in a reasonably compelling and articulate way? Certainly bonus points if you actually have a contract with an enterprise buyer and have actually gone live with an enterprise.</p>\n<p>And then the final pillar that we generally look for is: does your financing plan and your actual company build plan appropriately accommodate the fact that you will be investing in essentially two motions in parallel? As we mentioned before, B2C2B sounds great, but it actually is quite a bit of work to build a consumer muscle at the same time as building that enterprise muscle. And so we just want to make sure that founders fully appreciate that.</p>\n<p>So in closing, thank you for joining us for this first in a series of digital health go to market playbooks.

Even today, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hard to conceive of pressing human problems that can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be solved primarily through more cooperation\u00e2\u0080\u0094cooperation between people who might reside across political divides, speak different languages, and adhere to fundamentally different ideologies. So much of what we have built, our greatest successes as a species\u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00e2\u0080\u0093like the Internet or space travel\u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00e2\u0080\u0093have been efforts that are truly global. But how is this scale of cooperation even possible?</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-296457 size-large\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"576\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/S18_AYahya-1.003.jpeg?resize=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1\" width=\"1024\"/></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">It is all driven by trust. Trust is an elusive concept. It is a word that we use a lot, but what does it actually mean? When you boil it down, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a certain kind of confidence that doing something or interacting with someone is likely to go well for you.</span></p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-296459 size-large\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"576\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/S18_AYahya-1.004.jpeg?resize=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1\" width=\"1024\"/></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Throughout history, the kinds of things that we have relied on to build trust have changed dramatically. We started as nomadic hunter gatherers, basing our trust on things like facial expressions and body language\u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00e2\u0080\u0093the biological signals that we instinctively cue into when we interact with one another. This model of trust was Social.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-296460 size-large\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"576\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/S18_AYahya-1.005.jpeg?resize=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1\" width=\"1024\"/></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Over the many millennia that have followed, human institutions\u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00e2\u0080\u0093like churches, schools, local governments, and then nation states, and corporations\u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00e2\u0080\u0093have come along, and they have gone a long way to help us scale trust from the very local, where everyone knows one another intimately, to the nearly global, where everyone is a stranger. Let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s call this model of trust Institutional. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the predominant model of trust today.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">But we are now reaching the limits of purely Institutional trust. It is too often the case that the institutions that we place our trust in let us down. Think of the recent Wells Fargo scandal, or of the Equifax hack, or the ongoing saga about user data over at Facebook, or\u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00e2\u0080\u0093for that matter\u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00e2\u0080\u0093of the Great Financial crisis ten years ago. Say what you will about crypto, but I think you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll agree with me, there is a lot of room for improvement.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Our technology, and especially our software, has been </span><b>immeasurably</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> successful at improving a lot of things. But it has only begun to </span><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">scratch the surface</span></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> of the world of trust. I will argue that since the creation of the Internet, we have begun to discover a new paradigm for trust.</span></p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-296461 size-large\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"576\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/S18_AYahya-1.006-1.jpeg?resize=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1\" width=\"1024\"/></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">It is a kind of trust that is </span><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">programmable</span></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. It is enabled by software, and its guarantees are based on something more fundamental than the authority of a human institution. To explain what this means and how it works, I need to take a moment to break down trust further into its elemental building blocks.\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-296462 size-large\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"576\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/S18_AYahya-1.007.jpeg?resize=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1\" width=\"1024\"/></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">There are really two important components of trust. Two elements that together combine to form all of our trust in people\u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00e2\u0080\u0093be it individuals or institutions\u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00e2\u0080\u0093and our trust in technology.\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The first is biological and instinctive \u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00e2\u0080\u0093 the social elements of our interactions. We trust certain facial expressions, we trust perceived social status, we trust brand and reputation, and we trust observed track record. This kind of trust is of course hard to scale because it takes time and direct human exposure to build.\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The second component comes from our knowledge of the physical world. It comes from our understanding of things like Math &amp; Physics. It is the kind of trust that gives us confidence that doing something like landing on the moon is even possible.\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-296463 size-large\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"576\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/S18_AYahya-1.008.jpeg?resize=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1\" width=\"1024\"/></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">These two components can be used as building blocks for a third component. A third building block that we can use to create trust\u2013and that is Incentive Structures.</span></p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-296464 size-large\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"576\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/S18_AYahya-1.009.jpeg?resize=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1\" width=\"1024\"/></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Now, some incentive structures are built primarily from things that are physical \u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00e2\u0080\u0093 things in the orange circle. For example, we tend to trust that the physical difficulty of forging a U.S. dollar bill is enough to disincentivize most people from trying. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just not worth it. And of course, it also happens to be illegal, which itself is a disincentive. But that one looks more like this.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-296465 size-large\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"576\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/S18_AYahya-1.010.jpeg?resize=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1\" width=\"1024\"/></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">It is made up of people. Most of our incentive structures are made up of people\u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00e2\u0080\u0093they are social constructs. Think of our legal contracts, or government regulation, or of insurance. Or think of the many agreements we make all the time implicitly with companies whose Terms of Service aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t exactly written by J.K. Rowling.\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The problem today is that institutions have become the sole gatekeepers of trust. We are strongly dependent on them to cooperate. The best example of this is our financial system.</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h2><b>Financial Institutions as Today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Gatekeepers of Trust</b></h2>\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-296466 size-large\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"576\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/S18_AYahya-1.012.jpeg?resize=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1\" width=\"1024\"/></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In our current financial system, the integrity of any transaction depends on the trustworthiness of the human institution\u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00e2\u0080\u0093a bank\u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00e2\u0080\u0093that sits in the middle of it.</span></p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-296467 size-large\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"576\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/S18_AYahya-1.013.jpeg?resize=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1\" width=\"1024\"/></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">And the only reason we trust banks is: because they have a track record, they have a reputation, and because there are legal incentive structures around them. Take, for example, credit cards. They\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not very secure. But the reason that you are willing to trust them is that, if someone charges something to your card, you can just dispute it after the fact. An entire team of trusted humans will then readily get involved and get you paid back! Our trust in our financial infrastructure today is based, not on technology, but on this human-driven possibility for recourse.</span></p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-296468 size-large\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"576\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/S18_AYahya-1.014.jpeg?resize=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1\" width=\"1024\"/></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">This institutional model of trust works in the first world but it simply cannot scale to 8 billion people. As </span><a href=\"https://a16z.com/author/katie-haun/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Katie Haun</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> mentioned in her talk about </span><a href=\"https://a16z.com/2018/12/14/beyond-silk-road-crypto-use-cases-summit-2018/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">why she got interested in crypto</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, two billion people in the world today are completely unbanked, credit card fraud cost $190B last year, and fewer than 5% of people in the world hold any investments in stocks or government bonds. Now in contrast to this limited system, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d like to give you an example of how trust can work differently.</span></p>\n<h2><b>An Open Source Internet and Trust</b></h2>\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-296469 size-large\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"576\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/S18_AYahya-1.015.jpeg?resize=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1\" width=\"1024\"/></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The Internet is one of our first global systems of cooperation where trust is not primarily based on institutions. Or at least it wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t \u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00e2\u0080\u0093 in the beginning.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-296470 size-large\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"576\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/S18_AYahya-1.016.jpeg?resize=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1\" width=\"1024\"/></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The early protocols of the Internet, let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s call them the protocols of Web 1.0, were a beautiful thing. TCP, IP, SMTP and HTTP \u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00e2\u0080\u0093 they were designed in the 70s and 80s with a spirit of openness and inclusiveness. They were open standards. This means that anyone anywhere has the ability, on equal footing, to build on top of them without anyone\u00e2\u0080\u0099s permission. Case in point, hundreds of open source implementations exist. The code for these protocols inside of your phone right now, whether it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an iPhone or an Android phone, is directly based on open source code.</span></p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-296471 size-large\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"576\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/S18_AYahya-1.017.jpeg?resize=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/S18_AYahya-1.017.jpeg?w=1920&amp;ssl=1 1920w, https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/S18_AYahya-1.017.jpeg?resize=300%2C169&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/S18_AYahya-1.017.jpeg?resize=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/S18_AYahya-1.017.jpeg?resize=768%2C432&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/S18_AYahya-1.017.jpeg?resize=1536%2C864&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/S18_AYahya-1.017.jpeg?resize=1120%2C630&amp;ssl=1 1120w, https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/S18_AYahya-1.017.jpeg?resize=125%2C70&amp;ssl=1 125w, https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/S18_AYahya-1.017.jpeg?resize=740%2C416&amp;ssl=1 740w, https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/S18_AYahya-1.017.jpeg?resize=587%2C330&amp;ssl=1 587w\" width=\"1024\"/></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Think about this: It is a great feat of human trust and cooperation that today there exists a single, global Internet rather than numerous, disjoint networks that fracture along our many divides. Hundreds of countries and thousands of companies around the world, many with conflicting incentives, have magically converged on running exactly the same protocols, down to the last bit, to be able to connect with one another.</span></p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-296472 size-large\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"576\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/S18_AYahya-1.018.jpeg?resize=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1\" width=\"1024\"/></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In a perennially polarized world, how can we possibly explain this? It was directly a consequence of open source. Because the core protocols of the Internet were open source, nobody could take unilateral control over them. Their emergence and support was bottom up and mostly neutral. They became the stable and level playing field on top of which the ecosystem of the Internet could be built.</span></p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-296473 size-large\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"576\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/S18_AYahya-1.019.jpeg?resize=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1\" width=\"1024\"/></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Their emergence led to a golden period for innovation. Entrepreneurs and their investors could trust that the rules of the game would remain neutral and fair. But, of course, </span><a href=\"https://a16z.com/2019/10/04/commercializing-open-source/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">open source is hard to monetize</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, so the business model of these startups depended on building proprietary, closed protocols on top of the Internet\u00e2\u0080\u0099s open ones. These were the protocols of Web 2.0.</span></p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-296474 size-large\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"576\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/S18_AYahya-1.021.jpeg?resize=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1\" width=\"1024\"/></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">A handful of these startups have since become some of the most valuable companies in human history. You may have heard of some of them. And, of course, thanks to these companies, billions of people have gotten access to great new technologies, mainly for free. And that has been a truly phenomenal thing.

Let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s talk about crypto. This entire presentation can be summarized with a single big idea:</span><b> Cryptonetworks</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Cryptonetworks are a technology with the potential to catalyze trust and therefore cooperation at unprecedented scale.

Now, when you hear \u00e2\u0080\u009ccryptography\u00e2\u0080\u009d you might be tempted to think about encryption, about keeping things secret. But, by far the most important application of cryptography today has nothing to do with secrecy. Instead, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s about making data tamper-proof. Digital signatures, for example, are a breakthrough of modern cryptography that allows me to send you a message that you can be certain\u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00e2\u0080\u0093</span><b>mathematically</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00e2\u0080\u0093really came from me.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-296482 size-large\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"576\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/S18_AYahya-1.029.jpeg?resize=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1\" width=\"1024\"/></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Digital signatures plus the open protocols of Web 1.0 are a powerful combination, and they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve gone a long way to making today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Internet possible. But, they are not a complete set of Lego building blocks for them to serve as a true software platform. There are protocols that are missing. They don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t help with the storage of data, for example. Or with computation on top of that data.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The tech giants of web 2.0 built </span><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">fantastic</span></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> businesses by stepping in and providing closed source versions of those missing protocols.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-296483 size-large\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"576\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/S18_AYahya-1.031.jpeg?resize=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1\" width=\"1024\"/></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">But what we need is a set of protocols that are open\u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00e2\u0080\u0093like the protocols of web 1.0\u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00e2\u0080\u0093that together make for a shared repository of user data (a database) that is neutral and is owned collectively by the users themselves. This means that no one human institution would be in control of it.\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Now, of course, building such a database is hard because someone has to do the work of keeping it honest. Traditionally, we have relied on intermediaries like the tech giants, as well as banks and governments to keep our databases secure for us. What we want instead is for trust in the database to be based on Math and Physics. In other words, it must be self-policing.</span></p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-296484 size-large\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"576\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/S18_AYahya-1.032.jpeg?resize=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1\" width=\"1024\"/></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Almost exactly ten years ago, the Bitcoin paper was published.\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-296485 size-large\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"576\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/S18_AYahya-1.033.jpeg?resize=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1\" width=\"1024\"/></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The idea behind Bitcoin is to leverage the primitives of cryptography like digital signatures, the open protocols of web 1.0, and a very clever incentive structure to build a collectively owned and neutral database of Bitcoin transactions\u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00e2\u0080\u0093of payments.</span></p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-296486 size-large\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"576\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/S18_AYahya-1.034.jpeg?resize=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1\" width=\"1024\"/></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Now, what is truly novel about this database is that its security emerges bottom up from its users \u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00c2\u00a0users who can be anyone, anywhere, and can participate without anyone\u00e2\u0080\u0099s permission.

The challenge is, of course, that many of those participants are no doubt dishonest and they would rather like to game the system for a profit, if they could. The genius of Bitcoin is an incentive structure that makes it self-policing.

The twist is that they vote with their computational power. Consider Alice \u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00c2\u00a0she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a miner.

And as a result, the protocol gives more voting power and a bigger reward.\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Crucially, the reward that is paid out to Alice is newly minted Bitcoin. So in a single stroke, Bitcoin comes alive as a kind of money and, at the same time, as the very source of funding that bootstraps its own security.</span></p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-296491 size-large\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"576\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/S18_AYahya-1.037.jpeg?resize=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1\" width=\"1024\"/></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">This idea is known as Proof-of-Work.\u00c2\u00a0 The insight is that you have to contribute to the security of the database in order to get to vote, and to get paid.

One Dai is always worth $1. This is what Maker is building. The beauty of Dai as a cryptocurrency is that it has all of the advantages offered by Bitcoin, but it is also price stable. Because of its stability, it has a real chance to become a digital alternative to fiat for the two billion people who are unbanked or the hundreds of millions of people in countries with hyperinflation. Maker launched Dai almost a year ago. It has been in circulation ever since, and it has been successful at maintaining its peg. Now, you might think this whole idea should impossible. I mean, the price of something is </span><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">always</span></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> decided by the market, right? But the idea behind Dai is clever.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">How so? Dai is simply a program running on the Ethereum world computer. It mints new Dai tokens and gives them out as loans to whomever is willing to post enough collateral. The collateral is in the form of other crypto-assets for those loans. These newly minted Dai tokens can then be traded as if they were dollars. This is sound because they are fully backed by the collateral that is held by the program. But, of course, we have an obvious problem here: What happens if the value of the Bob\u00e2\u0080\u0099s collateral starts to go down? This is where the magic of software kicks in. As soon as Bob\u2019s loan becomes too risky, the program has the ability to immediately take possession of the collateral, sell it for the Dai that is owed, and use that Dai close Bob\u2019s loan. This takes the Dai out of circulation and ensures that there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s always enough collateral held by the program to back all of the Dai that is outstanding.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Now take a second to think about this. Dai is not just a price-stable cryptocurrency. It is also a lending platform where loans are originated and margin-called entirely in software without trusted human intermediaries \u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00c2\u00a0no banks. Now I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know about you, but I think this is really cool. The glimpses that things like Dai offer of the future are really what get me out of bed and into work every day.</span></p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-296500 size-large\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"576\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/S18_AYahya-1.046.jpeg?resize=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1\" width=\"1024\"/></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s take the idea of lending further. Compound is a company that has built a program that runs on the Ethereum world computer that acts as a kind of money market. Anyone can lend crypto assets to the program, and the program will then, in turn, lend out those crypto assets to others. The interest rate is algorithmically set, and again, no trust is placed on human intermediaries.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Now think of what you could do if were to combine Compound with Dai, as a stable currency to lend and borrow, and were to add a friendly user interface. This starts to look a lot like a consumer bank. But one that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s built entirely in software, end-to-end.</span></p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-296501 size-large\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"576\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/S18_AYahya-1.047.jpeg?resize=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1\" width=\"1024\"/></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s go beyond just finance. What else can we do with programmable trust? One example, is a programmable marketplace like Filecoin. I can rent you the spare storage space on my laptop, and you can pay me for it in Filecoin. Crucially, you and I could be complete strangers and live across the world from another. You can trust that I will store your files, and I can trust that I will get paid for storing your files, because of the mathematical rules and incentives of Filecoin. And again, this works without intermediaries, just the protocol.</span></p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-296502 size-large\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"576\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/S18_AYahya-1.048.jpeg?resize=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1\" width=\"1024\"/></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">This is a CryptoKitty. I happen to own this CryptoKitty. And I also happen to be too embarrassed to admit to you how much I paid for this CryptoKitty. So this CryptoKitty is mine; it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s like some sort of digital, collectible beanie baby or tamagochi (if any of those words mean anything to you).\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The difference here is that this is something that is purely digital that the world recognizes that I own. Think about it: you can use the technology to track how much Bitcoin everyone one. But, you also use it to track who owns all the adorable cats that play starring roles in Pokemon-like online games. I mean, why not? No matter what happens\u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00e2\u0080\u0093even if the company that made CryptoKitties were to go away\u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00e2\u0080\u0093this kitty is still mine. My ownership over it is burned into the Ethereum blockchain. I can take it with me, and into games made by other people. And that is something that is new. This is just the beginning of a new paradigm for web based games.</span></p>\n<h2><b>Cryptonetworks of Web 3.0</b></h2>\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-296503 size-large\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"576\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/S18_AYahya-1.049.jpeg?resize=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1\" width=\"1024\"/></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The technology in this space is still very nascent. This is the very beginning. Countless building blocks are still missing. There are many problems: problems of performance, of privacy which is still missing, of custody and key management, of identity, of protocol governance, and of developer and of user experience. The list goes on, but as these limitations are gradually addressed it will become possible to use this new set of Lego building blocks to build things that we can hardly imagine today\u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00e2\u0080\u0093things as complex as Search Engines and Social Networks that will become platforms in their own right. Like the protocols of Web 1.0, the cryptonetworks of Web 3.0 are open source, collectively owned, and can be trusted to remain neutral.</span></p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-296509 size-large\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"576\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/S18_AYahya-1.050.jpeg?resize=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1\" width=\"1024\"/></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">We see this as the foundation to another wave of innovation that is just as large </span><b>if not larger</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> than the startup ecosystem on the Internet so far.\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">We can hardly hope to imagine what this wave will look like when all is said and done, but we can already see the beginning of a progression: it starts with solutions to some of the inefficiencies in our financial system; it progresses to fully programmable marketplaces like Filecoin; to the first crypto enabled games, like CryptoKitties; and finally to an architecture for the Internet that can serve as a platform for the yet uncharted Web 3.0.</span></p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-296510 size-large\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"576\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/S18_AYahya-1.051.jpeg?resize=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1\" width=\"1024\"/></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">This is a fundamentally new paradigm for computing. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve gone from mainframes, to the personal computer, to the smartphone era, and now onto cryptonetworks. The key feature of this new paradigm that was previously unheard of is that trust can now be software\u2013it is programmable.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-296511 size-large\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"576\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/S18_AYahya-1.052.jpeg?resize=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1\" width=\"1024\"/></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">And, through programmable trust, cryptonetworks stand to enable human cooperation at a scale that is completely unprecedented. Trust is becoming unbundled, decentralized, and inverted \u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00e2\u0080\u0093 instead of flowing top down from institutions to individual people, it is now beginning to emerge bottom up from individuals and software.</span></p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p><i>The views expressed here are those of the individual AH Capital Management, L.L.C.

I\u2019m Rahul. I\u2019m the founder and CEO of Superhuman, where we make the fastest email experience in the world. Our customers get through their inbox twice as fast as before, reply to their important emails sooner, and many see inbox zero for the first time in years.</p>\n<p>Now, Superhuman is productivity software, but I\u2019m really a gamer at heart. And I\u2019m here to share how you can apply game design to business software.</p>\n<p>Today, our business software feels like work. You have to do your email. You have to submit your expense reports. You have to enter data in your CRM. But what if we could make it less like work and more like play? With game design, we can.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Slide1.jpeg?ssl=1\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-297581\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"405\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Slide1.jpeg?resize=720%2C405&amp;ssl=1\" width=\"720\"/></a></p>\n<p>I will shortly share what game design is. But first, let me say what it isn\u2019t. Game design is not gamification. It is not simply taking your product and adding points, levels, trophies, and badges. Ten years ago, gamification was a big deal, but it didn\u2019t work. And to understand why, we have to understand human motivation.</p>\n<p>In the 1970s, Stanford researchers recruited 50 kids, ages 3 to 4. All of these children were previously interested in drawing. Some of the kids were told they would get a reward, a certificate with a gold seal and a ribbon. The other kids weren\u2019t told about a reward. They didn\u2019t even know one existed. The children were then invited into separate rooms to draw for six minutes, and they would either get a reward or not.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Slide2.jpeg?ssl=1\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-297580\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"405\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Slide2.jpeg?resize=720%2C405&amp;ssl=1\" width=\"720\"/></a></p>\n<p>Over the next few days, they were observed to see how much they would continue to draw by themselves. The children who didn\u2019t get a reward spent 17% of their time drawing. But the children who did get a reward only spent 8% of their time drawing. The reward had halved their motivation.</p>\n<p>So, what\u2019s going on here? Well, researchers distinguished intrinsic and extrinsic motivation. With intrinsic motivation, we do things because we find them inherently satisfying and interesting. With extrinsic motivation, we do things to achieve rewards. And that\u2019s the problem with rewards \u00e2\u0080\u0093 they massively undermine intrinsic motivation. This is also why gamification does not work. When gamification appears to work, it is because the underlying experience is already a game.</p>\n<p>That brings us to the question, how do you design a game? This is a question that I have been obsessed with for a long time. As a kid, I learned how to code just so I could make my own games. Before I was a founder, I worked as a game designer. And now as a founder, I\u2019ve gone deep into the theory of game design. As it turns out, there is no unifying theory of game design. To create games, we have to draw upon the art and science of psychology, mathematics, interaction design, and storytelling. These are five factors to consider. For each of these factors, I\u2019m going to share how we use it at Superhuman and how you can use it in your own products.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Slide3.jpeg?ssl=1\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-297579\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"405\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Slide3.jpeg?resize=720%2C405&amp;ssl=1\" width=\"720\"/></a></p>\n<p>Games need goals. In fact, goals are a defining feature of games, but we can\u2019t just have any goals. We need good goals that are concrete, achievable, and rewarding.</p>\n<p>At Superhuman, we set a very concrete goal: get to inbox zero. But the goal must also be achievable, which is why we onboard our users. For each new user, we do a live concierge onboarding. This is a one-to-one 30-minute video call with one of our wonderful onboarding specialists. We teach faster workflows to get to inbox zero. We show powerful shortcuts so you never have to touch the mouse. And if you\u2019re far away from inbox zero, we\u2019ll wipe the slate clean so that you\u2019re close, thus making the goal more achievable.</p>\n<p>But the goal must also be rewarding. When you hit inbox zero, you feel triumph over your email, a previously rare and incredibly rewarding experience.</p>\n<p>Most business goals aren\u2019t clear. Business software does not have clear goals. And if they are clear, they are usually unrewarding and unachievable. This brings us to the first principle of game design. If you want to make software like a game, then create goals that are concrete, achievable, and rewarding.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Slide4.jpeg?ssl=1\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-297578\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"405\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Slide4.jpeg?resize=720%2C405&amp;ssl=1\" width=\"720\"/></a></p>\n<p>Now, the best games create strong emotions because emotions are the foundation of our memory. We must, therefore, be able to analyze emotion. To do that, we need vocabulary.</p>\n<p>There are many models of human emotion. The most famous is Plutchik\u2019s wheel. Plutchik identified eight core emotions. Opposite emotions across from each other. For example, joy is opposite from grief. You can blend adjacent emotions to create new complex feelings. For example, when you combine joy and anticipation, you get optimism. When you combine joy and trust, you get love.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Slide5.jpeg?ssl=1\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-297577\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"405\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Slide5.jpeg?resize=720%2C405&amp;ssl=1\" width=\"720\"/></a></p>\n<p>But as game designers, we need a much richer vocabulary than academia provides. The emotions we are aiming for are much more nuanced. This is the most useful model I have found by the Junto Institute, and it contains the subtleties that we need to care about.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Slide6.jpeg?ssl=1\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-297576\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"405\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Slide6.jpeg?resize=720%2C405&amp;ssl=1\" width=\"720\"/></a></p>\n<p>At Superhuman, we care deeply about joy. We design for enthusiasm and excitement. Our users come to us super excited to use the products. We design for hopefulness and optimism. Our users really want Superhuman to improve their lives. We design for pride and triumph, for when you hit inbox zero, especially if it\u2019s the first time in years, you rightly feel like you accomplished something special.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Slide7.jpeg?ssl=1\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-297575\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"405\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Slide7.jpeg?resize=720%2C405&amp;ssl=1\" width=\"720\"/></a></p>\n<p>When you do hit inbox zero, we show you stunning and gorgeous imagery. We do this to widen our emotional repertoire beyond joy into love and surprise. We show images that are serene and peaceful, images that create a sense of longing and sentimentality, images that even amaze and inspire a sense of awe.</p>\n<p>You can also use the wheel to find emotions to remove. Many people come to us with negative feelings about their own email. They may feel helpless, anxious, annoyed, guilty, even powerless. This brings us to our second principle of game design: design for nuanced emotion.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Slide8.jpeg?ssl=1\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-297574\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"405\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Slide8.jpeg?resize=720%2C405&amp;ssl=1\" width=\"720\"/></a></p>\n<p>Controls can be one of the main reasons why a game succeeds. Consider the Wiimote. The original Wii sold over 100 million units, and every controller since incorporated motion. But games require much more robust controls than we typically build for business software. Imagine you\u2019re playing a game like \u201cStreet Fighter.\u201d It would be incredibly frustrating if the game ignored half your inputs, and your character flopped around, and then you died. But that is the status quo for business software today.</p>\n<p>Let\u2019s say I want to email my co-founder, Conrad. In Gmail, the shortcut to compose an email is C. So I hit C, and then I type Conrad. In Gmail, if I do this too fast, I end up with two drafts, and I\u2019m sending an email to Rad. In Superhuman, we pipeline our keystrokes so this can never happen. In case you think I\u2019m picking on Gmail, this kind of error is status quo for business software today.</p>\n<p>This brings us to our third principle of game design: create rapid and robust controls.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Slide9.jpeg?ssl=1\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-297573\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"405\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Slide9.jpeg?resize=720%2C405&amp;ssl=1\" width=\"720\"/></a></p>\n<p>Are toys the same as games? We play with toys, but we play games. A ball is a toy, but baseball is a game. As it turns out, the best games are made with toys. And then they are fun on multiple levels, the level of the toy and of the game itself.</p>\n<p>In Superhuman, a favorite toy is the time autocompleter. You use this to snooze your emails. You can type in whatever you want. It may be gibberish, and it will do its best to understand you. For example, 3D becomes three days; 3H, three hours; 1MO, one month.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Slide10.jpeg?ssl=1\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-297572\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"405\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Slide10.jpeg?resize=720%2C405&amp;ssl=1\" width=\"720\"/></a></p>\n<p>The time autocompleter is fun because it indulges playful exploration. What does it do? How does it work? When does it break? It\u2019s not long in onboardings before people start trying to do things like this. Well, I wonder what happens if I keep on typing 10? Well, it turns out that\u2019s October the 10th at 10:10 p.m. Or what happens if I put the p.m. in the middle? Well, it seems like that still works. What happens if I type out a sequence of twos? Well, that\u2019s February the 2nd, 2020 at 2:00 p.m.</p>\n<p>And then you might start to try more complex inputs. How about in a fortnight and a day? It\u2019s not long before you find pleasant surprises. For example, you never have to do time zone math again \u00e2\u0080\u0093 8:00 a.m. in Tokyo, no problem. That\u2019s 8:00 p.m., Eastern. Many of our users are delighted to find that if they really want, they can snooze an email until never.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Slide11.jpeg?ssl=1\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-297564\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"405\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Slide11.jpeg?resize=720%2C405&amp;ssl=1\" width=\"720\"/></a></p>\n<p>Principle four: make fun toys and then combine them into games. Consider your own product. Is it fun, even without a goal? Does it indulge moments of playful exploration? Does it create moments of pleasant surprise? If so, congratulations because then you have a toy and you\u2019re on the way to building a great game.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Slide12.jpeg?ssl=1\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-297571\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"405\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Slide12.jpeg?resize=720%2C405&amp;ssl=1\" width=\"720\"/></a></p>\n<p>Now, the previous four factors are critical to game design. Flow is perhaps the least understood. Flow is the intense and focused concentration on the present. Flow is so absorbing that we don\u2019t worry about the past or think about the future. Flow is so demanding that we don\u2019t care about what others think about us. Flow is so easy that we always know what to do next. Flow is so powerful that we lose track of time. It can either flash by in an instant or stretch out for infinity. And flow is so rewarding that our activities become intrinsically motivating, which as we know from earlier, is the most powerful and effective form of motivation.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Slide13.jpeg?ssl=1\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-297570\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"405\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Slide13.jpeg?resize=720%2C405&amp;ssl=1\" width=\"720\"/></a></p>\n<p>In other words, flow is incredible. How do we make it? Well, these are the conditions:</p>\n<p>1. You must always know what to do next.<br/>\n2. You must always know how to do it.<br/>\n3. You must be free from distractions.<br/>\n4. You must get clear and immediate feedback.<br/>\n5. And this is the hardest to get right. You must feel a balance between challenge and skill.</p>\n<p>We can visualize the relationship between challenge and skill with the experience fluctuation model. If the activity is too hard, you\u2019ll feel anxious. If the activity is too easy, you\u2019ll feel relaxed or bored. To truly feel in flow, you need to perceive a high challenge and match it with high skill.</p>\n<p>So, how do we create flow in Superhuman? Well, let\u2019s take these conditions one by one.</p>\n<p>Number one: knowing what to do next. You can make product decisions that make this dramatically easier for your users. In Gmail, when I archive this email, I end up back on the inbox. I now have to decide what to do next, and I have to do this every single time. This destroys flow. In Superhuman, when I archive the same email, I immediately see the next one. I don\u2019t have to make any decisions at all. This creates flow.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Slide15.jpeg?ssl=1\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-297568\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"405\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Slide15.jpeg?resize=720%2C405&amp;ssl=1\" width=\"720\"/></a></p>\n<p>Number two: knowing how to do it. Early on, we saw that users would forget our shortcuts. They knew what they wanted to do, but they didn\u2019t know how to do it. So, we built Superhuman command. Simply hit command K, enter what you want to do, and not only will it do it for you, it will teach you the shortcut for next time.</p>\n<p>Next up: freedom from distractions. In Superhuman, you can only see one conversation at a time, and you cannot see the inbox at the same time as the conversation. And so, quite deliberately, you can\u2019t see what\u2019s coming next or any new email. You can design your interfaces like this to reduce distraction and so create flow.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Slide16.jpeg?ssl=1\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-297567\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"405\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Slide16.jpeg?resize=720%2C405&amp;ssl=1\" width=\"720\"/></a></p>\n<p>And the thing I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m most excited to share is this balance between challenge and skill. This is the experience fluctuation model. For most people, Gmail is the left-hand slice. Some people feel apathetic or worried. Their skill level is low-to-medium, but their email doesn\u2019t matter that much. Some people feel further up the left-hand side. Their skill level is low-to-medium, but their email does matter. Many people feel anxious. The skill level is low-to-medium, but their email really does matter, and they are failing at it. This is actually how most users come to us.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Slide14.jpeg?ssl=1\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-297569\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"405\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Slide14.jpeg?resize=720%2C405&amp;ssl=1\" width=\"720\"/></a></p>\n<p>At Superhuman, we massively increase the skill level for almost everybody. But what happens if your email wasn\u2019t that challenging to begin with or you are already highly skilled? Well, then, and this is going to sound crazy, we increase the challenge level. We give you a really challenging goal: hit inbox zero without ever touching the mouse. This balances your perceived skill with the perceived challenge, thus resulting in flow.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Slide17.jpeg?ssl=1\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-297566\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"405\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Slide17.jpeg?resize=720%2C405&amp;ssl=1\" width=\"720\"/></a></p>\n<p>Flow is so important that it actually gives us three principles: make the next action obvious, give clear feedback immediately and with no distraction, and balance high perceived skill with high perceived challenge. This may counterintuitively mean making your products harder to use.</p>\n<p>These are our seven principles of game design. If you follow these, your users will be intrinsically motivated. They will use your products, not because they have to, but because they find it inherently interesting and satisfying. With these seven principles, you can create products that are delightful, amazing, magical, and which fundamentally are games.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Slide18.jpeg?ssl=1\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-297565\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"405\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Slide18.jpeg?resize=720%2C405&amp;ssl=1\" width=\"720\"/></a></p>\n", "author": "Rahul Vohra"}, "6": {"podcast": "The End of Cloud Computing | Andreessen Horowitz", "url": "https://a16z.com/2019/11/15/the-end-of-cloud-computing-2/", "contents": "In this talk from Summit 2017, General Partner Peter Levine explains how cloud technology is changing for an edge cloud model.

I\u2019m going to take you out to the edge, no pun intended. I know what you\u2019re all thinking. How can I actually say that cloud computing is coming to an end when it hasn\u2019t really started yet?

These companies or these technologies will be around forever.\u201d</span></p>\n<h2><b>The Forrest Gump Rule of Investing</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Everything that\u2019s popular in technology always gets replaced by something else. The beauty of the business is that things actually go away, and part of our job as investors is to look not at where the puck is today, but where the puck is going to be in the future, typically five or 10 years out. It takes a long time for companies to build up and you want to hit that puck where it intends to be.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s actually a very simple exercise that I would encourage you all to do if you ever want to predict the future. Subtract something that\u2019s important today and fill it with something else, and you\u2019ll start to think out of the box, as opposed to sequentially. I believe that if you subtract something, you can actually fill it with other dimensions that you might not think about otherwise.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">I call it my Forrest Gump Rule of Investing. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s so simple: you just subtract something and replace it with something else. About six months ago, I started to think, \u201cWell, what happens when cloud computing goes away? It\u2019s so popular now, how could it go away?\u201d Yet, I think it\u2019s actually happening right under our noses, and let me explain why I think that\u2019s occurring.</span></p>\n<h2><b>Changes in the Cloud</b></h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Return-to-the-Edge-\u00e2\u0080\u0093-End-of-Cloud-Computing.004.jpeg?ssl=1\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-296567\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"576\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Return-to-the-Edge-\u00e2\u0080\u0093-End-of-Cloud-Computing.004.jpeg?resize=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1\" width=\"1024\"/></a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Today\u2019s world is a centralized world, and the central cloud is where all processing gets done. When we do a Google search or whenever you type something in your phone, that little stream of information goes back to the cloud, it gets processed, and then the information comes back to your phone. All of that\u2019s being done centrally. To some degree, your mobile devices are a terminal or a vehicle that displays what\u2019s happening in the cloud itself. We\u2019re living in a very centralized model of the world.\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">When it comes to the end of cloud computing, I thought, \u201cWell, maybe our mobile devices get more sophisticated.\u00e2\u0080\u009d When I text anyone in this room, my text doesn\u2019t go directly to you. It goes to some data center in Norway and then comes back here.\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">I started to think, \u201cMaybe mobile devices become this next generation and albeit the need for the cloud.\u201d Intellectually, however, this became a cul-de-sac, and I thought, \u201cWell, it isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t mobile devices but all the other things that are going to be out at the edge that will truly transform cloud computing and put an end to what we know as the cloud.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Return-to-the-Edge-\u00e2\u0080\u0093-End-of-Cloud-Computing.005.jpeg?ssl=1\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-296568\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"576\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Return-to-the-Edge-\u00e2\u0080\u0093-End-of-Cloud-Computing.005.jpeg?resize=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1\" width=\"1024\"/></a><br/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The change is that the edge is going to become a lot more sophisticated. Not with mobile devices but broadly speaking \u2014 with the Internet of Things.\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">I know we hear a lot about drones, robots, and all the Internet of Things objects that will be created over the next 10 years. A self-driving car is effectively a data center on wheels, a drone is a data center with wings, a robot is a data center with arms and legs, a boat is a floating data center, and it goes on and on.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">These devices are collecting vast amounts of information, and that information needs to be processed in real time. There isn\u2019t the time for that information to go back to the central cloud and get processed in the same way that a Google search gets processed in the cloud right now. This shift is going to obviate cloud computing as we know it.</span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Return-to-the-Edge-\u00e2\u0080\u0093-End-of-Cloud-Computing.006.jpeg?ssl=1\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-296569\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"576\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Return-to-the-Edge-\u00e2\u0080\u0093-End-of-Cloud-Computing.006.jpeg?resize=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1\" width=\"1024\"/></a><br/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">This is a circuit board from the inside of a luxury automobile today, not of a self-driving car. It has about 100 CPUs in it. Now, a self-driving car in the not-too-distant future may have 100 to 200 of these cards. These hundreds of connected computers in a car become a data center. When you then think about connecting thousands of cars together, it becomes a massive distributed computing system at the edge of the network. We are entering the next world of distributed computing, just like we saw in the past. It\u2019s literally \u201cBack to the Future\u201d where processing gets done because of these very sophisticated endpoint devices.</span></p>\n<h2><b>\u00e2\u0080\u009cBack to the Future\u00e2\u0080\u009d: Data-Driven Change</b></h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Return-to-the-Edge-\u00e2\u0080\u0093-End-of-Cloud-Computing.007.jpeg?ssl=1\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-296570\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"576\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Return-to-the-Edge-\u00e2\u0080\u0093-End-of-Cloud-Computing.007.jpeg?resize=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1\" width=\"1024\"/></a><br/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">It\u2019s interesting to note that it\u2019s really all about the data. For the first time in computing history, we\u2019re collecting real-world data about our environment, whether that\u2019s vision, location, acceleration, temperature, gravity information, etc. We\u2019re collecting the world around us visually through very sophisticated sensors.\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Up until now, computing has fundamentally been humans typing things via keyboard, or a computer generating log files or information from a database; but this is the first time we\u2019re collecting the world\u2019s information. The data is massive.\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Real-time data processing will need to occur at the edge where real-world information is being collected. Let\u2019s say we\u2019re collecting real-world information on a self-driving car. It\u2019s collecting images, and as part of an image, there\u2019s a stop sign. We take that data and send it off to the cloud to decide whether there was a stop sign or a person crossing the road. The car would have blown through the stop sign and run over 10 people before the cloud came back and said, \u201cHey, you need to stop.\u201d The notion of real-time becomes a very important ingredient given the massive amounts of real-world information.\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">We\u2019re not talking text information. This is about collecting video and streams of information. Both of these things need to work together, and data will absolutely drive this change.</span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Return-to-the-Edge-\u00e2\u0080\u0093-End-of-Cloud-Computing.008.jpeg?ssl=1\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-296571\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"576\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Return-to-the-Edge-\u00e2\u0080\u0093-End-of-Cloud-Computing.008.jpeg?resize=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1\" width=\"1024\"/></a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">I mentioned distributed computing. We are now returning to \u201cBack to the Future.\u201d When you think about the trends in computing, we started with Mainframes as the beginning of the modern computer era. That was a centralized model. We then moved to a Client-Server model in the \u201980s and \u201990s and that was a distributed model. Mobile-Cloud brought us back to a centralized model, and believe it or not, we are returning to an Edge Intelligence Distributed computing model. This absolutely follows the trends in computing from centralized to distributed.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Within each of these trends, we have a massive uptake in the number of users and devices that are out there. In the best case scenario, there were 10,000 mainframes and 1,000 people per mainframe, so that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s about 10 million people max on mainframes. When we moved to PCs, we had about two billion people using PCs. We begin to see increasing orders of magnitude.\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">I\u2019ve always thought a total addressable market for computing is the number of humans on the planet. After all, once every human has a mobile device, why do we need more computers?\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Well, the Internet of Things actually drives us to an entirely new dimension because computers are no longer attached to humans. Let\u2019s say everyone on the planet has a mobile phone. That makes nearly seven billion phones. I can imagine a world where there will be trillions of devices out there. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll soon face the opportunities and challenges of management, security, data, and all of the issues of distributed computing. It\u2019s happening right now with cars and drones, and it will proliferate to other devices in the not-too-distant future.</span></p>\n<h2><b>Machine Learning at the Edge</b></h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Return-to-the-Edge-\u00e2\u0080\u0093-End-of-Cloud-Computing.009.jpeg?ssl=1\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-296572\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"576\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Return-to-the-Edge-\u00e2\u0080\u0093-End-of-Cloud-Computing.009.jpeg?resize=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1\" width=\"1024\"/></a><br/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The other ingredient is the intersection of machine learning and endpoint data that we\u2019re collecting.\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">I believe that machine learning catalyzes the edge adoption. There\u2019s massive amounts of real-world information that requires a machine learning approach to decipher the nuances of the real world. The only way that we can look into an image or massive amounts of data is through machine learning. The algorithms and applications employing machine learning will run at the endpoint. However, it\u2019s not going to be machine learning running in the cloud. So, what does the cloud become in this case?\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The cloud becomes the last point of information storage and a place where learning occurs. Important information will still get stored in a centralized cloud but much of the processing in this new world will move out to the edge, and that\u2019s where the most important decisions will get made.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">This matters because it turns out that humans are notoriously poor at making decisions. I have a Tesla, and I think that Autopilot, which is a very simple step towards a world of automation, is hugely beneficial. My Autopilot is a better driver than I am, even with all its flaws. I\u2019m a terrible driver because I text and yell at my kids, but Autopilot has none of those issues \u2014 it just goes down the road. We can see how data and machine learning is more helpful to us than we ourselves are helpful to our own data.</span></p>\n<h2><b>Within the Edge</b></h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Return-to-the-Edge-\u00e2\u0080\u0093-End-of-Cloud-Computing.010.jpeg?ssl=1\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-296573\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"576\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Return-to-the-Edge-\u00e2\u0080\u0093-End-of-Cloud-Computing.010.jpeg?resize=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1\" width=\"1024\"/></a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Let me take you inside the edge and talk about what\u2019s happening at the edge, and then centrally in the cloud.\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">At the edge, three things are happening: Sensing, Inference, and Action. There\u2019s actually a very interesting parallel here with fighter pilots. Colonel John Boyd, a top dogfighter, invented a feedback loop called the OODA loop to train pilots. OODA stands for Observe, Orient, Decide and Act. Basically, if he could take a fighter pilot and create the fastest loop in his or her brain to process information during a dogfight, then they can win every battle against the enemy. The faster the reaction to that loop, the better the chances of winning.\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The OODA loop prioritized agility over power. When we think about this new edge computing paradigm, it really is agility over power. The endpoint device is nowhere near as powerful as the cloud itself, but we can be more agile because that information loop is going quickly to the edge, processing just the information that it needs. Over time, that loop, which I\u2019ll call the Sense, Infer and Act Loop, will get faster and tighter against new information as processing and machine learning gets more powerful. There\u2019s a big parallel between this new world and the frameworks for fighter pilots.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Meanwhile, the cloud is going to be all about central learning. I\u2019m going to take all of this information that I have out at the edge and connect these devices. I\u2019ll curate the information, while learning occurs centrally, and then propagate that information back to each endpoint device, creating an ever tighter, more agile loop that happens at the edge.</span></p>\n<h2><b>Within the Edge: Sense</b></h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Return-to-the-Edge-\u00e2\u0080\u0093-End-of-Cloud-Computing.011.jpeg?ssl=1\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-296574\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"576\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Return-to-the-Edge-\u00e2\u0080\u0093-End-of-Cloud-Computing.011.jpeg?resize=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1\" width=\"1024\"/></a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The first is Sense. Sensors will include cameras, depth sensors, radar, accelerometers and will be everywhere generating massive amounts of information. A self-driving car generates about 10 gigabytes of data per mile. That\u2019s a lot of data. A lytro camera, which is a data center in a camera, generates 300 gigabytes of data a second. Sensors will be in just about everything, not just complex devices like a car or a camera.\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">I put a picture of a running shoe here because in the not-too-distant future, we will have sensors in running shoes. The sensor will collect information and a machine learning algorithm with a very fast loop will run so that when you\u2019re running, your shoe will indicate, \u201cHey, you\u2019re going up a hill. You should shorten your stride,\u201d or \u201cYou\u2019re not doing as well as yesterday,\u201d or \u201cYou should pack it up for today and go home and rest.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Simple devices like a running shoe can generate a lot of information on the world around it.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The data collected is extremely valuable but also too much to be pushed back every time. Imagine if I had to push 10 gigabytes of data in a car for every mile back to the centralized cloud to get processed. It won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t happen there. It has to be done at the edge.</span></p>\n<h2><b>Within the Edge: Infer</b></h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Return-to-the-Edge-\u00e2\u0080\u0093-End-of-Cloud-Computing.012.jpeg?ssl=1\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-296575\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"576\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Return-to-the-Edge-\u00e2\u0080\u0093-End-of-Cloud-Computing.012.jpeg?resize=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1\" width=\"1024\"/></a><br/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The second is Inference. The data being collected at the edge is very unstructured. It\u2019s the first time that we\u2019re seeing such massive amounts of unstructured and highly variable data. Inferences occurs when machine learning extracts relevance out of the data itself, whether it\u2019s a stop sign, a person, a tree, or your running cadence. This will give us powerful task-specific recognition that requires training and data to again, keep the loop getting ever so tight.</span></p>\n<h2><b>Within the Edge: Act</b></h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Return-to-the-Edge-\u00e2\u0080\u0093-End-of-Cloud-Computing.013.jpeg?ssl=1\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-296576\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"576\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Return-to-the-Edge-\u00e2\u0080\u0093-End-of-Cloud-Computing.013.jpeg?resize=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1\" width=\"1024\"/></a><br/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Action is the final element after we Sense and Infer. Critical safety responsiveness of edge systems will require real-time data decisions. That is, waiting for the response from the cloud is going to be too slow.\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">I was around when the world entered the first wave of distributed computing and it was exactly the same argument. If I had a workstation on my desk and I could do processing at the edge, I don\u2019t have to wait for information to go back to the centralized server. The data accumulates at the edge, and the processing stays near the data. As IOT devices get more sophisticated and intelligent, sensors and computing power will increase. We\u2019re witnessing the beginning of it right now. In the future, there will be sensors and machine learning algorithms. Things will get more complex in terms of the amount of data that\u2019s being collected.</span></p>\n<h2><b>Within the Cloud: Learning</b></h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Return-to-the-Edge-\u00e2\u0080\u0093-End-of-Cloud-Computing.014.jpeg?ssl=1\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-296577\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"576\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Return-to-the-Edge-\u00e2\u0080\u0093-End-of-Cloud-Computing.014.jpeg?resize=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1\" width=\"1024\"/></a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">So what happens to the cloud? The cloud becomes a training center for all of this information. One of the fundamental aspects of machine learning is that it needs lots of data in order to learn. This new Edge Cloud model has large amounts of data coming into a centralized repository and gets smarter on that information. We may have hundreds of thousands of automobile collecting information, and that information will be curated at the edge. Not all information comes back. The cloud will only store important information, and then the learning will propagate back to the edge devices.\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">That\u2019s how things are going to get smarter. The cloud does have a purpose and won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t completely go away. SaaS applications will continue to work in the cloud, but this new model will take it to a whole new level.</span></p>\n<h2><b>Opportunities and Challenges in the New Edge Cloud</b></h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Return-to-the-Edge-\u00e2\u0080\u0093-End-of-Cloud-Computing.016.jpeg?ssl=1\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-296579\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"576\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Return-to-the-Edge-\u00e2\u0080\u0093-End-of-Cloud-Computing.016.jpeg?resize=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1\" width=\"1024\"/></a><br/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Here are some predictions of what happens from this point forward.\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Sensor data explosion will kill the cloud. Sensors will produce massive amounts of data, but the existing infrastructure will not be able to handle the volumes or the rates. The data will be stuck at the edge and computing is going to move along with that data at the edge. We are absolutely going to return to a peer-to-peer computing model, where the edge devices connect together, creating a network of endpoint devices not unlike the distributed computing model.\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">This will impact a variety of things, including network and security. Security challenges of data collection and networking challenges of connecting trillions of peer-to-peer devices that are communicating and processing information together without a centralized information pool will be either the opportunity or challenge of this next era of computing.</span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Return-to-the-Edge-\u00e2\u0080\u0093-End-of-Cloud-Computing.017.jpeg?ssl=1\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-296580\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"576\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Return-to-the-Edge-\u00e2\u0080\u0093-End-of-Cloud-Computing.017.jpeg?resize=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1\" width=\"1024\"/></a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">We are going to move to a world of data-centric programming. I believe the cloud disaggregates into this new model. Right now, we\u2019re teaching everyone to code logic. However, we\u2019re going to use data to actually solve problems, and so the next generation of coders will have to be mathematicians and data analysts. There\u2019s a transformation of the type of talent that we\u2019re going to be needing in terms of this particular information. I also believe that there will be new programming languages developed specifically around the notion of data processing and data analytics that are very specific to use cases.</span></p>\n<h2><b>Power Increases, Price Decreases</b></h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Return-to-the-Edge-\u00e2\u0080\u0093-End-of-Cloud-Computing.018.jpeg?ssl=1\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-296581\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"576\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Return-to-the-Edge-\u00e2\u0080\u0093-End-of-Cloud-Computing.018.jpeg?resize=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1\" width=\"1024\"/></a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">And finally, as the processing power of the edge increases, the price will decrease. We\u2019ve seen this with every transformation of computing. If you think about the mobile supply chain, 20 billion mobile phones have been sold and 5 billion are in use. That\u2019s a great supply chain. Memory, CPUs, networking and all this stuff in a mobile phone is so inexpensive because there\u2019s been 20 billion of phones produced.\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Imagine when there will be trillions of these IOT devices. Think about the impact of the supply chain on helping to commoditize processing power and sensors. Just as some anecdotal evidence here, the current iPhone 7 has 3.3 billion with AB transistors. The original Pentium processor in 1993 had 3.1 million with M transistors. Think about the power increase between then and now \u2014 it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s only going to accelerate.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">From a cost standpoint, we\u2019re already seeing sensors come down to a cost where I can put sensors in running shoes. $100,000 sensors can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t go into running shoes; otherwise you\u2019re not going to buy a running shoe. LIDAR is used for detection in self-driving cars, which you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve probably seen on top of a Google Car. The first LIDAR for a Google Car was $75,000. Now, LIDAR is sub $500. There aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even self-driving cars out there. I bet you LIDAR goes to 50 cents in the not-too-distant future.\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">I can put sensors in literally everything. From shoes to glasses to your ears, wherever. So if power goes up by several orders of magnitude and price comes down, what happens? It all needs to be connected.</span></p>\n<h2><b>A Connected World</b></h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Return-to-the-Edge-\u00e2\u0080\u0093-End-of-Cloud-Computing.019.jpeg?ssl=1\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-296582\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"576\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Return-to-the-Edge-\u00e2\u0080\u0093-End-of-Cloud-Computing.019.jpeg?resize=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1\" width=\"1024\"/></a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The entire world becomes the domain of IT. For those of you who think that your job as CIOs or IT managers has gotten easier, this will be an opportunity of a lifetime. You move from five billion devices to a trillion devices that all need to be managed and coordinated together. Every industry will be subject to this. If I\u2019m in the insurance industry and I run a fleet of drones to inspect houses, who\u2019s going to manage them? There will be so many applications that will combine what we think as consumer-oriented applications with enterprise manageability.\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">As we saw with distributed computing in the late \u201980s and early \u201990s, and with mainframe and the cloud, there is a big disruption on the horizon. It\u2019s going to impact networking, storage, computing, programming languages, security, and of course, management. I would encourage you to get ready for one of the biggest transformations to occur on the computing landscape. It\u2019s happening right underneath our eyes. What do you think now?\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Return-to-the-Edge-\u00e2\u0080\u0093-End-of-Cloud-Computing.020.jpeg?ssl=1\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-296583\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"576\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Return-to-the-Edge-\u00e2\u0080\u0093-End-of-Cloud-Computing.020.jpeg?resize=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1\" width=\"1024\"/></a></p>\n", "author": "Peter Levine"}, "7": {"podcast": "Andreessen Horowitz", "url": "https://info.a16z.com/preferences.html", "contents": "Enterprise Newsletter Analysis of the latest trends reshaping B2B and enterprise tech.

And then you, as a user, can purchase shares of that asset. So on the one hand, you actually have a piece of equity, a share in something that is theoretically valuable. On the other hand, you have the status of owner that is valuable in a more emotional sense.\u00e2\u0080\u009d <a href=\"https://a16z.com/2020/12/07/social-strikes-back-social-meets-fintech/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The Holy Grail of Social + Fintech</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, D\u00e2\u0080\u0099Arcy Coolican</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #a4d233\"><strong>Fraud:</strong></span> \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe fact is that I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think limiting fraud or finding the fraudsters is all that challenging or all that expensive to do.

And then there\u2019s a clash of cultures. And then usually they arrive at, I don\u2019t think that was truthful, what he said here, or this thing that he said didn\u2019t logically follow from the other statement, and so on. I don\u2019t think we should hire this person. I\u2019m a no.</p>\n<p>So, then they pass on all these people, and then they say, you know, I finally found the salesperson that\u2019s really awesome. And then it\u2019s an engineer type, who\u2019s like them, super cerebral, maybe even introverted. But guess what, they\u2019ll probably suck at sales. Because you basically hired yourself in a role where you actually need a different culture to succeed.</p>\n<p><strong>\u00e2\u0080\u008cBen:</strong> I definitely agree. You know, a really interesting thing that I find with engineers trying to hire salespeople is, if you ask an engineer a question, the engineer will always ask himself, \u00e2\u0080\u009cokay, what\u2019s the answer?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Salespeople never do that. \u201cWhy are you asking this?\u201d That\u2019s what they want to know. And they\u2019re kind of suspicious by nature, if they\u2019re good. You roll an engineer into an account, and they say, \u201cHey, do you have this feature?\u201d And the engineer will go, yes or no. But the sales guy will go, \u201cWhy is he asking me about that feature? Which competitors have that feature? I need to know that before I say anything.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00e2\u0080\u008cAnd they\u2019ll do that to you in the interview. And this makes CEOs who are engineers really uncomfortable. Because they\u2019ll ask them a question, and they won\u2019t tell them the answer. They\u2019ll get a question back.</p>\n<p><strong>\u00e2\u0080\u008cAli:</strong> We had a sales guy. At that time, we\u2019re trying to figure out a pricing model, and pay as you go was a thing, you know, elastic pricing and all that. So we asked this sort of sales candidate, \u201cWhat do you think about pay as you go pricing?\u201d And he just looked at us and said, \u201cI like when it goes up.\u201d We all laughed, but then we said, \u201cOkay. But when it goes down?\u201d He said, \u201cDon\u2019t like it then.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00e2\u0080\u008cHe didn\u2019t want to answer the question. And actually, he was smart, because that question had divided the founders. There was a right answer and a wrong answer. And he knew it. And he\u2019s like, \u201cI\u2019m not going to tell you. Because if I say this, who knows? Is that the right answer or the wrong? So I\u2019ll say I like when it goes up, I don\u2019t like when it goes down. What do you guys think?\u201d</p>\n<p><strong>\u00e2\u0080\u008cBen:</strong> Yeah, yeah. Definitely, definitely. And then once you get them on board, what are kind of mistakes that you see? What are the things that you had to figure out when you brought on Ron [Gabrisko, Databricks CRO]? Because he was really different than everybody you had in the company at that point.</p>\n<p><strong>\u00e2\u0080\u008cAli:</strong> One of the skills that most great sales leaders have, they\u2019re really good negotiators. So they\u2019ll be negotiating with you. So, you\u2019ve got to be prepared for that. If they\u2019re not doing that, I think there\u2019s a problem. Like, for instance, with Ron, it started with completely obnoxious, outrageous demands on compensation, which meant he\u2019s a good sales guy, he\u2019s going to get big deals for us. But then that continues, when you\u2019re setting the targets for the year, when you\u2019re setting up the plans for the year. If you have an amazing salesperson, you\u2019re basically negotiating with a person who loves negotiations. And that\u2019s what he does for a living from 7am till 8pm, 9pm every night. Can you get comfortable doing that, or do you think as an engineer, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI can\u2019t deal with this, and this other guy seems much more of a straight shooter or logical.\u00e2\u0080\u009d</p>\n<p><strong>\u00e2\u0080\u008cBen:</strong> Yeah, yeah. And what I always say is, you have to learn to manage diversity. And there are different kinds of diversity. And probably in an enterprise software company, the sales person is going to be the first person who gets hired coming from a really different way\u2026</p>\n<p><strong>\u00e2\u0080\u008cAli:</strong> Yeah, sales in pretty much every company is actually a distinct culture from the rest of the company. Just start with something as simple as compensation. You\u2019ve changed the culture by saying, these guys get paid completely differently from everyone else in the company, in a radically different way. You know, very little equity, and they get huge packages, and they might make millions of dollars, but most of it is variable, and they have to earn it.</p>\n<p><strong>\u00e2\u0080\u008cBen:</strong> Yeah, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a lot of CEOs that don\u2019t want to pay commission, which is crazy in sales. I remember I had this conversation with one of my CEOs. I said, \u201cTell me this, do you have any engineers that ever on a weekend, will actually write some software or do something like that?\u201d And he goes, \u201cYeah, I have people like that.\u201d I said, \u201cWell, I guarantee you, you don\u2019t have any sales people who sell software for fun on the weekend.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00e2\u0080\u008cIt has to be competitive. There has to be a president\u2019s club, there has to be commissions, because it\u2019s a prize fight. And no prize, no fight.</p>\n<p><strong>For more\u2026</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://a16z.com/2018/09/02/sales-startups-technical-founders\">All Things Sales: 16 Mini-Lessons for Startup Founders</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://a16z.com/2017/05/26/hiring-sales-why-what\">Hire a Head of Sales</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://a16z.com/2015/03/03/how-to-manage-vp-of-sales\">Managing a VP of Sales: It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Not Supposed to be Easy</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://a16z.com/2017/09/11/sales-commissions\">Why Must You Pay Sales People Commissions?</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://a16z.com/2015/07/23/sales-compensation-beware-you-get-what-you-ask-for\">Sales Compensation: Beware, You Get What You Asked For</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://a16z.com/2018/10/19/when-sales-isnt-just-selling-advice-for-founders-in-early-markets\">When Sales Isn\u2019t Just Selling: Advice for Founders in Early Markets</a></li>\n</ul>\n<span class=\"bctt-click-to-tweet\"><span class=\"bctt-ctt-text\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https://a16z.com/2021/03/05/boss-talk-with-ben-and-ali-enterprise-selling-for-technical-founders/&amp;text=It%20has%20to%20be%20competitive.%20There%20has%20to%20be%20a%20president%27s%20club%2C%20there%20has%20to%20be%20commissions%2C%20because%20it%27s%20a%20prize%20fight.%20And%20no%20prize%2C%20no%20fight.%20-Ben%20Horowitz&amp;via=a16z&amp;related=a16z\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">It has to be competitive.

So, if you already have a sales leader, it\u2019s really, really important that that person gets along with whoever you\u2019re going to hire in marketing. In some sense, sales is the customer for marketing. Marketing generates the leads and delivers those leads to the customer, which is sales, sales then runs with it. And if sales says, these leads are crappy, then it doesn\u2019t matter. Or if they say, \u00e2\u0080\u009chey, this message you gave me is useless. Like, I\u2019m not going to use it. I\u2019m going to come up with my own.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Then why do you have a marketing department? And that happens. It\u2019s very common. So if you already have a sales guy, make sure that he or she is a really integral part of that search process when you\u2019re getting the marketing leader.</p>\n<p><strong>\u00e2\u0080\u008cBen:</strong> Yeah. Right. Because if they hate each other, then you\u2019re breaking up that fight all the time.</p>\n<p><strong>\u00e2\u0080\u008cAli:</strong> Yeah. And it has to match\u2026 Different companies have different go-to-market motions. A company like Tableau was selling desktop licenses for $2,000. A company like Palantir, I suspect, is selling contracts that are always at least seven figures or maybe eight figures. The kind of leads you need and the kind of marketing you need is different. So make sure that the marketing leader you\u2019re getting fits what you have on the sales side.</p>\n<p><strong>\u00e2\u0080\u008cBen:</strong> Yeah, that\u2019s a really good point, in that, when you hire an executive, you\u2019re paying a lot of money and equity, and you\u2019re buying knowledge. And so if you bring in a head of marketing, and you\u2019re a B2B API SaaS company, and that head of marketing is from whatever, Palantir, then you\u2019ve screwed up, because you need somebody who\u2019s from a company like yours, because you\u2019re buying that. You just paid them for knowledge they don\u2019t have. And that\u2019s insane because what you\u2019re really doing with these executives is you\u2019re accelerating the entire company\u2019s time to learn how to go to market.</p>\n<p>\u00e2\u0080\u008cAnd this is a mistake people make. They\u2019re like, well, do they really have to come from the domain? Yes, they really have to come from the domain. Do they really have to know the customers that I\u2019m selling to? Yes, they really have to know the customers that you\u2019re selling to, because that\u2019s what you\u2019re buying.</p>\n<p><strong>\u00e2\u0080\u008cAli:</strong> Yeah. The other mistake a lot of companies do, and I think Databricks did in the early days, which is, you sit down and say, what kind of go-to-market would I want? Oh, I\u2019d like to have million dollar deals, or I\u2019d like to have $10,000 deals. So at Databricks, we made the mistake early on, where we said, \u201coh, we don\u2019t even want to have salespeople. It\u2019s better if it\u2019s super automated, and people just swipe a credit card, and it just grows like that. That\u2019s the one we pick.\u201d As if it\u2019s a choice you can just make.</p>\n<p><strong>\u00e2\u0080\u008cBen:</strong> Yeah. I\u2019ve got this product, I\u2019m selling it to that customer. What kind of channel do I need to connect the two?</p>\n<p><strong>\u00e2\u0080\u008cAli:</strong> Yeah. In Databricks case, we take massive amounts of data and do machine learning on it. And if we improve by 1% some metric, that could mean a $100 million of improvements for some company. But that means we need to work with companies that have lots of data, and where 1% improvement matters a lot to them. That happens to be big enterprises. And the channel you need to talk to those are enterprise sales. And that\u2019s a different game than if you\u2019re selling to startups.</p>\n<p><strong>\u00e2\u0080\u008cBen:</strong> Yeah, it\u2019s amazing how many CEOs will make that mistake. And it always comes in the form of, well, you know, I don\u2019t want to hire a Rolex wearing salesperson or something like this. And it\u2019s like, well, because you don\u2019t like Rolexes? It\u2019s kind of like if I\u2019m taking a trip to Australia, and I\u2019d like to get there on a motorcycle. It\u2019s like, well, you can\u2019t get to Australia on a motorcycle.</p>\n<p><strong>\u00e2\u0080\u008cAli:</strong> I want to have really, really low CAC, customer acquisition costs. That\u2019s what I\u2019m going to go with. Who wouldn\u2019t? But maybe that doesn\u2019t get the job done for the product we have and for the market you\u2019re trying to reach?</p>\n<p><strong>For more\u2026</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://a16z.com/2019/01/30/enterprise-sales-levine-leslie-vets-valley\">a16z Podcast: Stories and Lessons in Enterprise Sales</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://a16z.com/2020/12/03/adding-top-down-sales-bottom-up-enterprise-startup\">The \u00e2\u0080\u009c$20M to $500M Question\u201d: When to Add Top Down Sales</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://a16z.com/2015/03/04/a16z-podcast-getting-sales-right\">a16z Podcast: Getting Sales Right</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://a16z.com/2019/02/02/product-market-sales-fit-product-go-to-market\">a16z Podcast: Product-Market Sales Fit (What Comes First?)</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>On the dynamics between sales and marketing, common reporting structures, and how to avoid finger-pointing (or, even, should you?)\u2026</h3>\n<p><strong>Ali:</strong> One thing that\u2019s weird [about that] is, actually, the finger pointing can be good. I actually always preferred not having a COO or someone between me and all these different functions reporting to me, because then I would actually find out what\u2019s going on. Like, the salesperson would say, \u201cHey, these leads are not great.\u201d And I would say, \u201cWhy not?\u201d And I could dig into it. And then the marketing leader would say, \u201cYeah, he says the leads are not great, but actually, they\u2019re not spending their time on the leads, because they\u2019re actually focusing on this other thing, which makes them more money right now.\u201d That helps you configure it.</p>\n<p>\u00e2\u0080\u008cNow, maybe you have an amazing leader that can do that instead of you, but that\u2019s a lot of power in someone\u2019s hands. And if you just started your company, and you get one COO, CRO that owns all of go-to-market, that\u2019s a lot of trust in one person. But more often than not, they probably don\u2019t understand your product as well. And they don\u2019t know what kind of company you\u2019re creating.</p>\n<p>\u00e2\u0080\u008c<strong>Marc:</strong> Yeah, the other thing that\u2019s really important to think about here is, basically, the two functions operate on very different clock cycles. Sales is typically executing against quarterly targets, and then ultimately, annual targets, and so forth. And marketing has some of those, but marketing generally is playing a longer game. They\u2019re trying to do long-term brand development and corporate communications. Sometimes lead gen plugs straight into sales, but they\u2019re doing a lot of other stuff that maybe is a little bit more amorphous, or high level around long-term demand creation.</p>\n<p>\u00e2\u0080\u008cAnd so the metaphor that gets used a lot is marketing is air war and sales is ground war. And it\u2019s a little bit like the Army and the Air Force. If you talk to Air Force officers, they may say, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI don\u2019t know why those guys are always running around with their boots in the ground\u2026 Why can\u2019t we just bomb from the air?\u00e2\u0080\u009d And the army guys are like, well, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthese Air Force guys, they\u2019re literally up in the clouds, and they actually don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on. They\u2019re not at the point of contact with the enemy.\u00e2\u0080\u009d</p>\n<p>\u00e2\u0080\u008cThere\u2019s a similar dynamic that can develop between marketing and sales, where the marketing people think the salespeople are kind of the grunts and the salespeople think the marketing people are just, like, out to lunch. It\u2019s a real cultural difference.</p>\n<p>\u00e2\u0080\u008cAnd so, they do naturally go together in the sense of there\u2019s a direct connection, which is they\u2019re all about go-to-market. But they also don\u2019t go together in these really important ways. I would say typically in a company, if marketing reports to sales, typically you have very weak marketing. If sales reports to marketing, typically you have no revenue. And then if they\u2019re peers, they generally argue a lot. And I think those might be the three choices.</p>\n<p>\u00e2\u0080\u008c<strong>Ali:</strong> And I agree if you put marketing under sales, and it\u2019s really sales driven, it\u2019s going to end up being very short term. Your sales leader will look at all this stuff marketing is doing, and they\u2019re going to only fund the stuff that is really guaranteed ROI in the short term. So, it ends up being lead gen, and programs, and events, and those things that immediately turn into revenue. They\u2019re not going to invest in the long term branding stuff that you need, and the thought leadership, and the things that over time actually are more important that you need to do.</p>\n<p><strong>For more\u2026</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://a16z.com/2020/07/29/growthsales-the-new-era-of-enterprise-go-to-market\">Growth+Sales: The New Era of Enterprise Go-to-Market</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://a16z.com/2018/12/11/bottom-up-adoption-enterprise-sales-combined\">On Combining Bottom-up Adoption and Enterprise Sales</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://a16z.com/2018/05/18/b2b2c-consumer-enterprise\">a16z Podcast: B2B2C</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://a16z.com/2018/02/24/category-creation-startups\">a16z Podcast: Creating a Category, from Pricing to Positioning</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://a16z.com/2017/06/09/go-to-market-pre-chasm-market-martin-casado\">Going to Market When No Market Exists</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n", "author": "a16z editorial"}, "12": {"podcast": "a16z Podcast: The New Fan Club\u2014Creators, Fans ... - Andreessen Horowitz", "url": "https://a16z.com/2020/09/18/a16z-podcast-new-fan-club-creators-fans-power-of-markets-crypto/", "contents": "a16z Podcast: The New Fan Club\u2014Creators, Fans, and the Power of Markets ( Crypto) by Kayvon Tehranian, Jesse Walden, and Zoran Basich Todays episode, part two in our two-part series on the Creator Economy, focuses on the new potential revenue streams and fan-engagement models opened up by emerging decentralized technology.", "crawled": true, "body": "\n<iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"200\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://player.simplecast.com/ab1524f5-5abd-46fd-ae0b-430f8000148b?dark=true\" title=\"The New Fan Club: Creators, Fans, and the Power of Markets (&amp; Crypto)\" width=\"100%\"></iframe><ul class=\"bio-lp-subscribe__apps\" data-podcast-src=\"https://a16z.simplecast.com/episodes/the-new-fan-club-creators-fans-and-the-power-of-markets-crypto?dark=true\"></ul><script>window.distribImages = {};window.distribChannels = [];window.distribImages[\"Apple Podcasts\"] = \"https://a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/bio-lp_apple-podcasts.png\";window.distribChannels.push(\"Apple Podcasts\");window.distribImages[\"Spotify\"] = \"https://a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/bio-lp_spotify.png\";window.distribChannels.push(\"Spotify\");window.distribImages[\"Stitcher\"] = \"https://a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Stitcher@2x.png\";window.distribChannels.push(\"Stitcher\");</script>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s episode, part two in our two-part series on the <a href=\"https://a16z.com/tag/creator-economies/\">Creator Economy</a>, focuses on the new potential revenue streams and fan-engagement models opened up by emerging decentralized technology. </span><span data-contrast=\"none\">It\u2019s a new type of fan club, driven by crypto networks and aiming to give creators more power in the commercial sphere. </span><span data-contrast=\"none\">We talked to two guests deeply immersed in these topics. </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Kayvon Tehranian is the founder and CEO of <a href=\"https://foundation.app/\">Foundation Labs</a>, a platform for buying and selling limited edition goods. Think of it as a crypto marketplace that creates new revenue streams for\u00c2\u00a0</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">creators</span><span data-contrast=\"none\">, and financial incentives for buyers. Before that he was head of product at cryptocurrencies marketplace Dharma Labs, and he has long worked on making crypto more accessible to the mainstream. </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Jesse Walden is a former a16z partner who recently launched his own fund, <a href=\"https://variant.fund/the-ownership-economy-crypto-and-consumer-software/\">Variant</a>, which focuses on what he calls the ownership economy enabled by crypto.

They also debate whether these new markets will largely be driven by financial motives, or whether cultural factors will be equally powerful in determining</span><span data-contrast=\"none\">\u00c2\u00a0</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">the growth of creator markets.</span><span data-contrast=\"none\"> And they offer advice to creators interested in exploring this new world, including important practical guidance on expectations and timelines.\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<h2>Transcript<span data-ccp-props=\"{}\">\u00c2\u00a0</span></h2>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\"><strong>Kayvon</strong>: There\u2019s now a movement to give these creators more power over the brands and the communities that they\u2019re inspiring or spearheading. In many ways, crypto is the next tool in their toolkit. It\u2019s a very</span><span data-contrast=\"none\">\u00c2\u00a0</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">nascent\u00c2\u00a0</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">technolog</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">y\u00c2\u00a0</span><span data-contrast=\"none\">and it has a lot of mental model complexity and just general complexity associated with it.\u00c2\u00a0</span><span data-contrast=\"none\">So</span><span data-contrast=\"none\">\u00c2\u00a0it hasn\u2019t been absorbed yet.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\">\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">But if you look at what it fundamentally unlocks for folks, it feels like one of those things that\u2019s inevitable. You have record labels or galleries or museums that are brokering a lot of what is considered valuable or how value gets transferred to these folks. And in reality, a lot of those players are going to be challenged by models where the creator can go to their fans or their community or their audience directly and create that economic relationship. That\u2019s going to enable them to potentially be more empowered to pursue their vision and</span><span data-contrast=\"none\">\u00c2\u00a0</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">not be</span><span data-contrast=\"none\">\u00c2\u00a0</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">brokering\u00c2\u00a0</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">deals</span><span data-contrast=\"none\">\u00c2\u00a0with folks that are intermediating the relationship between the audience and the creator.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\">\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\"><strong>Zoran</strong>: So crypto enables creators to bypass gatekeepers. Let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s talk about how that fits, Jesse, with what you call the ownership economy, where the definition of creators becomes very broad.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\">\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\"><strong>Jesse</strong>:</span><span data-contrast=\"none\">\u00c2\u00a0</span><span data-contrast=\"none\">So</span><span data-contrast=\"none\">\u00c2\u00a0you zoom out and look at the bigger picture. I think it\u2019s fair to say everyone who interacts with people online today is a creator in some form. Everyone is creating content in the form of Facebook posts, Instagram posts, blogs, newsletters, and so on. And that\u2019s a sort of a very natural evolution of how we use software on the internet. If you rewind the tape, one of the most surprising things about software in the age of the internet is the degree to which it\u2019s created by users or</span><span data-contrast=\"none\">\u00c2\u00a0</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">developers who write open-source code that\u2019s available for\u00c2\u00a0</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">anyone</span><span data-contrast=\"none\">\u00c2\u00a0</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">to consume.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\">\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">And what you\u2019re starting to see happen now, emanating from the crypto community, is the next logical step in this evolution. We\u2019re going from crowdsourcing code to crowdsourcing content and products that people create on internet platforms to crowdsourcing the actual operations of these internet platforms directly from users. And this has happened first in networks like Bitcoin and Ethereum, which are the first examples of networks that are entirely user-owned and operated. There is no company.\u00c2\u00a0There\u2019s\u00c2\u00a0just the users of the network running open-source code in order to provide a service that others in the network can use. And in exchange for the work that these users are doing, they\u2019re earning an actual ownership stake in the platform itself.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\">\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">So</span><span data-contrast=\"none\">\u00c2\u00a0this is an example where the creators of value are actually able to own more of the value, and that\u2019s what I call the ownership economy. And I think this idea is starting to move from more technical creators, like developers, to more mainstream or consumer-facing creators. And that\u2019s a pretty exciting idea because it means that creators on the internet, everyday people who use internet products and services, will be able to earn more of the value that they contribute to those products. That\u2019s because cryptocurrencies make it possible to distribute that value at internet scale instantly, to anyone, anywhere in the world. So that\u2019s sort of the fundamental technology\u00c2\u00a0</span><span data-contrast=\"none\">unlock</span><span data-contrast=\"none\">.\u00c2\u00a0</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\">\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">To make that more concrete, you know, one of the things that\u2019s worked really, really well in Silicon Valley has been giving early employees of new companies, new startups, stock option ownership. And that ownership is a very powerful incentive to get the top performance, the best talent to come and work at your company. To date, that\u2019s not been available to everyone because maybe they don\u2019t live in Silicon Valley, or they\u2019re not U.S. citizens and they can\u2019t be recipients of stock options as a result. Because stock options rely on this sort of legacy realm, there\u2019s sort of paper legal contracts written by lawyers. They\u2019re many pages long. It\u2019s expensive to administer them.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\">\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\"><strong>Zoran</strong>: And you have to be working for a company or investing in a company in order to receive them.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\">\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\"><strong>Jesse</strong>: Exactly. And crypto tokens take the same concept and sort of explode the accessibility to literally anyone with an internet connection that can contribute value to building a platform or service. They can earn a similar kind of ownership stake in the product or service that they\u2019re building, but they can do so without the friction of the legacy realm, without lawyers papering contracts. The same ideas can be expressed as code and transmitted over the wire in a standard that anyone can read and participate in.\u00c2\u00a0</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\">\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\"><strong>Zoran</strong>: Kayvon, you mentioned the various models there have been up until now for creators. They can try to get into retail. They can self-sell through, e-commerce sites or their own online shops. They can sell their work at galleries if they\u2019re visual artists. A lot of artists and creators have experimented with crowdfunding in recent years. So how is the crypto model different from crowdfunding?\u00c2\u00a0</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\">\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\"><strong>Kayvon</strong>: I think it\u2019s certainly evolving out of crowdfunding, but I think it\u2019s going into much broader cultural domains where releasing a record, releasing\u00c2\u00a0</span><span data-contrast=\"none\">a</span><span data-contrast=\"none\">\u00c2\u00a0art piece, coming up with an idea, they all can be encapsulated through tokens.\u00c2\u00a0</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\">\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">And\u00c2\u00a0</span><span data-contrast=\"none\">so</span><span data-contrast=\"none\">\u00c2\u00a0what we\u2019ve done or introduced is the ability for that token to fluctuate in price. And\u00c2\u00a0</span><span data-contrast=\"none\">so</span><span data-contrast=\"none\">\u00c2\u00a0the interesting thing here is, you can imagine ideas or products introduced by folks that go viral or do exceptionally well. And instead of it really being baked into this previous static crowdfunding campaign, it\u2019s a live market.\u00c2\u00a0</span><span data-contrast=\"none\">So</span><span data-contrast=\"none\">\u00c2\u00a0it can go up, it can go down. It\u2019s almost mimicking the stock market in some</span><span data-contrast=\"none\">\u00c2\u00a0</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">ways\u00c2\u00a0</span><span data-contrast=\"none\">where the market potential of the idea is uncapped. And\u00c2\u00a0</span><span data-contrast=\"none\">so</span><span data-contrast=\"none\">\u00c2\u00a0there\u2019s this price discovery aspect to it.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\">\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">That has pros and cons, right? Because on the other end of the spectrum, it also can go down. But I think what\u2019s interesting is you now have this beating heartbeat of the cultural realm that has a stock market-like component to it where products or ideas that are coming from brands and creators are tokenized and tradable and you can gauge the demand or interest or cultural relevancy in this new way.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\">\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">So</span><span data-contrast=\"none\">\u00c2\u00a0it fundamentally appeals to the early adopters, right?\u00c2\u00a0</span><span data-contrast=\"none\">So</span><span data-contrast=\"none\">\u00c2\u00a0if you\u2019re someone new to a trend or new to a creator or new to a product, there\u2019s actually a financial incentive now to that aspect, because you\u2019re getting in early and the price is lower. And then moreover, as the creator, these markets are something that you control as opposed to the non-crypto context where, when people are reselling things or people are creating markets around you, it\u2019s often not to your benefit. These are things that are happening after the fact. And crypto allows these creators to control that and capture that potential or capture that impact that they create.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\">\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\"><strong>Jesse</strong>: Kayvon touched on the idea of dynamic pricing in these markets, and I think that\u2019s something worth double-clicking on. So dynamic pricing essentially means there\u2019s a speculative element to participating in these markets. Just like the stock market, you make an investment on the hope and assumption that he\u00c2\u00a0price\u00c2\u00a0of the asset you\u2019re buying will appreciate in value. And that\u2019s not really been a model that\u2019s been adapted to the cultural realm before. I mean, it\u2019s obviously an element of art collecting. It\u2019s an element of collecting of any kind, whether sneakers or whatever, but you\u2019ve never had 24/7 global markets for cultural assets.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\">\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\"><strong>Zoran</strong>: Is there a tension between appealing to fans versus speculators? Because I can see two different types of people using a platform like this.\u00c2\u00a0</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\">\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\"><strong>Kayvon</strong>: I think there could be. Startups are just constantly in the business of exploring tensions and understanding what\u2019s tenable and what\u2019s not. You know, in my current thinking, in my current exposure, I think inviting speculation into the equation is a net positive and should actually allow creators to explore more wide-ranging ideas and have more mechanisms to bring more creativity into the world. I\u2019ve used speculation as positive where you really are allowing people to come in and take risks essentially in validating that.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\">\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Can that be pushed over the edge? Absolutely. But we have a ton of design affordances to fine-tune\u00c2\u00a0</span><span data-contrast=\"none\">that,s</span><span data-contrast=\"none\">\u00c2\u00a0o we\u2019re not by any means concerned. At least at this stage in the game, where we\u2019re not overwhelmed with demand and volume yet. This isn\u2019t rivaling these players that already exist in the billions of dollars. We\u2019re right now a fledgling project. And I think speculation is absolutely essential to getting it off the ground and to getting a lot of these creators off the ground. This isn\u2019t a platform for Jay-Z, or at least not yet. And\u00c2\u00a0</span><span data-contrast=\"none\">so</span><span data-contrast=\"none\">\u00c2\u00a0you\u2019re going to need to discover the new Jay-</span><span data-contrast=\"none\">Zs</span><span data-contrast=\"none\">\u00c2\u00a0and that takes risk and speculation.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\">\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">And\u00c2\u00a0</span><span data-contrast=\"none\">so</span><span data-contrast=\"none\">\u00c2\u00a0I don\u2019t think they\u2019re at tension at this point in time. Can there become a tension at some point? Sure. I would love that design challenge. It\u2019s really a matter of bumping into those realities and we haven\u2019t yet.\u00c2\u00a0</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\">\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\"><strong>Jesse</strong>: And I think what\u2019s interesting is if you look at crypto more broadly, and then zoom out another level to just innovation in general, you can find that speculation is often driver of lots of new waves of market activity and creativity.\u00c2\u00a0</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\">\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">But that speculation is not done in vain, in that the speculation drives more innovation and drives infrastructure development. So other creators, other innovators see the money rushing in, they too jump in, and the progress accelerates. And\u00c2\u00a0</span><span data-contrast=\"none\">so</span><span data-contrast=\"none\">\u00c2\u00a0speculation can actually be really useful in driving new markets to maturity. And this is not something that has been made accessible to creators before, this model of injecting speculative cap, financial capital into real production capital.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\">\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\"><strong>Zoran</strong>: Yeah.\u00c2\u00a0</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Chris Dixon and Eddy\u00c2\u00a0</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Lazzarin</span><span data-contrast=\"none\">\u00c2\u00a0</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">talked</span><span data-contrast=\"none\">\u00c2\u00a0about the <a href=\"https://a16z.com/2020/05/15/the-crypto-price-innovation-cycle/\">crypto price innovation cycle</a> \u00e2\u0080\u0094 prices go up, speculators jump in, hype goes through the roof, and then the prices go down. But in the meantime, all these people have entered the space and started figuring things out and getting ideas, and that tends to sustain over time, even as the prices go up and down.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\">\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\"><strong>Kayvon</strong>: And I think the same will be true with creators. Creators issuing tokens will go through the same thing. We\u2019ve had markets go up, they go down, but then they\u2019re\u2026 if the creator is really pushing them and really seeing them through, they, kind of, recover and then they consistently take off. And I think that it\u2019s cool to see this in a microcosm where that one principle applies to\u00c2\u00a0</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">everything\u00c2\u00a0</span><span data-contrast=\"none\">from the product development to the creator markets, to the creator tokens, to our even long-term roadmap.\u00c2\u00a0</span><span data-contrast=\"none\">So</span><span data-contrast=\"none\">\u00c2\u00a0it\u2019s certainly a fundamental tenet to pay attention to or to pay heed to.\u00c2\u00a0</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\">\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\"><strong>Zoran</strong>: There\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been lots of attempts in the past to find new ways of monetization and fan engagement. What\u00e2\u0080\u0099s different today?</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\">\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\"><strong>Jesse</strong>: Back when I started\u00c2\u00a0</span><span data-contrast=\"none\">Mediachain</span><span data-contrast=\"none\">\u00c2\u00a0in 2014, the idea that any creator would be able to mint their own token and have a trade on a 24/7 global marketplace was kind of\u00c2\u00a0</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">unfathomable\u00c2\u00a0</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">because Ethereum didn\u2019t exist at that time. And\u00c2\u00a0</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">so</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">\u00c2\u00a0in order to create a digital token, you have to\u00c2\u00a0</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">bootstrap\u00c2\u00a0</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">an entire network of miners, like Bitcoin had done, and that was the far</span><span data-contrast=\"none\">\u00c2\u00a0more challenging or daunting task than it is to mint a token on top of an existing blockchain like Ethereum.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\">\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">So</span><span data-contrast=\"none\">\u00c2\u00a0I think that technically the infrastructure to support a lot of the ideas of\u00c2\u00a0</span><span data-contrast=\"none\">Mediachain</span><span data-contrast=\"none\">\u00c2\u00a0is there today. And not just technical infrastructure, also market infrastructure. You know,\u00c2\u00a0</span><span data-contrast=\"none\">stablecoins</span><span data-contrast=\"none\">\u00c2\u00a0have enabled people to transact in these markets in a medium of exchange that they understand, dollars. The ability to abstract private key management from end users so that the experience of participating in these markets rivals any Web 2.0 platform that also exists today, that didn\u2019t exist back then.\u00c2\u00a0</span><span data-contrast=\"none\">So</span><span data-contrast=\"none\">\u00c2\u00a0there\u2019s a lot of factors that make now the right time to realize this idea of the universal media library where creators are more valued. And I do think it will be driven by markets first.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\">\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\"><strong>Kayvon</strong>: We are very, very early in this development and creators are coming with very, very rough mental models of how it works. They know it\u2019s powerful. They know they want this. They know it\u2019s the future. But there is still a lot of education and collaboration necessary.\u00c2\u00a0</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\">\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">And then the one thing I would add as well is, we\u2019re also in an unprecedented time right now, where artists are being challenged or creators are being challenged on so many fronts. And the IRL world is shut down in so many different ways. And technology is more and more and more part of these people\u2019s lives. And this is the first technology that, kind of\u2026 if the mp3 was this file format that unlocked ubiquitous access to a creator\u2019s work, it did nothing for the monetization in some ways, because it created ubiquitous supply. Tokens do the opposite where they restrict the supply and create a provenance that is then provable, that then creates powerful economic forces that actually then funnel into the creator.\u00c2\u00a0So\u00c2\u00a0it\u2019s almost this necessary and second wave of technology where now that the creators\u2019 work can be transmitted all over the internet at a fraction of a penny, there\u2019s now a way for these folks to express their work in a way that then actually holds on to value, as opposed to seeing it go down in marginal cost to zero.\u00c2\u00a0</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\">\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">That being said, that\u2019s the beginning, in my opinion, right? The future of ideas is vast.\u00c2\u00a0</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\">\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\"><strong>Zoran</strong>: There\u2019s so many interesting things about this. The idea that someone can get in early and purchase this token that represents a creator\u2019s work and that token may rise in value \u00e2\u0080\u0094 that creates all kinds of incentives for the person who\u2019s purchased the token to become an evangelist, to become a fan, to become a\u00c2\u00a0</span><span data-contrast=\"none\">passionat</span><span data-contrast=\"none\">, marketer of this creator. What are the implications of that?\u00c2\u00a0</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\">\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\"><strong>Jesse</strong>:\u00c2\u00a0</span><span data-contrast=\"none\">The move to independent direct fan-audience relationship, I think, is naturally going to evolve to one that is more financial in nature, where you\u2019re not just backing a creator just simply to get access but also for potential upside. And that may sound, initially, a little bit off, right, because profit maximization is not the sole reason you want to back or support a creator. But I think what will come to be understood about this model is that when you do have exposure to the upside, it can be a very powerful catalyst for new kinds of engagement, where your fans are not just passive consumers or a passive audience, but actively involved in the creation process in some way. And for some creators, that will be unwelcome, but for others that lean into it, it\u2019s a pretty powerful new tool for building community, building audience, and, ultimately, monetizing. A simpler way of saying it is that it\u2019s sort of the new fan club, where instead of just being a member you\u2019re exposed to the upside as well.\u00c2\u00a0</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\">\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\"><strong>Kayvon</strong>: I think it\u2019s very, very unexplored, because I will tell you right now, we have 20-plus markets live on Foundation right now. And I think if there\u2019s plenty of education on the creator side to on-ramp into this world, there\u2019s commensurate education on the buyer\u2019s side. And the idea that people have fluency in how this all works and why it\u2019s\u00c2\u00a0</span><span data-contrast=\"none\">good</span><span data-contrast=\"none\">\u00c2\u00a0and they\u2019re aware of what they\u2019re doing, that\u2019s not there yet.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\">\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">For the most part,\u00c2\u00a0</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">people are</span><span data-contrast=\"none\">\u00c2\u00a0</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">playing.</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">\u00c2\u00a0We do have a good portion of our audience that\u2019s already crypto-savvy, they understand that a token that\u2019s dynamically priced is going to have a good price early on and they\u2019re ready to go. But as we increase the number of markets, we increase the number of creators, that\u00c2\u00a0</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">audience\u00c2\u00a0</span><span data-contrast=\"none\">is small. And so, you\u2019re going to need to expand the size of the population that understands what\u2019s happening here and what tokens can do and what they are doing. It\u2019s in the soup right now of figuring that out.\u00c2\u00a0</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\">\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">And\u00c2\u00a0</span><span data-contrast=\"none\">so</span><span data-contrast=\"none\">\u00c2\u00a0I would just go as far as to say it\u2019s very, very unexplored and it\u2019s very, very misunderstood. It\u2019s not something that\u2019s a fluency outside of, I would say, the core crypto audience. But I think the opportunity is actually about the much larger cultural realm that exists outside of crypto, that actually needs to come in and adopt this technology, that\u2019s going to benefit what they\u2019re already doing outside of it.\u00c2\u00a0</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\">\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\"><strong>Jesse</strong>: There\u2019s this expression I picked up, the expression is, \u201cYou should invest in what\u2019s in the fridge.\u201d So that is, products you actually consume and eat, because you know those products, you understand the quality and it essentially assumes that your taste is good enough to judge whether a product will continue to succeed and whether other people will like it as well.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\">\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">And I think that the dynamic there, if you invest in what\u2019s in the fridge is, you go from being a mere consumer, to being someone who has a vested interest in the success of the product that you\u2019re purchasing. And that can be a pretty powerful driver of a behavior shift, where you become more loyal. You won\u2019t purchase any other product. You\u2019ll evangelize the product to your friends. You start to play an active role in the success of that brand or company.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\">\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">And I</span><span data-contrast=\"none\">\u00c2\u00a0think what Foundation markets enable is for any fan or anyone who appreciates a creator\u2019s work to take that leap beyond just, you know, backing a creator out of goodwill or subscribing to them on a monthly basis, they can actually invest in what\u2019s in the\u00c2\u00a0</span><span data-contrast=\"none\">fridge, so to speak. They can put money behind the creator in a way that can benefit them directly. And that self-interest, whether it\u2019s purely financial or not, I think, can be a powerful driver of more engagement or a new relationship between creators an</span><span data-contrast=\"none\">d their audience.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\">\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\"><strong>Kayvon</strong>: I actually think this won\u2019t start just from a purely financial perspective. If you look at all of these cultural powerhouses, you know, if we go into Supreme, the brand, we go to Basquiat, we go to Chance the Rapper \u2026 you can really throw out any cult figure that rose from a very, very small audience initially. There is this now ability for those people to have participated in a way that then allows them to, like, map the financial outcome that happens when they become big and they take over.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\">\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">And by the way, that\u2019s how culture works. You don\u2019t know what\u2019s coming next. And it\u2019s really interesting to, kind of, create this now mechanism where the early folks and the creator have a tool that\u2019s automatically creating these alignments without them needing to think it through. The chance that it does become the next big thing is low, right? It\u2019s, like, I don\u2019t think you would really hang out with, you know, that early on in a lot of these contexts without, like, a real connection. And it\u2019s cool now to bring that financial aspect to it because a lot of these people weren\u2019t there for that reason. And\u00c2\u00a0</span><span data-contrast=\"none\">so</span><span data-contrast=\"none\">\u00c2\u00a0they weren\u2019t looking out for that upside. And if we can bring that in just naturally so it works that way, those people actually end up empowered.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\">\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\"><strong>Zoran</strong>: I wonder if there\u2019s a Big Bang moment for crypto, as it regards, like, creator economies, like, some huge star, you know, decides to take a chance or to experiment with this and put out a limited edition set of\u00c2\u00a0</span><span data-contrast=\"none\">artwork</span><span data-contrast=\"none\">\u00c2\u00a0or whatever it happens to be.\u00c2\u00a0</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\">\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\"><strong>Kayvon</strong>: I\u2019m skeptical of that. I don\u2019t know if I buy into that. I think crypto has already had that many times over now, where Floyd Mayweather comes in, you know, gets in on the ICO boom, Paris Hilton has been in the headlines for doing some crypto art. You know, I think these things are pretty one-off. And I think the culture at large is rightly skeptical to not over-index on them. I mean, are they a scam? Are they just the way to make money? What\u2019s the real thing?</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\">\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">I think this is much more subtle, where you actually really start to work with creators who are stuck in this, kind of, halfway state where they have these enormous audiences, but they don\u2019t know how to monetize because they don\u2019t have the right tool. And one by one, they start to realize that crypto is giving them really solid revenue streams in a way that they just can\u2019t get elsewhere.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\">\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">And that\u2019s not an overnight change. That\u2019s going to be one creator, five creators, 10 creators seeing real revenue that they\u2019re, all of a sudden, really running their lives off of, and then they\u2019re doing it over and over again, and\u00c2\u00a0</span><span data-contrast=\"none\">they\u2019re</span><span data-contrast=\"none\">, kind of, you know, high NPS score, sharing that with other folks who are in the same camp, those folks seeing, \u201cOh, it works for them too,\u201d</span><span data-contrast=\"none\">\u00c2\u00a0</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">right</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">? Where then, all of a sudden, it becomes actually an authentic, \u201cOh, this actually</span><span data-contrast=\"none\">\u00c2\u00a0</span><span data-contrast=\"none\">is solving a problem for a set of people.\u201d</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\">\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">If you come in and you\u2019re already high profile, the chances of you needing to monetize in a new way are not that pressing, right? If you\u2019re anyone in those camps, I promise you, you have probably more offers coming in than you can deal with.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\">\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">But there is this creator cohort that is using these platforms and doing meaningful work, but they haven\u2019t reached that level of stardom. And if they prove out the technology, there\u2019ll be a flywheel there. And I don\u2019t think that\u2019s overnight.\u00c2\u00a0</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\">\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\"><strong>Zoran</strong>: You know, the people who have made a lot of money in crypto, up until now, have been people who were, kind of, very technically savvy or able to, kind of, take advantage of opportunities. You know, currently, you\u2019re seeing things, like, yield farming, etc., which is, you know, technically code is transparent and open, but it\u2019s really not accessible for most people. And one of the challenges of crypto is to become more accessible, easier to use and benefit from.\u00c2\u00a0</span><span data-ccp-props='{\"335551550\":1,\"335551620\":1,\"335559740\":259}'>\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\"><strong>Kayvon</strong>: Absolutely. You heard from Jesse, from\u00c2\u00a0</span><span data-contrast=\"none\">Mediachain\u2019s</span><span data-contrast=\"none\">\u00c2\u00a0perspective of 2014, what we have at our disposal is rocket science. It\u2019s unbelievable that we can have this platform, that we don\u2019t have to spin up miners. We can just have tokens and they get issued. We have the ability to give you a key to interact with the blockchain and you don\u2019t have to have this complex key management strategy on your end that, you know, you\u2019re writing down your passphrases and storing them all over your house. Real people don\u2019t want to do that. And\u00c2\u00a0</span><span data-contrast=\"none\">so</span><span data-contrast=\"none\">\u00c2\u00a0we have a lot of these building blocks.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\">\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">That being said, they\u2019re still rough. And no one has put them together in an aesthetic and experience, in a UX that feels right. You\u2019re, like, okay, cool. Just using the technology. I\u2019m not wading through a textbook on cryptography, which is how I think a lot of people feel, even just doing basic transaction signing in other contexts. I think if you really are talking to creators more broadly \u00e2\u0080\u0094 not the ones that are perhaps\u00c2\u00a0</span><span data-contrast=\"none\">geeking</span><span data-contrast=\"none\">\u00c2\u00a0out on crypto technology \u00e2\u0080\u0094they\u2019re not here to obsess over cryptography. They\u2019re not here to read the manual. They want something that helps them in their work, and their work is not the blockchain. And\u00c2\u00a0so\u00c2\u00a0we have to democratize to actually unlock this future because it\u2019s not realistic to expect artists crossing every vertical.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\">\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">I mean, like, let\u2019s take\u00c2\u00a0</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">fashion</span><span data-contrast=\"none\">, for example. Why would you want to understand key management in detail and mining in\u00c2\u00a0</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">detail\u00c2\u00a0</span><span data-contrast=\"none\">if you\u2019re building a fashion line or you\u2019re building a fashion house. These are not\u00c2\u00a0diagrams\u00c2\u00a0that make sense. We want you to be obsessed about what you\u2019re creating and the value that you\u2019re adding in that domain, and we\u2019re going to go build and obsess over the technology to the point where you just find it useful.\u00c2\u00a0</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\">\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\"><strong>Jesse</strong>: I would add here that I think the adoption of crypto is following a familiar pattern for the adoption of new technology platforms, where very often, they start out first being adopted by developers, people who are technologists, people understand the new platform at a very technical level. And then, the next phase of adoption is generally by financiers or people who are getting involved more from a speculative point of view. And I think that\u2019s been true of crypto, and maybe to a bigger degree than other technology platforms, because crypto is a finance innovation. And so not only do we have the general public speculating, we have pretty sophisticated financial actors, Wall Street types, hedge fund types, getting involved with new financial marketplaces that are being built on top of these new\u00c2\u00a0</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">rails</span><span data-contrast=\"none\">. And that, when you referred to yield farming earlier, you know, I think that\u2019s one example of what I\u2019m describing where you have pretty sophisticated financial types working with these new marketplaces in order to earn or maximize their profits.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\">\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">And none of this is intelligible to anyone who is accustomed to using everyday Web 2.0 products, like Airbnb and Uber and stuff like that. It\u2019s still very much in the early adopter phase. But slowly but surely, you\u2019re starting to see the next wave of adoption play out and that\u2019s adoption beyond developers, beyond, you know, financiers, adoption by real consumers. Reddit is running this great experiment right now where every Reddit user has an Ethereum wallet in the mobile app. They don\u2019t need to know that it\u2019s an Ethereum wallet. All that they need to know is that they\u2019re able to earn tokens or earn community currencies, I think is what Reddit calls them, in exchange for contributions they make to the platform, for example, moderating content or uploading content.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\">\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">You have a whole ecosystem of companies and founders taking the building blocks that others have built before them and, sort of, making them more accessible to a consumer audience. And that\u2019s pretty typical for any new technology platform.\u00c2\u00a0</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\">\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\"><strong>Zoran</strong>: There\u2019s so much that\u2019s, kind of, in flux, in developing, where do you see this going in the next 5 to 10 years? Are we moving toward decentralized autonomous organizations, or DAOs, where it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s essentially run entirely or almost entirely by code?\u00c2\u00a0</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\">\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\"><strong>Kayvon</strong>: I think everything in Ethereum, when you introduce a token the DAO is\u2026 I do think, like, the natural end state for basically anything that goes on in Ethereum. Because essentially what you do is you eventually introduce a token into whatever value-added activity is going on. And you say, \u201cCool, if you\u2019re wanting to be involved with this, you need to hold this token.\u201d And that aligns incentives because the token goes up in value, just some of the shares in a company, you\u2019re all trying to, like, make this thing more valuable. And it\u2019s just a very fundamental human behavior.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\">\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">But what happens when you can enable that for everything and everyone, right? And\u00c2\u00a0</span><span data-contrast=\"none\">so</span><span data-contrast=\"none\">\u00c2\u00a0what I think you end up with is a world in which every brand, every creator that is doing serious volume is themselves a DAO and has token holders that are weighing in and a stakeholder. And\u00c2\u00a0</span><span data-contrast=\"none\">so</span><span data-contrast=\"none\">\u00c2\u00a0it\u2019s a pretty cool sci-fi future that I think it\u2019s not coming down in the next year. I just want to set expectations. People are already exploring though this idea. They\u2019re already issuing tokens. It\u2019s only a few steps or leaps from there to end up in that future. Again, it feels to us, like, a further afield future, but one that\u2019s inevitable.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\">\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">What happens when, let\u2019s take a fashion label, like Supreme, is a DAO, where all the people that participate in that brand own it in some way. And\u00c2\u00a0</span><span data-contrast=\"none\">so</span><span data-contrast=\"none\">\u00c2\u00a0while, you know, it would be difficult to create these communities before, the software is going to enable many, many, many, many more communities to exist that wouldn\u2019t be able to otherwise.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\">\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">I think of it as the alternative to an IPO in, kind of, the future where this is the future version of the IPO where you can essentially, you know, you start off centralized and then you\u2019re decentralizing through the token. And instead of it being through the centralized New York Stock Exchange or the existing IPO paradigm, you\u2019re doing it through a very internet-native way. And I think that that\u2019s going to be a very, very powerful model that\u2019s proven out again in that 10-year timeframe.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\">\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\"><strong>Jesse</strong>: There\u2019s a few things I\u2019ll say about that. One is, I authored this post as a playbook for entrepreneurs building in the space on <a href=\"https://a16z.com/2020/01/09/progressive-decentralization-crypto-product-management/\">progressive decentralization</a>\u00c2\u00a0</span><span data-contrast=\"none\">wherein</span><span data-contrast=\"none\">\u00c2\u00a0I advocate for a three-step process to making ownership a keystone of your product experience. First, you have to have a product that people want in the first place. You can\u2019t just put out a token and expect that it\u2019s going to blow up overnight and you\u2019re going to be rich and famous. You have to build something of value first. And once you have that, whether it\u2019s a painting or it\u2019s an internet platform that people are using, you can then start to invite your users to come in and take ownership of that. And the way to effectuate that distribution of ownership is likely by producing a token and giving it to your users or letting them buy it. But it has to be done in that order. If you do it out of order and you start by having a token with nothing tied to it, no product that people want, you\u2019re not going to get very far. You\u2019re going to get hype. Maybe you\u2019ll get hyped. And then it will fizzle out and you\u2019ll be left with a ghost town community that was just there for the pump and the dump.\u00c2\u00a0</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\">\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\"><strong>Zoran</strong>: If there\u2019s a creator out there who feels stuck and is interested in exploring new monetization opportunities, what would you say to them to make them consider a platform like yours?\u00c2\u00a0</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\">\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\"><strong>Kayvon</strong>:</span><span data-contrast=\"none\">\u00c2\u00a0</span><span data-contrast=\"none\">I would lower the stakes. I think people come to blockchain and crypto and they go to Level 1000 on their expectations and their own expectations of themselves. And they say, \u201cIf I\u2019m going to issue my own cryptocurrency, it\u2019s got to have this and this and this and this.\u201d If you even think about software, as soon as you make something too complex, it becomes impossible to ship.\u00c2\u00a0</span><span data-contrast=\"none\">So</span><span data-contrast=\"none\">\u00c2\u00a0come to the table with something really concrete, something that\u2019s small, that gets you started, you\u2019ll be surprised at how flexible the models are. And we\u2019re more in the business of getting people started. Every single creator that\u2019s worked with us so far is already onto their next drop. They\u2019re already thinking about what they\u2019re going to do next. And that\u2019s actually the signal to us.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\">\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">The ambitions can be huge, but let\u2019s get something going now and today. There\u2019s nothing stopping you from having your own market tomorrow.\u00c2\u00a0</span><span data-contrast=\"none\">So</span><span data-contrast=\"none\">\u00c2\u00a0start small, start humble and come and play and explore. And then what you\u2019ll find is that you\u2019ll come up with your next couple of ideas and that\u2019s the trajectory that you want to be on.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\">\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\"><strong>Zoran</strong>:\u00c2\u00a0</span><span data-contrast=\"none\">So</span><span data-contrast=\"none\">\u00c2\u00a0it will be a process for creators as well. It\u2019s not like, \u201cI\u2019m going to get rich right away and find this magical solution that brings me thousands or millions of dollars.\u201d</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\">\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\"><strong>Kayvon</strong>: Correct. Oh God. Yeah. And the pressure that comes from that is just so unproductive for creativity. The idea that you know the idea that\u2019s already going to make you a million dollars on your market is not going to be available to you tomorrow. It\u2019s going to be available to you in the coming years, and today\u2019s the day to start figuring that out. Our product, to us, is incredibly still undeveloped relative to what it can do. And\u00c2\u00a0</span><span data-contrast=\"none\">so</span><span data-contrast=\"none\">\u00c2\u00a0we\u2019re trying to be an authentic ambassador of that message. Like, don\u2019t come to the table with your million-dollar token yet. It\u2019s probably not going to happen. But there are plenty of other ideas that really can get you started right now.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\">\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\"><strong>Zoran</strong>: I don\u2019t know. This anti-hype model you have going on is just so non-crypto. It\u2019s kind of hard for me to get my head around.\u00c2\u00a0</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\">\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\"><strong>Kayvon</strong>: I know, I know. If anything, I would want people to take away, we\u2019re long-term focused. And if you\u2019re all hyped and you\u2019re all, \u201cIt\u2019s got to go up tomorrow,\u201d you\u2019ll find out how quickly you burn out. And if anything, the teams that have done exceptionally well in crypto have been able to live in a context that\u2019s all hype and just consistently deliver solid, solid products that actually incrementally are adding value. And you\u2019d be surprised how far that gets you over a two, three-year timeline.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\">\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\"><strong>Jesse</strong>: I would add that there\u2019s also a very strong community and market waiting to receive you there. People who are in crypto today are very excited to see mainstream creators jump in and are pretty welcoming in getting people off the learning curve. I think it\u2019s right to come in with a sort of a playful and open mind. But then realize that there is real potential and real money to be made by trying out these new models because the crypto community, many people in it have been around for a long time. They\u2019ve been through a number of cycles, of ups and downs. They\u2019re ready and excited to see the next wave of adaption happen. So, I think you\u2019ll find that there\u2019s a lot of support waiting for you when you jump in.\u00c2\u00a0</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\">\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\"><strong>Zoran</strong>: Thanks, appreciate your time.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\">\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\"><strong>Jesse</strong>: Thanks for having me.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\">\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\"><strong>Kayvon</strong>: Talk to you soon.\u00c2\u00a0</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\">\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\">***</span></p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The views expressed here are those of the individual AH Capital Management, L.L.C.

Koerner.</strong> \u00e2\u0080\u009cBetween 1961 and 1972, 159 commercial flights were hijacked in the US. This book is a non-fiction account of early days of plane commercialization, and the countless hijackings that occurred. It took the FAA over 10 years to implement and require metal detectors, as they thought that would slow down airport check-ins, and could not foresee hijacking as a means to injure others. Fascinating on all accounts.\u00e2\u0080\u009d</p>\n<p><strong><em>Spring Chicken: Stay Young Forever (or Die Trying)</em> by Bill Gifford.</strong> \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a dive into research on aging, and how to slow down the process. It is surprisingly humorous as the author employs some self deprecation as a mid-40s man who isn\u2019t in the best shape. It\u2019s fascinating to understand what\u2019s proven (intermittent fasting, cold water plunges) and what really isn\u2019t (calorie restriction) as it relates to slowing down aging.\u00e2\u0080\u009d</p>\n<h5>\u2026from Parker Brown, market development team:</h5>\n<p><strong><em>Shoe Dog: A Memoir</em> by Phil Knight.</strong> \u00e2\u0080\u009cAmazing story of how Knight built the most iconic sports brand in the world from his parent\u2019s garage with a $50 loan from his father.\u00e2\u0080\u009d</p>\n<h5><img alt=\"hhawk\" class=\"alignright wp-image-16973 size-medium\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"300\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/hhawk.jpg?resize=188%2C300&amp;ssl=1\" width=\"188\"/>\u2026from LeeAnn Caballero, events (marketing team):</h5>\n<p><strong><em>H is for Hawk</em> by Helen Macdonald.</strong> \u00e2\u0080\u009cPoetic and heartbreaking.

(And listen to the soundtrack, and the mixtape, and read his letters.) But the biography is astounding in its parallels to today: For instance, the scenes where Hamilton and Burr exchange letters before their duel reminded me so much of the relationships between media, PR, and social media (via letters vs. blog posts/tweets). Hamilton was also the ultimate immigrant, who \u2018rose up\u2019 but then also literally \u2018threw away his shot\u2019 in what has proven to be the long<em>est</em> game ever. And\u00c2\u00a0he was the ultimate startup founder, with an incredible combo of grand vision +\u00c2\u00a0mundane execution: He spent more time his first year as Treasury Secretary writing letters about lighthouses than anything else since trade was such a huge source of revenue for the nascent economy.\u201d</p>\n<p><strong><em><img alt=\"bookemotions\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-16996\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"300\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/bookemotions.jpg?resize=200%2C300&amp;ssl=1\" width=\"200\"/>The Book of Human Emotions</em> by Tiffany Watt Smith.</strong> \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf you believe words shape our thoughts (and vice versa), then they should shape our feelings (and understanding of those feelings), too!

Really, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the PC that has the limited, cut-down version of the internet.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2015/9/1/forget-about-mobile-internet\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Forget about the mobile internet</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2015/5/14/mobile-first\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Mobile first</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2015/8/10/what-would-you-miss\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">What would you miss?</a></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h5>3: Mobile isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t about small screens and PCs aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t about keyboards \u2013 mobile means an ecosystem and that ecosystem will swallow \u00e2\u0080\u0098PCs\u00e2\u0080\u0099</h5>\n<p>When we say \u2018mobile\u2019 we don\u2019t mean mobile, just as when we said \u2018PCs\u2019 we didn\u2019t mean \u00e2\u0080\u0098personal\u00e2\u0080\u0099. \u00e2\u0080\u0098Mobile\u00e2\u0080\u0099 isn\u2019t about the screen size or keyboard or location or use. Rather, the ecosystem of ARM, iOS and Android, with 10x the scale of \u00e2\u0080\u0098Wintel\u00e2\u0080\u0099, will become the new centre of gravity throughout computing.\u00c2\u00a0This means that \u00e2\u0080\u0098mobile\u00e2\u0080\u0099 devices will take over more and more of what we use \u00e2\u0080\u0098PCs\u00e2\u0080\u0099 for, gaining larger screens and keyboards, sometimes, and more and more powerful software, all driven by the irresistible force of a much larger ecosystem, which will suck in all of the investment and innovation.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2015/11/7/mobile-ecosystems-and-the-death-of-pcs\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Mobile, ecosystems and the death of PCs</a></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h5>4: The future of productivity</h5>\n<p>Will you always need a mouse and keyboard and Excel or Powerpoint for \u00e2\u0080\u0098real work\u00e2\u0080\u0099? Probably not \u2013 those will linger on for a long time for tens of millions of core users, but not the other billions \u2013 computing and productivity has changed radically before and will change again. Big screens will last, for some, and maybe keyboards, for some, but all the software will change. It will move to the cloud, and onto mobile devices (with large or small screens), and be reshaped by them. The core question \u2013 is typing, or making presentations, actually your job, or just a tool you use to get your actual job done? What matters is the connective tissue of a company \u2013 the verbs that move things along.

Xbox is non-core, Windows Mobile is on life support, Windows 10 is a good prop for the legacy business that can slow but not prevent this change, and Satya Nadella has explicitly stated that the decades-old strategy of \u00e2\u0080\u0098Windows Everywhere\u00e2\u0080\u0099 \u2013 of trying to be the universal platform \u2013 is over. That doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t remotely mean that Microsoft is dead, but it has to work out how to use the cash and market position of the old monopolies to help it build new businesses. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a big change from the past, where everything was about building Windows and Office. But it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not quite clear what those new businesses will look like \u2013 Microsoft has to try to reinvent the connective tissue of the enterprise.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2015/7/8/capitulation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Microsoft, capitulation and the end of Windows Everywhere</a></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h5>6: Apple &amp; Google both won, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s complicated</h5>\n<p>The mobile generation is unusual in that we seem to have two winners \u2013 both Apple and Google won, in different ways. Conventionally, the bigger ecosystem wins and sucks all activity into its orbit, but Apple\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ecosystem has perhaps 800m active users, far larger than in previous generations, and has perhaps half of global mobile browsing and two thirds or more of app store revenue (a good proxy for overall economic activity). Android has more users but Apple has more of the \u00e2\u0080\u0098best\u00e2\u0080\u0099 users (from a developers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 perspective).</p>\n<p>Indeed, one can also ask whether Google rather than Apple has a problem \u2013 Google\u00e2\u0080\u0099s existential need is reach, and both iOS and Android give it reach, but the reach it has on iOS is limited by what Apple will allow. And less than a quarter of iPhone users have bothered to install Google Maps.\u00c2\u00a0 Conversely, Apple\u00e2\u0080\u0099s weakness in cloud services and AI may end up becoming an equivalent strategic problem over time.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2014/1/28/ecosystem-maths\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Ecosystem Maths</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2014/10/14/how-many-ecosystems\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">How many ecosystems?</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2015/4/14/what-does-google-need-on-mobile\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">What does Google need in mobile?</a></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h5>7: Search and discovery</h5>\n<p>The internet makes it possible to get anything you\u2019ve ever heard of, but also makes it impossible to have heard of everything. It allows anyone to be heard, but how do people hear of you? We started with browsing, and that didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t scale to the internet, and then we moved to search, but search can only give you what you already knew you wanted. In the past, print and retail showed us what there was but also gave us a filter \u2013 now both the filter and the demand generation are gone. So, who has the traffic, and where do they send it? How do AI, or discovery, or the platforms themselves fit into this? \u00c2\u00a0How much curation, and where?\u00c2\u00a0How do you get users?</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2015/6/24/search-discovery-and-marketing\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Search, discovery and marketing</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2015/7/16/google-now-maps-and-apple-music\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Google Now, Maps and Apple Music</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2015/9/14/distribution-and-audience\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Platforms, distribution and audience</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2015/11/15/bay-area-problems\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Bay Area problems</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2015/9/26/mobile-is-not-a-neutral-platform\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Mobile is not a neutral platform</a></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h5>8: Apps and the web</h5>\n<p>There\u2019s an involved, technical, and (for people like me) fascinating conversation in tech about smartphone apps and the web \u2013 what can each do, how discovery works, how they interplay, what Google plans with Chrome, whether the web will take over as the dominant form \u2026 and so on. But for an actual brand, developer or publisher wondering if they should do an app or a website, the calculation is much simpler and less technical: \u00e2\u0080\u0098Do people want to put your icon on their home screen?\u00e2\u0080\u0099</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2015/5/14/apps-versus-the-web\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Apps versus the web</a></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h5>9: Post Netscape, post PageRank, looking for the next run-time</h5>\n<p>For 15 years the internet was a monolith: web browser + mouse + keyboard. There were options, but for most normal consumers the web and the internet were practically the same thing. The smartphone broke that apart, but we haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t settled on a new model. Competition between Apple and Google, with Facebook trying to butt in, plus all the unrealised possibilities of a new medium, means the interaction models of mobile keep changing. Really, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re looking for a new run-time \u2013 a new way, after the web and native apps, to build services. That might be Siri or Now or messaging or maps or notifications or something else again. But the underlying aim is to construct a new search and discovery model \u2013 a new way, different from the web or app stores, to get users.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2015/5/14/apps-versus-the-web\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Apps versus the web</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2014/8/1/app-unbundling-search-and-discovery\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">App unbundling, search and discovery\u00c2\u00a0</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2015/9/26/mobile-is-not-a-neutral-platform\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Mobile is not a neutral platform</a></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h5>10: Messaging as a platform, and a way to get customers</h5>\n<p>A big part of this hunt for a new runtime, and a new discovery layer, is messaging. Facebook almost built this on the desktop and WeChat has managed to build it on mobile in China. By turning messaging into a development environment, you create an alternative to the web or the app store, but without the binary installation problem of apps (\u00e2\u0080\u0098is it installed or not?\u00e2\u0080\u0099) and with your own new discovery and user acquisition platform. An important strand of this is unbundling services \u2013 you unbundle content from apps into messaging (or notifications) and you also unbundle messages from websites (via email or apps) into your messaging platform, turning it into the new connective tissue of your phone. At least, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the idea.</p>\n<p>Facebook and a few others want to do this outside China, but haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t managed yet (and building layers onto the OS is tough for anyone other than the OS owner), and Apple and Google are also pondering how to take this forward.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2015/3/24/the-state-of-messaging\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Messaging and mobile platforms</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2015/4/3/podcast-messaging-and-mobile-platforms\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Podcast: messaging and mobile platforms\u00c2\u00a0</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2015/1/11/whatsapp-sails-past-sms-but-where-does-messaging-go-next\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">WhatsApp sails past SMS, but where does messaging go next?</a></p>\n<p>See also\u00c2\u00a0<a href=\"https://a16z.com/2015/08/06/wechat-china-mobile-first/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">this primer on WeChat</a>\u00c2\u00a0from my colleague Connie Chan</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h5>11: The unclear future of Android and the OEM world</h5>\n<p>Android won the handset market outside of Apple, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not quite clear what that means. Attempts to make a straight \u00e2\u0080\u0098fork\u00e2\u0080\u0099 of Android (e.g. Kindle Fire) fail on lack of access to Google\u00e2\u0080\u0099s services, but that doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t mean no one can create a mostly non-Google experience \u2013 this is what Xiaomi and its imitators are doing and what Cyanogen is enabling as well.\u00c2\u00a0 And this matters, because the OS, more and more, is a route to discovery of services \u2013 if you control the OS you can shape what people do, far more than you could on the desktop web.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2014/6/21/amazon-and-forks\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon and Android forks</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2015/1/18/why-do-we-care-about-xiaomi\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Why do we care about Xiaomi?</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2015/9/26/mobile-is-not-a-neutral-platform\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Mobile is not a neutral platform</a></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h5>12: Internet of Things</h5>\n<p>Our grandparents could have told you how many electric motors they owned \u2013 there was one in the car, one in the fridge and so on, and they owned maybe a dozen. In the same way, we know roughly how many devices we own with a network connection, and, again, our children won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t. Many of those use cases will seem silly to us, just as our grandparents would laugh at the idea of a button to lower a car window, but the sheer range and cheapness of sensors and components, mostly coming out of the smartphone supply chain, will make them ubiquitous and invisible \u2013 we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll forget about them just as we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve forgotten about electric motors.</p>\n<p>This means, I think, that talk of standards for IoT misses the point \u2013 \u00e2\u0080\u0098connected to a network\u00e2\u0080\u0099 is not any more a category\u00e2\u0080\u0099 than \u00e2\u0080\u0098contains a motor\u00e2\u0080\u0099, and there will be many different platforms and standards. More important is that, especially in the enterprise, this explosion in sensors means an explosion in data \u2013 we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll know far more about far more, and that allows fundamental system redesign.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2014/5/26/the-internet-of-things\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">The internet of things</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2015/1/11/home-and-the-mobile-supply-chain\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">The home and the mobile supply chain</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2014/10/14/the-industrial-internet\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">The industrial internet</a></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h5>13: Cars</h5>\n<p>The move to electric and the move (if and when) to autonomous, self-driving cars fundamentally change what a car is, but also what the whole automotive system might look like.

Autonomy and on-demand services change who buys them, meaning the buying criteria will be different. But they could also change the urban landscape just as much as cars themselves did \u2013 what do mass-market retail or restaurants look like if no-one needs to park?</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2015/7/27/ways-to-think-about-cars\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Ways to think about cars</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2015/8/25/podcast-ways-to-think-about-cars\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Podcast: ways to think about cars</a></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h5>14: TV and the living room</h5>\n<p>The tech industry spent a quarter-century trying to get to the TV set to take it online \u2013 that was going to be the mass-market computer. Now it looks like this might finally be happening, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s almost a side-show \u2013 Microsoft declares Xbox is no longer a strategic asset, TVs are accessories to the smartphone, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the smartphone, not the TV or PC, that delivered the computing revolution and took computing into the living room.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2015/11/24/tv-mobile-and-the-living-room\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">TV, mobile and the living room</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2014/3/27/notes-on-tv\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Notes on TV</a></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h5>15: Watches</h5>\n<p>Watches are maybe the most puzzling satellite in the smartphone solar system.

I\u2019m Lauren Murrow. In normal times, every company operates against some hypothetical growth model\u00e2\u0080\u0094a data-driven framework that describes how your product grows and how you acquire new users. These, of course, are not normal times. In the fallout from the pandemic, most founders and CEOs are in the process of completely revamping their growth models from the bottom up amid new and unpredictable consumer behavior.\u00c2\u00a0</em></p>\n<div>\n<p><em>This episode explores how to think about growth in turbulent times, according two growth experts: a16z general partner Andrew Chen,\u00c2\u00a0who previously led the growth team at Uber, and Brian Balfour, formerly the VP of Growth at HubSpot, now the founder and CEO of Reforge, a masterclass in growth strategies.\u00c2\u00a0</em></p>\n<div><em>The discussion spans four sections: first, how to reassess your existing growth model, particularly when, as Brian says, the data is \u201ccompletely\u00c2\u00a0messed\u201d; next, we drill down into strategy and tactics for surviving the current crisis and talk about how founders can pursue growth even in the midst of widespread uncertainty and cutbacks. Third, we\u2019ll look ahead to discuss scenario planning and how leaders can forge a path forward. Finally, we\u2019ll zoom out and assess the big picture: how various categories of company may be impacted long-term, how this crisis compares to 2008 (and what that means for early-stage founders), and the industries and business models that are now prime for growth.\u00c2\u00a0</em></div>\n<div></div>\n<div><em>We begin by describing a typical a growth model and discuss how that fundamentally drives a company\u2019s business strategy.\u00c2\u00a0</em></div>\n</div>\n<div></div>\n<div><span style=\"font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif\"><strong>Brian</strong>: When we think about a growth model, the question is: how does one cohort of users lead to another cohort of users? And how are you answering that question in a way that describes not only how you acquire users, but the actions that they take in your product, what those actions generate, and how you reinvest whatever that output is back into generating new and returning users.</span></div>\n<div>\n<p>So within this model, you have hypotheses around the who, the what, and the why. Who are doing these actions, what are the actions they are doing, and why they are doing them? These are all fundamental hypotheses, whether you have them written down or not.</p>\n<p><strong>Andrew</strong>: I think a very, very simple, simple shortcut version of this might be something like: I find Yelp because I search for best dumplings in San Francisco, and then a Yelp page comes up. I\u2019m excited about Yelp. At some point, some percentage of those users end up actually then leaving reviews. And then those reviews get indexed by Google, and then they end up in Google\u2019s listings, and then more people find it. So that\u2019s how one group of users might indirectly then lead to another group of users. Versus something like LinkedIn, which is focused on getting people to invite their colleagues and people that they\u2019re meeting through professional networking. It\u2019s very focused around getting you to send invites, and that\u2019s a very different type of a loop.</p>\n<p>It turns out that there are many, many, many flavors of this. This is the verbal version of it. When you go deeper, you\u2019re able to translate this set of hypotheses and ideas into spreadsheets and numerical models for what\u2019s actually happening in the business and understand the flows.</p>\n<p><strong>Brian</strong>: Right. You\u2019re operating against this hypothesis, right? That hypothesis gets stronger over time as you run experiments, you validate them, you see the data and that data feeds the quantitative version of this. In this environment, a lot of those hypotheses are thrown out the window and what we validated in the past might have changed. As a result, you might have tailwinds or headwinds. The quantitative variables behind these things either gets stronger or they get worse. But the only way that you actually get a decent picture of that is by going through each one of these individual steps and asking those questions.</p>\n<p><strong>Lauren</strong>: Once you do drill down into a spreadsheet, what kind of data are you tracking? What are those metrics?</p>\n<p><strong>Andrew</strong>: If you are a travel company right now, I think you\u2019re seeing very specific metrics dropping. If you start at the end of the funnel, what you\u2019re seeing is: number one, there\u2019s going to be fewer people actually booking and converting. If you\u2019re Expedia or Booking, regardless of whether or not people are looking at flights, my guess is the percentage of people who look up a flight versus actually book the flight, that conversion rate is probably down. You probably have folks that end up doing more research because they\u2019re not quite sure when to fly or they feel like, \u201cI have to check the state department website to see where I can actually go.\u201d And then all the way to the demands question, of how many people are in that activity. Versus, I would guess that if you\u2019re inside of one of these collaboration tools, every user is going to be sending more invites to other users because we\u2019re all living in Zoom right now. As a result of that, all of those metrics go up.</p>\n<p>What ends up happening is if you think about the verbal version of the growth model as a series of events that chain together, then what you start to realize is, wow, like there are going to be certain steps that are going to go way, way, way up, that are then going to cause the entire growth model to really radically amplify. Or there\u2019s going to be ones that dramatically tamp things down. And if step one or two of the growth model start hitting a lot of friction, then of course it\u2019s just going to get harder and harder, because each group of users is going to produce fewer and fewer users from an acquisition standpoint. Same thing for engagement, as well.</p>\n<p><strong>Brian</strong>: There\u2019s a couple things about this, though. One is that I\u2019ve seen a ton of categorical data out there. People saying, \u201cThis is what\u2019s happening to B2B SaaS or this is what\u2019s happening to this category.\u201d And I think, specifically for founders who are probably listening to this, the category data is interesting but it\u2019s actually not that helpful.</p>\n<p>Everybody sits on a spectrum of people who are experiencing extreme headwinds\u00e2\u0080\u0094ClassPass, for example, who\u2019s probably seen 90 percent of their business disappear overnight\u00e2\u0080\u0094and people who are seeing extreme tailwinds. If you\u2019re sitting on one of those spectrums, your job is easier. The data\u2019s clear. It\u2019s immediate of what is happening and what the net result is. But the founders who are in the middle of the spectrum have the hard job. You actually have to look at each one of these individual steps to understand what might be changing and what might be happening to build specific hypotheses of how your company should act in response.</p>\n<p><strong>Lauren</strong>: Most companies will need to go to basics and reassess their businesses from the bottom up. So if you are a travel company or an in-person fitness company, how do you go about completely revamping and reevaluating your growth model? How can founders be proactive rather than reactive?</p>\n<p><strong>Brian</strong>: I know it\u2019s like an old Silicon Valley message, talk to your customers, but honestly this is one of those times where you need to be talking to at least a couple customers a couple times a day. Founders, CEOs, executives, the leaders of the team, because the only way that you\u2019re really going to be proactive is going to get a sense for what is going on in your customers\u2019 lives and how things are changing and what questions they\u2019re asking, and how their behaviors are changing. And by the time that comes through the data, it\u2019s going to probably be too late. So if you want to be proactive, you have to go back and rely on a little bit of founder intuition\u2026and the way that you build that founder intuition is by having lots and lots of conversations, very close to it.</p>\n<p><strong>Andrew</strong>: I think a really big thing strategically that\u2019s changing right now is there\u2019s a whole discussion around what should the output goal even be, at the moment. I think this is where the growth model overlays with some of the financials for the company, as well. We\u2019ve had several years where it\u2019s all been about top-line growth and you have a lot of companies that are looking for 2X, 3X, 5X, year-over-year growth. And then the growth model ends up needing to support that.</p>\n<p>But I think the whole industry is saying, \u201cOkay, maybe top-line growth of that type of several hundred percentage points annually is actually not the focus, because everything\u2019s so uncertain.\u201d We have to watch our cash. So what I\u2019ve seen in the conversations I\u2019ve been in, then, is your growth models are actually as much about how do you grow efficiently from a cash standpoint.</p>\n<p>And so, if your whole thing is about: okay, we need 5X growth and that means that people need to invite each other at a certain rate\u00e2\u0080\u0094and if they\u2019re not, then maybe you need to make that up with paid marketing spend; with financial incentives for your users to use the product, whether that\u2019s in the form of free subscriptions or in the form of a lower price point; or, if you\u2019re a marketplace company, you might give people discounts that are dropped into all the consumers\u2019 accounts.</p>\n<p>A lot of what Brian and I have been talking about is oriented around product-driven growth, where you\u2019re getting users for free because they\u2019re engaging what you\u2019re doing. You\u2019re potentially evolving your product over time such that you\u2019re able to tap into higher engagement.</p>\n<p><strong>Lauren</strong>: That\u2019s an interesting point, that this may lead to a broader shift toward product-driven growth, as opposed to some of the previous strategies that we relied upon.</p>\n<p><strong>Brian</strong>: That shift has been happening for a while, and I think this just probably accelerates it. And so, we\u2019ve seen a product-led growth motion certainly in the B2B space happening slowly. And a lot of companies that don\u2019t have that motion are now like, \u201cHey, should we develop a free use case for this product?\u201d We know that that mental shift is happening. I also think it probably accelerates a ton of mistakes in this area.</p>\n<p><strong>Lauren</strong>: How so?</p>\n<p>Brian: Because companies that didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t previously have a free use-case of their product typically think that they can get to a free use-case just by taking their existing product and removing a couple things and turning it free. That\u2019s not how it happens. You build very intentionally for a product-led motion: how you build that first user experience in activation, how it spreads within the organizations, and how you detect the signals that they\u2019re ready to upgrade. All of those things don\u2019t happen overnight or by just removing a couple features of your product and reducing the price.</p>\n<p><strong>Andrew</strong>: I think those are maybe two distinct things. One is readjusting the output metrics\u00e2\u0080\u0094the extrications that you have for how you\u2019re going to grow\u00e2\u0080\u0094and second is how do you evolve your growth model to tap into the kind of engagement that\u2019s working right now.</p>\n<p>I\u2019ll give a quick example: Lunchclub. The previous model was that each week they would set you up in a professional networking context with someone else in the industry, and they would get your profile and what your goals are and match you with somebody really interesting. They give you a time slot, then you meet for coffee. Well, all of a sudden, you can\u2019t do that anymore. But what you <em>can</em> do is you can shift all of those meetings from in-real-life coffee meetings to virtual, which is exactly what they\u2019ve done. You\u2019ve now completely pivoted your growth model from something that encourages real-life interaction to something that\u2019s virtual, which you can do many more of, and in many ways you\u2019re going to be less flaky and you\u2019re going to have better experiences, which is exactly what they\u2019ve seen. And by tapping into that, you actually can get much better growth.</p>\n<p><strong>Lauren</strong>: But I think one of the challenges is that consumer behaviors are so unpredictable right now. You can have a hypothesis about how changing that model is going to impact the bottom line, But for many businesses, perhaps you\u2019re flying blind until you see if it works or if it doesn\u2019t.</p>\n<p><strong>Brian</strong>: To the point about unpredictably, if you\u2019re facing headwinds or you\u2019re facing some kind of friction around people converting or people paying, this is the time to basically fill the lakes and dam up the lakes.</p>\n<p>Christopher O\u2019Donnell, who\u2019s now the chief product officer at HubSpot, developed this analogy. As we talked about our growth model, he described parts of the user journey that are lakes, and parts of the journey that are rivers. He\u2019s talking about loops and funnels. What he means is there are parts of the user journey where the user gets in there, they\u2019re engaged, they\u2019re kind of hanging out for a while. And at some point, there\u2019s a part in that journey where they\u2019re showing some level of intent that they\u2019re ready to move to the next stage. So you put them through a conversion funnel, let\u2019s say, like a signup, and then they get into another lake.</p>\n<p>If people just aren\u2019t in the mindset to convert and you\u2019re seeing headwinds, then the best thing you can do is build up this stored potential that you might be able to convert later, and that\u2019s really where to start to invest.</p>\n<p>An example of this that you see a lot of companies doing is like Loom. Loom is this asynchronous video messaging product. So rather than writing a long email, I can quickly record a video and send it to somebody. A method that they went down is that they completely opened up limitations on their free plan and reduced their paid plan by 50 percent. So what are they doing here, in the context of their growth model? Well, a core part of their growth model is this loop where somebody records a video, they share that video with somebody. Somebody sees that video, signs up for Loom, and then they start recording videos on Loom, as well. So what they\u2019ve done is they\u2019ve basically removed all the friction possible from that loop by opening up their free plan and just allowing that loop to spin as much as possible, filling up the lake. And at some point, this pool of people will have more intent to convert or more ability to pay for the product. And so, what they\u2019re really doing is they\u2019re building up stored monetization potential.</p>\n<p>There are a number of companies that have taken moves to do this.\u00c2\u00a0 Even Peloton did this by offering, I think 90 days free on their product. You see companies both with headwinds and tailwinds doing that, and that\u2019s because this has been an injection of weird customer behavior. And so the question is: how do you respond to that customer behavior? You can either ride the tailwinds or fight the headwinds by filling your lakes and storing that monetization potential for a later date.</p>\n<p><strong>Andrew</strong>: Why Loom and Zoom and Clubhouse and some of the other new social experiences benefit is that you can use the current boom in engagement and viral growth to build out your network. Then what ends up happening is you get this density, you get all these network effects, you get increased engagement, etc. And that creates this really interesting zero-to-one period of being able to launch into potentially a much bigger network. Even when everything goes back to normal, you can perpetuate this network that you\u2019ve already built up during this time.</p>\n<p><strong>Brian</strong>: There\u2019s a question here for the super-early-stage startups, those that are experiencing tailwinds: is the tailwind the end, or is it a means to an end? What I mean by that is, let\u2019s say I\u2019m an ed-tech startup that\u2019s focused on some kind of product for home schooling. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m probably seeing a really big surge right now because parents are just like, \u201cWhat the hell do I do with the kids?!\u201d\u00c2\u00a0 They\u2019re probably seeing a massive surge. That\u2019s probably going to give them a huge injection of fuel right away, but what\u2019s permanent, what\u2019s not permanent?</p>\n<p>And so, for companies in situations like that, I\u2019d be thinking about, okay, how do I use this time as like a means to an end? Meaning, if I don\u2019t believe that this behavior change is permanent, how do I like use this as a jumping off point? At some point I\u2019m going to have to transition them to some use-case or change their mindset of how they view this product to something that\u2019s more permanent and more long-term. How do I use this as acceleration fuel? That transition is going to be really key. And those that view this as an end, they\u2019re going to experience massive churn at some point. And so, planning against that and using this as a launching platform, I think, is a big question for startups.</p>\n<p><strong>Lauren</strong>: I\u2019d like to shift and talk about growth in a downturn\u00e2\u0080\u0094it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s kind of the elephant in the room. The very concept of growth can seem aspirational to some at the moment. Many are having cutbacks and cash flow issues. How do you balance necessary cutbacks with growth?</p>\n<p><strong>Andrew</strong>: I think the very simplest things to do tend to be: okay, we had a growth model where paid marketing was part of the input. And it turns out that we need to go reevaluate all of it because it no longer converts. Whatever CAC LTV assumptions that we had potentially no longer hold. In a lot of cases, when the companies are facing headwinds, things like that are the first things that get cut.</p>\n<p>And that easy evolution is taking some of the channels that potentially no longer work or some components of the growth model that no longer work, and cutting them and saying, \u201cLook, if it turns out that this period is longer than six months, it\u2019s better to get rid of this, and then we can rebuild the function later,\u201d whether that\u2019s from an expertise or infrastructure perspective. And that\u2019s a little bit more evolutionary.</p>\n<p><strong>Brian</strong>: I want to empathize with the other founders out there, which is I don\u2019t think you ever truly know 100 percent right now if you\u2019re cutting enough versus too much.</p>\n<p>And so this is the really hard thing, where you\u2019re essentially taking bets on certain things. When you frame it as: \u00e2\u0080\u009chere\u2019s what we\u2019re taking a bet on,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I think the conversation changes, because you can start to talk about confidence of these bets and different actions. But the things that you should probably be cutting if you\u2019re trying to be really conservative are a lot of the super-specialized functions. And retaining the people that help you adapt and move quickly, the more versatile people, internally. But if you\u2019re starting to cut into the people that allow you to adapt and move, you\u2019re probably only doing that if you\u2019re in a super cash-constrained position and you 100 percent have to.</p>\n<p><strong>Lauren</strong>: How should companies think about growth if they\u2019re cash-constrained?</p>\n<p><strong>Andrew</strong>: You end up needing to decide what is considered a specialization. What\u2019s considered optional versus what\u2019s the core of the business? And I think that could be a refocusing strategy discussion for the whole company. I have now had multiple conversations with founders where they do a cut and the team needs to make tougher decisions, more focused decisions, and actually everyone feels really good as a result. Your leaders in the company, your high-performers, they\u2019re going to know if your growth model\u2019s not working, all your dashboards are going haywire, and you\u2019re not making the hard decisions. That\u2019s a red flag for a lot of people on the team. Being early to recognize that and confronting that and making the right decisions, I think, will garner respect from everyone around you, even though it\u2019s obviously an enormously, enormously tough decision that we would rather not make.</p>\n<p><strong>Brian</strong>: Part of that, too, is writing down the things you\u2019re taking bets on, so that in 30 days you can continually go back to that and be like, \u201cOkay, we made these choices because\u00e2\u0080\u00a6do we have any data that points in the direction? Are we right or wrong about these things?\u201d</p>\n<p>At least at Reforge, a lot of our revenue comes from company education budgets. And so we went on a big research project to try to understand what was happening with those budgets across different segments of our customers. We opened up all of that data to our team. We said, \u201cHere\u2019s what we think and how we interpret the data. Here\u2019s what we\u2019re going to take the bets on and here\u2019s the resulting things, and we\u2019re going to check back in on this in 30 days.\u201d And so, we enumerated that very clearly to the team.</p>\n<p>I think you need to make it super-clear to the company the operational changes that you\u2019re making. You typically have to have the more directive leadership style, versus curating things from the bottom up, in order to move quickly. But if you change that style and you need to actually tell the team, \u201cHey, we are changing to this style because\u2026\u201d so that they understand that, \u201cHey, this probably isn\u2019t a permanent way of operating, but it\u2019s necessary and at some point we\u2019ll get back to some of these other methods.\u201d</p>\n<p><strong>Lauren</strong>: So in good times, many startups take this iterative approach: they run various experiments as they pursue product market fit. I\u2019ve heard a bit from both of you on one hand, saying you really have to cut that out right now and buckle down to your core strategy\u00e2\u0080\u0094or that you need to shift and continue to run these experiments and be reactive and maybe a little quicker to change than you might under ordinary circumstances. How do you think about experiments at a time like this, when we\u2019re in a lot of economic uncertainty?</p>\n<p><strong>Brian</strong>: It depends on what type of experiment we\u2019re talking about. If we\u2019re talking about an experiment in the context of, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u2019m actually running some type of A/B multi-variate task to try to get statistical significance\u00e2\u0080\u009d and stuff like that, I would be throwing them out the window because the data\u2019s completely messed at this point. And whatever results you\u2019re getting isn\u2019t going to be a core learning that\u2019s predictive of the future. So any of those types of experiments, you have to be thinking about running them in parts of the product where you have really high volume that you\u2019re going to get results very quickly, versus those that are going to take weeks to get data and start to influence a core product change that might last for months or years. Those are probably bad experiments to be running right now, because you\u2019re going to be acting on either bad data or bad learnings or on a time window that doesn\u2019t really matter.</p>\n<p>But if we\u2019re talking about experiments in the sense of: \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u2019m trying things and I\u2019m trying to gauge the reaction, either qualitatively or anecdotally,\u00e2\u0080\u009d those are a different set of experiments. What you\u2019re really looking for is an obvious reaction that something is working or not working, versus statistically significant data. I think the question there is, how much of your team\u2019s time should be spent on things that are reactive to the current environment, versus trying to invest resources that feed the business in the long term.</p>\n<p><strong>Andrew</strong>: A/B tasks and experiments, it\u2019s a context-dependent tool. And A/B tasks are often the most useful for refining something. They\u2019re often very, very good for optimization problems. And so, if you already know exactly the thing that you want, a specific output\u00e2\u0080\u0094you want an invite screen to produce a certain thing, you want a payment screen to have a certain conversion rate\u00e2\u0080\u0094A/B tests are amazing at that. What A/B tests are not very good at are, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwell, our product no longer works anymore and we\u2019ve lost product market fit, and who knows if it\u2019ll ever return.\u00e2\u0080\u009d And at that point, I think then you\u2019re basically back to a zero-to-one product market fit search. You\u2019re almost coming up with a new product. And hopefully you can reuse a bunch of what you\u2019ve previously built, but I think in many cases there\u2019s a bunch of companies out there in some of the headwind categories that need to be thinking about pivoting their core product idea.</p>\n<p><strong>Lauren</strong>: What is your advice to founders? Do you plan to endure or do you plan to adapt?</p>\n<p><strong>Brian</strong>: I think for most founders, they\u2019re probably first erring on the conservative side of things, shifting back to the endure end of the spectrum, and will then shift into an adapt plan at a quicker rate. That\u2019s what I see most founders doing.</p>\n<p>But I also see founders who are in an amazing cash position, even though they\u2019re not experiencing massive tailwinds, doing very aggressive things. Guillaume Cabane, who\u2019s the former VP of Growth at Segment and Drift, came up with this with a lot of his companies: for those in the cash position, they\u2019ve actually been creating a list of all the companies using their competitors, going to them and offering them to switch to their product for free for a year. It\u2019s a very aggressive move that some people might have the option to take, even though they\u2019re not experiencing very obvious tailwinds in this environment. The question is, if you\u2019re in that middle part of the spectrum, what choice do you want to take a bet on?</p>\n<p><strong>Andrew</strong>: I think ultimately, the act of entrepreneurship is really rooted in optimism. Ultimately, the entrepreneurs out there are going to try completely new things, they are basically going to start new companies, using the resources and the employees that they have, and I\u2019m sure we\u2019re going to see a ton of success cases there. We\u2019re also going to see a bunch of folks that singularly held to a vision and cut the costs that they needed to, and they\u2019ll see the other side of that. And I think ultimately, both strategies can work.</p>\n<p><strong>Lauren</strong>: I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d like to look ahead to the future, for those founders who are attempting to scenario plan. Where should a founder begin when they\u2019re trying to map out a path forward?</p>\n<p><strong>Andrew</strong>: As a founder in these really, really uncertain times, you end up needing to be able to keep two complete extremes in your head at the same time. In one extreme, you basically have to say, \u201cThe whole ecosystem\u2019s going to fall apart. We\u2019re not going to book any revenue for the next 12 months. And then when things come back, it\u2019s only going to come back at 50 percent, and then after year three, maybe it\u2019ll come back a little bit more.\u201d You need to be really, really conservative about that, like, \u201cOkay, we have to plan around the wheels completely coming off and just complete disaster scenario.\u201d And you have to have that in your brain, which is terrifying because it\u2019s many, many, many multiples of anything that you would ever typically plan\u2026and that\u2019s why we have companies that are basically going into hibernation and thinking about waiting all of this out. That\u2019s one end of the spectrum.</p>\n<p>In the same way, you also have to have enough resourcing and optimism and leadership and vision to think, \u201cNo, we\u2019re going to get out of this, and this is why this is going to be a huge business in 2021 or 2022\u201d on the other side of this. I think you need to keep both those extremes in mind, because if you only have one, if you only go the conservative route, then what you\u2019re telling the team and what you\u2019re telling your investors is, \u201cWe\u2019re not going to do anything for the rest of the year,\u201d and you don\u2019t want that. That\u2019s not an exciting vision for your top people to work in. Then they\u2019ll go somewhere like B2B collaboration tools or they\u2019ll go into games where things are growing really fast, or groceries.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, if you\u2019re overly optimistic, you\u2019re creating existential risk where if things don\u2019t come back on the timeframe that you\u2019re predicting then, all of a sudden, you\u2019re gambling the entire fate of your company on that, as well. In a lot of the startup conversations I\u2019ve been having, if you lean too far that way, it doesn\u2019t resonate with people. Because if something feels like it\u2019s overly promising, no one\u2019s going to believe it. It\u2019s not a great look, from the leadership standpoint. Keeping both of those in your head is very, very hard, but I think you have to be able to do it.</p>\n<p><strong>Brian</strong>: Our monkey brains are not designed to balance those things at the same time. We are not built for that.</p>\n<p>At least what we\u2019ve done at Reforge is we\u2019ve looked at our scenarios on a wider range of outcomes than we would typically consider. Everything from a 20 percent cut in demand down to an 80 percent cut in demand over a wider range of time periods. And it\u2019s less likely that those extremes happen, but they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re more likely than in typical situations. So that\u2019s why you have to account for those. And then, as a company you need to decide where on that spectrum of wide outcomes that you really want to sit. And this really depends on where your cash position is, what the status of your investors is that, and how easy it is to go out and generate more cash if one of the extremes happens.</p>\n<p><strong>Andrew</strong>: I think we would all love to believe that this is this temporary thing. The context there is that it is very likely that there\u2019ll be a cascade such that we\u2019re actually at the very, very, very beginning of a 20- to 30-month market downturn. That feels very plausible to me, that that\u2019s what\u2019s going to happen.</p>\n<p>And so, if you start thinking about things in that timeframe, 20 to 30 months, that means that every startup has to think not only about the potential impact on their next fundraise. It used to be that our entire startup ecosystem was all about: you raise money for the next 18 months, because you know that there\u2019s another round down the path. So now, all of a sudden, if you\u2019re thinking 20 to 30 months, then well, the next round might be really hard to do. But also, the next <em>next</em> round might be really hard to do. And so then the discussion becomes: as an ecosystem, what becomes attractive in this kind of environment?</p>\n<p><strong>Lauren</strong>: Various categories of company are obviously feeling the impact in different ways and on different timelines. How do your planning scenarios differ for different types of businesses?</p>\n<p>Andrew: One of the educational and illuminating things that we\u2019ve seen over the last couple weeks is there are very clear industries and product categories that are benefiting from everybody sheltering in place, and then there are clear ones that are not.</p>\n<p>If you\u2019re in entertainment, you\u2019re in games, you\u2019re doing something in video, you\u2019re doing something in workplace collaboration, all of those have obviously benefited. You\u2019re seeing across-the-board higher conversion rates, more time in the apps, and as a result, more acquisition. It\u2019s half the price right now to acquire a user for one of these entertainment products.</p>\n<p>Pretty much any product that\u2019s subscription and has really high retention on the subscription side is going to be an interesting state, because you can maybe acquire a lot of these customers for cheaper through paid marketing, through more engagement. And if you\u2019re able to then retain a really high degree of renewal after this, then those users will probably keep forever. I\u2019m not surprised that Netflix and Spotify, but also YouTube subscription products and even Fortnight Battle Passes stand to benefit because they can continue to retain these folks over the course of multiple years.</p>\n<p>The question then becomes, how do they persist the advantage that they\u2019re getting into the future, and what types of companies are actually able to get that? And I think I would point to a couple things. Number one, growth models that are just extremely efficient and don\u2019t require a lot of dollars in order to create growth. A really good example that we\u2019ve seen is that there are a ton of companies that are building on Zoom as a platform now. There\u2019s a bunch of Zoom dating apps. Run the World, is a conference product that also has integrated video. And so, you look at a lot of products like that and you say, \u201cOkay, wow, these could grow really efficiently. They could take advantage of the current time.\u00e2\u0080\u009d</p>\n<p><strong>Lauren</strong>: How do you think that these broader societal shifts are impacting growth? Shelter in place, work from home, is that going to have a long-term impact on how companies are going to need to think about growth?</p>\n<p><strong>Andrew</strong>: I think it is a really, really big assumption even 12 months from now that things are going to go back to normal. Maybe a bunch of consumer behaviors are actually going to fundamentally change as a result of this. Maybe, for example, now that everyone\u2019s used to working from home, all of a sudden a bunch of products that were oriented around that will gain, and a bunch of products that were oriented around in-real-life workplace settings will be less attractive. And that impact may span multiple years. If you start thinking about it that way then you may have to fundamentally evolve the value proposition of your product in a different direction. In the Lunchclub case, that\u2019s one example where I don\u2019t know that that company is going to want to go back to in-real-life meetings after this, because it just turns out that maybe virtual is better, right?</p>\n<p>Similarly, Virtual Kitchen Company operates a network of dark kitchens. What they do is sign up local restaurant brands. And once these restaurant brands start doing delivery and they see the value proposition is really, really strong, then do they go back to saying, \u201cActually, no delivery, we just want to do our brick and mortar thing.\u201d Maybe not. I think that there are huge opportunities. Potentially, we\u2019re pulling forward a lot of the behaviors that were going to happen anyway, but we\u2019re just pulling them ahead five years or something. And then I think there\u2019s going to be things where it\u2019ll happen this way, but it\u2019ll be in the negative, as well.</p>\n<p><strong>Brian</strong>: I go back and forth on this. I go back and forth on how permanent some of these behavior changes are and how strong our basic human motivations and needs are and how that can just pull us back to the norm. I do think it\u2019s probably accelerated our comfortableness with doing some things online. I think people who have been sitting in offices for 20 years or their entire career were like, \u201cI could never do remote work,\u201d because they\u2019ve never done it, right? But when you\u2019re forced into certain situations and actually do those things, a lot of times you realize, \u201cOh, okay, this isn\u2019t actually as bad as I thought it would be.\u201d</p>\n<p><strong>Andrew</strong>: In terms of the growth function, I think that a lot of what Brian and I have worked on over the years has been this emergence of all of these growth teams inside of the top tech companies. And a lot of the reason, foundationally, this occurred was because a lot of the traditional \u201cbrand marketing tactics\u201d starting back in the \u201990s of buying TV commercials and doing events didn\u2019t seem appropriate for the new generation of consumer companies. Instead, it ended up being these interdisciplinary teams inside of companies that tried to solve tricky problems around: how do you get your product to grow itself?</p>\n<p>I do think that what we will for sure see in these types of market downturns is there almost always a bit advertising pullback. We certainly see that if you\u2019re part of the travel industry, those folks are cutting their marketing budgets in a big way. And if you look at the earnings stats from the Googles and other folks they\u2019re saying, \u201cHey, the next couple quarters may be rough as far as advertising goes.\u201d If you have that and you\u2019re basically like, \u201cOkay, you can no longer grow through advertising,\u00e2\u0080\u009d what do you do next? I do think that there will be a retrenchment into the idea of: you have to build the best product, you have to take advantage of the consumer behaviors that are emerging.</p>\n<p><strong>Lauren</strong>: What do you see as the differences between \u201908, \u201909 and now? And do you think those differences are beneficial to founders?</p>\n<p><strong>Brian</strong>: I think the most important point is globally, the number of people coming onto the internet isn\u2019t growing at such a fast rate. Mobile isn\u2019t growing on a fast rate. We don\u2019t have as open platforms as we used to have. All of these major tailwinds that definitely projected or fueled out of the \u201908, \u201909 aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t there. I do think that is a massive difference.</p>\n<p><strong>Andrew</strong>: I think there are two things that are different from the last era. One is, recall the iPhone platform, the Facebook platform. Those things all got created in 2007, 2008. It\u2019s very much aligned with some really big technologically-driven shifts. I think you could argue that now, audio is very, very interesting for all the Alexa devices, all the air pods. Video is very, very interesting, games is very interesting\u2026we\u2019ll see what happens with Google Stadium and xCloud, but also Steam, and so on. There\u2019s a lot that\u2019s happening around building really compelling consumer-y experiences in the enterprise, that\u2019s very interesting. I do think there\u2019s a couple of these, but it\u2019s not as obvious as the Apple iPhone.</p>\n<p>The second thing that I think is really different for 2008, 2009, compared to now is that taking a job at one of the big tech companies is now way, way, way more compelling now than before. Just how competitive the comp packages are, the fact that a bunch of these companies are actually working on interesting things. In comparison, if you were in 2008, it was like, \u201cOh yeah, do I work for Google or not Google?\u201d But now you\u2019re in a world where you\u2019re like, \u201cOh, maybe I should work for Pinterest and Airbnb and Slack.\u201d These companies are all working on really, really cool things. I think that will cause new entrepreneurs to maybe second guess on where they want to be.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, there\u2019s no time in history that it\u2019s been easier to get your first million bucks in funding. I love that idea that as an ecosystem, we\u2019ve decided that, \u201cLook, if you\u2019re legit, you want to start a company, there\u2019s a community of people willing to take a bet on that.\u201d And so I think some things have gotten easier, some things have gotten harder. But I still remain optimistic that over the next few years that some of the best companies that we\u2019ll see in this generation will be created.</p>\n<p><strong>Brian</strong>: As a founder, I appreciate the optimistic view. Once again, flipping back and forth between the two sides of the monkey brain.</p>\n<p><strong>Andrew</strong>: I remember when I was coming out of college people were talking about, \u201cIs it going to be possible to ever make money on the internet?\u201d It was a real question that smart people were asking, right? And we saw the same pattern repeated in 2008, 2009: the companies came in the years right after that ended up being really compelling companies, and I think the same thing will happen here if you can make it to the other side.</p>\n<p><strong>Lauren</strong>: Yeah, it\u2019s being able to lean into that agility\u00e2\u0080\u0094to shift strategies quickly and adapt.</p>\n<p><strong>Andrew</strong>: Right. Some of the key things that we talked about today, like collaboration tools and entertainment and social products, all of a sudden, all of those sound really, really good. We spent most of this conversation talking about existing entrepreneurs, like you already have something and you\u2019re trying to figure out what to do with it. I think there\u2019s a whole other very, very interesting question that is: over the next year, you\u2019re going to have a bunch of entrepreneurs that are going to start companies from scratch, and what are they going to pick? And the things I think they\u2019re going to pick are going to be very, very different as well.</p>\n<p>I\u2019m certainly very excited and very bullish about how all the tools that we\u2019re going to have for working from home or entertaining ourselves or feeling that social connection even if we\u2019re not there in person, how that\u2019s going to get supercharged. I think over the next two years, we\u2019re going to have the entire generation of entrepreneurs tackling these problems.</p>\n<p><strong>Lauren</strong>: Thank you for joining us on the a16z Podcast.</p>\n<p><strong>Brian</strong>: Thanks for having me.</p>\n<p><strong>Andrew</strong>: This was great.

The intersection of learning and technology has been accelerated by the pandemic, but the debate around education\u2019s \u201cdisruption,\u201d and what that means for educators doing the hands-on work of teaching, has been swirling for years.</p>\n<p>In this episode, a16z general partner <a href=\"https://a16z.com/author/connie-chan/\">Connie Chan</a> and host <a href=\"https://a16z.com/author/lauren-murrow/\">Lauren Murrow</a> are joined by educators and experts <a href=\"http://joshmkim.com/\">Josh Kim</a>, the Director of Online Programs and Strategy at Dartmouth College (whose most recent book, <em><a href=\"https://jhupbooks.press.jhu.edu/title/low-density-university\">The Low-Density University: 15 Scenarios for Higher Education</a></em>, is out today), and <a href=\"https://scholar.harvard.edu/ddeming/home\">David Deming</a>, Professor of Education and Economics at the Harvard Kennedy School and the Harvard Graduate School of Education.

What improvements have we seen over the past decade, and what improvements are we likely to see this fall, compared to the COVID scramble last spring?

Much of the discussion seems to be, \u201cOnline education was this abject failure in the spring, now kids are doomed to lose another year if we don\u2019t go back in person.\u201d So what I\u2019d like to pose to the group is: What are some of the most common misconceptions you see in the discourse around online education?</p>\n<p><strong>Josh Kim</strong>: Well, first of all, we didn\u2019t really have online education in the spring. That wasn\u2019t anything that any of us who have been in online education for a long time would recognize as online education. So I think we first have to completely move away from making any conclusions about online education from this emergency pivot to remote learning due to COVID.</p>\n<p><strong>Connie Chan</strong>: Right. And I would argue that we should also make sure that we are not just judging the concept of online education by what we see today. There\u2019s just so much potential for further innovation around the platform, around the medium, that I think we just don\u2019t see, but we already see in other countries around the world.</p>\n<p><strong>David Deming</strong>: I think one common misconception is more of a conflating of two things. One is the medium by which education happens\u00e2\u0080\u0094is it online or in-person or some mix of the two? And then the pedagogical approach\u00e2\u0080\u0094is it lecture based, is it discussion based, how much of it is student facing, what is the size of the class, what is being taught and in what way?</p>\n<p>And I think what you see from most of the pretty brief history of online education is that classes that are online tend to be of one type. It is often quite different than what you see in person. So when people say online education, they often have this idea: maybe it\u2019s a superstar lecturer that\u2019s, you know, broadcast all over the web, or it\u2019s a for-profit college that people perceive as being predatory on some types of students or whatever. But there\u2019s nothing that is intrinsic about online that makes it better or worse.</p>\n<p>At its core, online is a mode of delivery for education that has tremendous potential to reach people that couldn\u2019t be reached with in-person education models.</p>\n<p><strong>Connie</strong>: With far better curriculum than they could have afforded.</p>\n<p><strong>David</strong>: Potentially.</p>\n<p><strong>Connie</strong>: Potentially.</p>\n<p><strong>David</strong>: Although, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a guarantee. I think we should get into that. I think there\u2019s a question of whether the education can be better and under what conditions. It is true that you see a lot of education innovators in the online space, but a lot of what they\u2019re doing could just as easily be done in person.</p>\n<p>What I would like to hear is more discussion of what should education look like, and then we decide whether it\u2019s easiest or best to deliver it online versus in-person, rather than debating about online versus in-person and only later talking about what we\u2019re actually teaching and how we\u2019re teaching.</p>\n<p><strong>Josh</strong>: Yeah, I agree with that. One of the challenges we have when we talk about all of this is definitions. People often talk about online education when they\u2019re talking about a lot of different things and very different things.</p>\n<p><strong>Connie</strong>: Yeah. And I think to that point, some people are thinking of this as strictly K to 12 or K to college. In reality, you can also lump in things like a master class, things like lifelong learning, things like worker training, things like extracurricular classes that have already been online well before COVID.</p>\n<p><strong>Josh</strong>: So, one of the confusions we often hear is to conflate online education at scale, which kind of started with MOOCs and now have moved on to what Coursera does or what edX does, with what\u2019s been going on with online education now for a couple of decades, which looks very different than that, \u00c2\u00a0which is about very small classes, lots of active learning, lots of engagement between students and faculty, a lot of work with instructional designers. They happen to be the same medium. They happen to be education that\u2019s done with technology. But they\u2019re completely different things.</p>\n<p><strong>Lauren</strong>: You mentioned the precedent of MOOCs, which is massive open online courses. Those have been hyped for a decade or so and have had limited success in disrupting education, it\u2019s pretty commonly agreed. So, what has changed? Why do you see this newfound optimism now? What specifically are we seeing that we haven\u2019t seen in the past?</p>\n<p><strong>Connie</strong>: I think if you judge MOOCs, historically, they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been really targeted for college students and post-college graduates. And I think the effectiveness of MOOCs varies dramatically based of the age group and the kind of content you\u2019re trying to teach.</p>\n<p><strong>Lauren</strong>: It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an important point to make, which is that online education is not optimal for every subject or every learner. And so, I think we can get more nitty-gritty when we\u2019re talking about how it translates for younger kids versus older kids\u00e2\u0080\u00a6</p>\n<p><strong>Connie</strong>: Shy kids, right? Kids who are bullied. You hear about them preferring online school. It really just ranges on the type of student and the age range.</p>\n<p>And I can understand why in the college bracket it hasn\u2019t necessarily taken off. There are so many other things that a college provides to the student. And often times, the students want to be on campus. They do get different kinds of credentials with every university.</p>\n<p>But if you take that concept of very large classroom and you target a different age group with different kinds of content, the value proposition could actually be quite different. So, for example, if I was teaching, say, a singing class and I opened it up to 1,000 students. And because I have that many students, the prices were very affordable or could even be free. One could argue that that potentially could work. So a lot of the criticism around MOOCs has been, I think, a function of the age group they\u2019re targeting and the type of content they try to deliver.</p>\n<p><strong>Lauren</strong>: That\u2019s a good point to bring up. Many educators have been skeptical of online learning to date because it\u2019s difficult to run, say, discussion-based courses or lab work. Group work can pose challenges.</p>\n<p>David, you\u2019ve noted that what\u2019s called high-dosage tutoring\u00e2\u0080\u0094that\u2019s small groups meeting frequently\u00e2\u0080\u0094has been shown to be one of the most effective ways to improve learning, in addition to individualized feedback. So, the question is: can ed tech deliver the kind of personalized education that traditional education can?</p>\n<p><strong>David</strong>: I think it definitely can. I think the question is whether it can do so at lower costs and reach people who wouldn\u2019t otherwise be reached. It\u2019s an access question and a cost question. And I would put MOOCs toward one end of a spectrum, where the extreme is just a lecture you post online or a TED Talk or content that\u2019s just online.</p>\n<p>You know, somewhere online you could find the very best lecture on the principles of microeconomics by the very best explainer of those principles. And you can watch it. And that\u2019s something that\u2019s widely available. And the marginal cost of providing that to another person once you produce it is zero. And so you put it online for as many people who can access it as possible. But there\u2019s absolutely no personalization at all. Everyone\u2019s watching the same lecture.</p>\n<p>And that\u2019s good for some people, but most people learn through some element of personalization. You know, meeting people where they are, addressing a specific learning needs motivating them to care and show up to class and turn in assignments and stay on task when things get difficult. That\u2019s the hard work of education. And that doesn\u2019t scale as easily as the MOOC or the online lecture.</p>\n<p>And so, I think the question is whether ed tech can deliver that at lower cost. I think it\u2019s possible. I think it\u2019s much harder than just creating great content and putting it up on the web and charging a very small fee for it. And I think that\u2019s basically why MOOCs haven\u2019t revolutionized the market, because that\u2019s not really what education is. Education is not just content. It\u2019s also engagement and personalization.</p>\n<p><strong>Connie</strong>: It\u2019s the peer group, it\u2019s the feedback. There are start-ups, though, that are trying to tackle that, that are creating small breakout groups for many of these large topics.</p>\n<p><strong>David</strong>: Yeah. I think those are very promising. I just think that, to me, that\u2019s where education and learning really needs to go\u00e2\u0080\u0094some combination of personalization and scale. It\u2019s a very hard problem.</p>\n<p><strong>Connie</strong>: It is a hard problem. And the content has to be really good so that there are higher completion rates than what we have currently. I think a lot of people are realizing that content can be improved, especially with multimedia. Can you use some interactive hand gesture, even, to make sure that kids stay engaged and finish the class?</p>\n<p>The trickiness is going to be how it feels at the end of the day different than a YouTube video. I think a lot of it still comes down to: how do you design it in a way that will have a motivating factor for the student to go seek it out and complete it?</p>\n<p><strong>Lauren</strong>: Are there types of subjects that lend themselves better to an online curriculum versus in-person?</p>\n<p><strong>Josh</strong>: So, I think about this a lot because my daughters are a rising junior and now going to be a rising grad student. Where I see the future is going, which I see benefits and risks, is at the master\u2019s level. And it\u2019s master\u2019s degrees at scale\u00e2\u0080\u0094basically low cost, hopefully high-quality master\u2019s degrees at scale. We see Illinois with its iMBA. We see BU with their low-cost MBA. Georgia Tech with computer science.</p>\n<p>And basically, these are master\u2019s degrees that will not supplant MBAs or computer science degrees from elite institutions and will not supplant the experience you get when you come to campus and can hang out with great faculty like David. There\u2019s no way to replace that intimate learning experience where you\u2019re with that cohort and have that experience. That\u2019s priceless. But most master\u2019s degrees now don\u2019t provide that.</p>\n<p>My younger daughter wants to be an elementary teacher. She\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have to get a master\u2019s in education to get a good job. I\u2019m not convinced that she needs to go to a very expensive master\u2019s program. I think that she can actually be fine with a master\u2019s program that is low-cost, more at-scale, where she gets the content, the peer group, and she gets coached and mentored by maybe not a faculty member. So, I think it would be wonderful if she could become a teacher with a master\u2019s degree without all that debt. I think there\u2019s enormous potential here.</p>\n<p><strong>Connie</strong>: Yeah, Josh, when you talk about the master\u2019s program, it really makes me think a lot of it comes down to credentials too, right? So, can you use technology to allow more people to get those credentials in a cheaper way? And using technology to also have new signals that go beyond just the credential certificate.</p>\n<p>Like, if your daughter took classes online, theoretically, whatever program supplied that service would know her grades, would know her scores, would know her performance. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a lot of opportunities, I think, in helping people get those credentials in a more affordable way.</p>\n<p><strong>Josh</strong>: On the downside, colleges and universities have used master\u2019s degrees to support their money-losing undergraduate programs. Tuition discounting is so high now that they really need these master\u2019s degrees, which have grown much more quickly than undergraduate degrees, to balance the books.</p>\n<p>So what we\u2019re going to see is for middle-tier schools or schools without elite brands, their high-cost master\u2019s degrees are going to become less and less tenable as top-branded schools bring out these degrees, as well as non-degree credentials.</p>\n<p><strong>Connie</strong>: And in addition, there\u2019s other outside forces affecting it. Like losing international students this year or massive state budget cuts that we haven\u2019t seen the consequences of yet.</p>\n<p><strong>Lauren</strong>: So, you\u2019re moving into the economics part of the discussion. And it\u2019s something that has been in the news, in that many college graduates are graduating with debt. It has also popped up in younger age groups, more recently, as many upper-income families are trying to create their own pod schools. It\u2019s this question of the economics of education and whether it may be turned into some kind of a luxury good.</p>\n<p><strong>Josh</strong>: You know, David\u2019s talked about this, what we have to guard against is this bundled experience that my kids got, that it doesn\u2019t just become the province for the wealthiest or the most privileged. And it\u2019s very worrying and disturbing about how we\u2019re moving in this direction in this country.</p>\n<p>But this is where the VC and the ed tech community really can talk about inequality and the concentration of wealth and hold schools like where David and I are where there\u2019s more people from the top 1 percent than the bottom two-thirds.</p>\n<p><strong>Lauren</strong>: Right. So, Connie, you\u2019ve talked about how you think tech may be this kind of great equalizer, with this one-to-many model. It can provide access to the best instructors at any location, without the hefty buy-in of a year of tuition at Harvard. But, David, you\u2019ve also hypothesized that on-campus learning will become this increasingly important quality differentiator. So it may become a luxury good that only students with means can afford.</p>\n<p>How can we assess that fuzzy question of quality? Can online education provide the same level? And does ed tech pose a potential solution to the economic inequality?</p>\n<p><strong>David</strong>: I think that it\u2019s very important to distinguish between different types of education that have different purposes. So Josh mentioned master\u2019s degrees. And there are other things like coding bootcamps and other innovations out there in the ed tech space. And I think that the ones that you see achieving success and will continue to be successful are the ones that a) offer something specific that people are looking for. They know what they want and they\u2019re going for it. And b) they sort of run assuming that the people who enroll in them have as set of basic, whatever you want to call them, 21st century skills. They\u2019re good problem solvers. They\u2019re self-starters. They understand how to work in a team. They can think abstractly, etc.</p>\n<p>And I think all of those things are also learned in school and are often learned in college, in a four-year program or in high school. And that\u2019s exactly the kind of thing that the public needs to be subsidizing. Because no company wants to subsidize you to go learn something that\u2019s useful everywhere. They want to subsidize you to learn something that\u2019s useful for the job you\u2019re doing for them.</p>\n<p>But those skills are incredibly important for succeeding in the modern workplace. And my worry is that all of the budget cuts and other things that Josh and Connie mentioned are going to cut to the bone in terms of the really core important skills that education is teaching.</p>\n<p>I do think those things can be taught online. I don\u2019t think it can only be done in person. But I also think the in-person experience, particularly at public flagship universities and mid-tier public universities, is much more successful than people give it credit for. It provides a very high-quality education, in terms of future earnings, at relatively low cost.</p>\n<p>And many of the schools that educate our nation\u00e2\u0080\u0099s students are not the ones that are written about in the <em>New York Times</em> where you see, you know, climbing walls and lazy rivers and incredibly lavish extracurricular things that detract from the core purpose of education. They\u2019re actually pretty lean organizations that do a lot of teaching and provide a lot of student support without spending very much money. And they\u2019re about to get hit terribly by budget cuts, as Connie mentioned.</p>\n<p>And so, to me, I think ed tech and this general enterprise will all succeed much more when we, as a public tax base, subsidize those colleges to do their thing. And then we let the market do all the extra stuff, which I think it will do better than our public universities. That\u2019s how I would do it if I could play puppet master.</p>\n<p><strong>Josh</strong>: And kind of going back to David\u2019s point. There\u2019s not a lot of history in the Valley of being champions for the funding of public education, post-secondary education. In fact, if you look at the rhetoric, it\u2019s often not that.</p>\n<p>So I would say, you know, to the extent that academics feel comfortable and feel like we\u2019re actually partners and collaborators with the VC community and the funding community, I think it\u2019s very important to engage. Because David\u2019s exactly right, the crisis we have now in higher education is about defunding at the state level of post-secondary education. There\u2019s no technological silver bullet.</p>\n<p><strong>Connie</strong>: Point taken. Is funding the biggest problem in your mind then?</p>\n<p><strong>Josh</strong>: I think there\u2019s all sorts of entrenched challenges that higher ed faces, which we face as a country. I mean, David teaches about it\u00e2\u0080\u0094all the growing inequality. These are structural issues that we have to work on together.</p>\n<p><strong>David</strong>: Can I draw an analogy? So, you think about some of the most successful startups and Silicon Valley companies, almost all of them have relied on public infrastructure in some way. There\u2019s no Uber without public roads that work and get people from point A to point B reliably. And, you know, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an obvious point, but in many, many countries that doesn\u2019t exist. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not a tax base to fund roads where there aren\u2019t gigantic potholes in them. They need constant maintenance, etc.</p>\n<p>And there are many examples like that. We need public infrastructure for private enterprise to succeed. And that\u2019s our physical infrastructure. But education is our human infrastructure. And every ed tech startup will succeed better when we have more self-directed learners as a baseline pool of people who are interested. And that\u2019s what public education does. And if we don\u2019t invest in it as a society, we\u2019re eating our seed corn.</p>\n<p><strong>Connie</strong>: Yeah, I totally agree. And I know teachers are bearing a good chunk of the brunt. And, you know, I hear stories of a lot of teachers getting hired away for private education or for teaching small pods of children instead. So I do think the way our public school system and the resources they have today are going to look very different in a year.</p>\n<p><strong>Josh</strong>: I mean, I think it\u2019s a good discussion to have. The reputation of ed tech amongst academics and within higher ed is not great. Professors don\u2019t feel that great about the ed tech industry.</p>\n<p><strong>Lauren</strong>: Why do you think that is?</p>\n<p><strong>Josh</strong>: Well, what you often hear from the industry at large is that \u201cWe\u2019re gonna disrupt higher education.\u201d That \u201cYou guys are bloated. You\u2019re expensive. You\u2019ve been doing it the old way. You have to pivot. You have to evolve.\u201d</p>\n<p>And it really does not match the realities on the ground, where most education is public. Forty percent of students go to community colleges. There\u2019s a real mismatch. And I think often our communities are talking past each other.</p>\n<p><strong>Connie</strong>: I do think that you have to acknowledge, though, that there are people going to colleges, graduating, taking on a ton of debt, unable to find good jobs. And that also the quality of teaching drastically, even within a university, varies by your professor. So it\u2019s really hard to say that education is fine, as is. I would say there\u2019s still lots of low hanging fruit and ways to improve it.</p>\n<p>And it\u2019s not even just improving the status quo. It\u2019s also getting more students in the door. Again, figuring out the access question. How do we incent more students to go to community college? Is there a way that we can either drop the prices even further using technology or can we make the classes happen at the right schedule so a kid can still have a full-time daytime job to support his family, but still take classes at night?</p>\n<p><strong>Josh</strong>: I think community colleges have been leading the fight into online education. The reality is, though, no sector has had larger declines in public funding than community colleges.</p>\n<p><strong>Connie</strong>: Certainly. That\u2019s a huge problem. But theoretically, if you had every community college course available online to any student at any community college in the country for every single quarter, then it\u2019s hard to argue that more students wouldn\u2019t be taking more classes.</p>\n<p>I\u2019m also really curious what everyone thinks about: You start hearing rumors about schools potentially doing away with some standardized testing in terms of admissions. I\u2019m curious if there will need to be new signals. And would that need to require ed tech?</p>\n<p><strong>Josh</strong>: I think that it\u2019s great that we\u2019re getting rid of them. The SATs are somewhat predictive of first year success, not predictive of college success at all. And they\u2019re highly correlated with all sorts of other advantages.</p>\n<p>The more we move away from standardized tests, which only really benefit people based on privilege, the better we would be. And, you know, I think part of that is schools like the schools that David and I work at, we have to really ask ourselves are there ways that we can expand opportunity? Is it morally defensible anymore to judge our success by our scarcity? What role can we actually play in creating opportunity by growing? But to answer your question, I\u2019m all for getting rid of those tests.</p>\n<p><strong>Connie</strong>: Is there a potential tech solution that could still provide some kind of unbiased way to evaluate students?</p>\n<p><strong>David</strong>: I don\u2019t think it\u2019s possible to answer this question in a vacuum because it all depends on what replaces the test. Standardized tests are almost certainly biased, but are they more or less biased than what they replace? That is the question. And if you suddenly continue to do college admissions without a test, are people with privilege going to find other ways to signal that and to get ahead in the admissions game? Yes, they are. And so the question is, is this the most direct way to achieving the goal?</p>\n<p>So to me, getting rid of the SAT and the ACT is probably not by itself going to make a dent in this problem. My preferred solution would be if we think colleges ought to be more diverse, then they should just admit a more diverse class. And set that as the final goal, rather than this quite indirect solution of changing which criteria can and can\u2019t be used for admission. In other words, if you have a goal which is diversity, directly achieve that goal by deciding who you admit, and worry less about disparities in test scores and things like that.</p>\n<p><strong>Josh</strong>: Yeah, we worry way too much about who we admit. But there\u2019s this enormous range of who can succeed at various institutions. It\u2019s less about who comes in, at a pretty big range, and more about the supports and resources that are provided. The fact is that the wealthy institutions provide way more resources and support for learners. And they graduate at very high rates. At public and non-flagship public institutions, they can just cannot provide those resources for the learners. And you see that in attrition rates that are very high.</p>\n<p><strong>David</strong>: By the way, the scale of inequality in the resource allocation within higher education is way, way higher than in K to 12. So schools like Harvard and Dartmouth are spending about $100,000 per student per year on education. And schools like Bunker Hill Community College down a street from me are spending about $10,000 a year. That\u2019s 10x at the most elite schools. And then many people don\u2019t go to college at all, so they\u2019re basically getting zero.</p>\n<p>Now compare that to K to 12 education. The richest districts are maybe spending $15,000, $20,000 per student per year and the poorest districts are maybe spending $12,000. So there are gaps, but they\u2019re just way, way greater in higher ed.</p>\n<p><strong>Josh</strong>: I do think it\u2019s a very interesting question: what is the tech community\u2019s role? Like, if the real issue is this public disinvestment and inequalities in investment in higher education and class and racial lines, what is the role of the ed tech and the VC community in that? I don\u2019t know the answer.</p>\n<p><strong>Connie</strong>: There are startups already trying to offer that kind of curriculum for very low cost or free. And there are also startups that are working on worker training. I know people go to higher ed not just to get a job, but that is a big part of the incentive. And so, there are startups that are helping people become better sales reps, marketing reps, computer scientists, you name it.</p>\n<p><strong>David</strong>: There are also startups that are helping people apply to college, fill out their forms, and get into college and then get support when they\u2019re there. And that\u2019s and important piece of the landscape, too.</p>\n<p>So the way I think about it is\u2026 I think Josh is right that it\u2019s simplistic to say, that ed tech will disrupt higher education and just like leave it a wasteland. I don\u2019t think anybody really believes that, but that\u2019s often the caricature.</p>\n<p>But I do think that ed tech places very beneficial pressure on institutions of higher education to innovate. So, to me, what I like about the ed tech space is that it shows us new ways to be better within traditional educational institutions. I don\u2019t think that higher ed is on the verge of being completely turned upside down. I mean, some colleges will go out of business in the next couple of years because of COVID. And some of those were probably going to anyway. It\u2019s just going to accelerate the process.</p>\n<p>I don\u2019t see a future where everyone is doing college online or through new startups and things like that. But I do think that many of us don\u2019t teach as well as we should. You know, \u00e2\u0080\u009csage on the stage,\u00e2\u0080\u009d so to speak, is mostly what happens at a lot of large colleges, lecture-hall type classes. And that\u2019s not just a good way to learn. We sort of know that, but we don\u2019t face any pressure to change as tenured faculty members. And maybe nothing can make a tenured faculty member change.</p>\n<p>But if anything can, it\u2019s this idea that other people are out there getting a different and better type of education. So, to me, that\u2019s really the vision. It\u2019s that everything will be better because of a little bit of competitive pressure. And I think that\u2019s already happening.</p>\n<p><strong>Connie</strong>: And I think ed tech also encompasses tools, right? It\u2019s not necessarily about replacing the teacher. It could even be just the clicker you check so you can track student attendance. Or other ways to make sure that people are abiding by the honor policy.</p>\n<p>I\u2019ll give you an example. I was talking to a high school teacher. And she was explaining how even just having Google Classroom show automatically when every student has submitted the homework\u00e2\u0080\u0094it\u2019s timestamped\u00e2\u0080\u0094has saved her tremendously in terms of all the arguments she used to have with parents.</p>\n<p>Parents would argue that their kids\u00e2\u0080\u0099 grades were not accurate. And now she can just open Google Classroom and show, \u201cHey, the kid did not hand this assignment.\u201d \u201cHey, this assignment was handed in three days late.\u201d And so even something like that, it\u2019s just a small tool, but has significantly helped her in managing her classroom. I feel like there are other ways that tech can be helpful and beneficial to the existing system.</p>\n<p><strong>David</strong>: I totally agree. And I think the other reason why I\u2019m optimistic about not just public higher education or traditional higher education, but education in general, is if you look at the history of technological change, one thing you can learn is there are some products that when we get more innovative at making them at less cost, we don\u2019t want more of them. Like food.</p>\n<p>So, you know, a hundred years ago, 40 percent of all jobs in U.S. were in agriculture. And now it\u2019s less than 2 percent because we\u2019ve got more productive in making food and we only need so much. So now we just devote fewer resources in the economy to making food. But education and healthcare and few other things are not like that. When we get richer and more prosperous we want more of it.</p>\n<p>So I don\u2019t think education as a sector is going anywhere. I think there\u2019s going to be more space for everybody. I think that a lot of these innovations in the ed tech space are going to exist on top of traditional institutions, not replace them.</p>\n<p><strong>Lauren</strong>: Many teachers on the ground do balk at this top down infiltration of big tech in education without baseline classroom experience. What should technologists in this space know, from an educator\u2019s perspective? If you\u2019re addressing ed tech founders, technologists in the space\u00e2\u0080\u0094what should they know that they don\u2019t?</p>\n<p><strong>Josh</strong>: Yeah, we like talking to people in the ed tech world, we like people in the VC world because you guys are all about change. You have all these new ideas. And we don\u2019t think that the status quo is what it should be. We are in this game because we believe that higher education should be an engine of mobility. But where the conversation often breaks down is that there\u2019s a mismatch in understanding of our time scales. So we\u2019re looking at very long time scales with our institutions. We believe in that.</p>\n<p>And also, in higher education we never start with the technology. Technology for us is just a tool. We don\u2019t even really talk about online or blended or residential. You use the best methods for what\u2019s appropriate at the time. It\u2019s not actually reaching faculty in ways that they feel like it\u2019s supportive and helpful to them and not threatening.</p>\n<p><strong>Lauren</strong>: How could that be better? I agree with you, I feel like there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a real divide between the tech and the actual educators.</p>\n<p><strong>Josh</strong>: I think that if our communities are going to come together in a more authentic way we have to talk about where are the issues of access and cost and quality. Find that common ground, and then figure out together how we can create shared value with the expertise and the resources and the capital that we can all bring to this.</p>\n<p>And there\u2019s not really a space for that. If you look at the ed tech conferences like ASU GSV or South by Southwest, it\u2019s all this about \u00e2\u0080\u009cdisrupting higher education.\u00e2\u0080\u009d And, you know, we\u2019re sitting here saying, \u201cWell, we don\u2019t really want to disrupt higher education. We want to <em>invest</em> in higher education.\u201d So I think our language just misses each other, often.</p>\n<p><strong>Connie</strong>: I agree. The language is very polarizing right now and it should change. I think ed tech\u2019s role should be to improve, and everyone wants to improve education But it doesn\u2019t necessarily mean to replace or to disrupt it in a negative sense.</p>\n<p><strong>David</strong>: I have one thing I would like to communicate to the ed tech community.\u00c2\u00a0 I would love to see folks focus more on curriculum and less on the delivery model. You know, everybody says things like, \u201cA lot of the things I do on the job, I never learned in school.\u201d Or, \u201cI had to learn on the fly things that I never learned in the classroom.\u201d And that\u2019s true for a lot of people.</p>\n<p>So why don\u2019t we have more education that is actually new content, new curriculum, that the public school system is not covering? Just to give one example: for years and years, the standard for high school math that you take if you\u2019re good at math is calculus. And only a few people take probability and statistics. But probability and statistics is far, far, far more important for life success at this point, given the growth in data science, given the importance of data for making decisions for managers. We should be teaching that in every high school in the country. And if we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not going to do that, we should have ed tech focusing on delivering good content to teach numerical reasoning, decision-making under uncertainty, probability and statistics to fill the void that is left in our public high schools. I would love to see more talk of curriculum innovation.</p>\n<p><strong>Connie</strong>: Which by the way, though, I was really shocked that you said that, David, because I would have thought that focusing on the curriculum might feel even more threatening to the existing system and professors and teachers today.</p>\n<p><strong>David</strong>: Well, I\u2019ll speak for myself, maybe it is. But for me, that\u2019s not threatening, that\u2019s an opportunity for collaboration because there are faculty all across the country who have knowledge about content that isn\u2019t in the curriculum that is widely taught that can be communicated.</p>\n<p>But, you know, we don\u2019t speak the language that the public understands without a lot of practice. And most of us are not good communicators\u00e2\u0080\u0094or, at least, we can be better at it. Part of that is that we\u2019re not just trained to do it. You know, no one teaches us how to write a good op-ed, or how to communicate, how to do a podcast. We sort of have to learn on our own.</p>\n<p>But there\u2019s so much knowledge and expertise embedded in the university that needs to be brought out. And that would require ed tech to work closely with people. There\u2019s just so much interesting content that could be made more available. Like, if somebody were to work with me, and say, \u201cOh, you know, you teach this class on economic inequality. How can we make it speak and live to people?\u201d I don\u2019t have time to do that. But I\u2019d love to work with somebody to do that.</p>\n<p><strong>Connie</strong>: But if we took that to the extreme and, say, we had the perfect curriculum for that particular course and then we offered it to every university. Doesn\u2019t that threaten the professor in some way, because now every school has access to the same curriculum?</p>\n<p><strong>David</strong>: Well, ultimately, the professor isn\u2019t the constituency that we should be interested in. It\u2019s the student.</p>\n<p><strong>Connie</strong>: I agree with that.</p>\n<p><strong>David</strong>: If the cost is making some tenured professors feel threatened, I think that\u2019s a cost that I\u2019d be willing to pay in exchange for educating our nation\u2019s students and spreading the knowledge that exists in institutions of higher learning around more widely.</p>\n<p><strong>Josh</strong>: I think the issue is that most academics don\u2019t work at the kind of places that David and I work at. I agree with David that I\u2019m positive about the overall trajectory of higher education. But I\u2019m very concerned about the individual institutions, particularly the smaller, tuition-dependent private institutions.</p>\n<p>So while we have more students who attend public institutions, we actually have more private institutions. We have an amazing diversity of schools. And that kind of diversity has been a strength. In a world where everything is coming into one or two monopolistic providers\u00e2\u0080\u0094you know, you only have three cell phone providers and four airlines. One of the gifts of higher education is how diverse the ecosystem is.</p>\n<p>But right now, with COVID, it\u2019s very much accelerating the trends that put these schools at risk. We are seeing demographic headwinds, the costs are going up. And I think that if ed tech can come into this world to actually help out these institutions in some ways\u00e2\u0080\u00a6You really should not be paying attention to the places where David and I teach and work. We\u2019re really not that important. We should really be thinking about the big flagship universities and this diversity of schools. If you can do that, the faculty will not be so threatened because you\u2019re actually helping to save their institutions that help keep their jobs.</p>\n<p><strong>David</strong>: I mean, think about in all of those institutions. There are professors and departments all across the country who have developed a really thoughtful and interesting way of teaching certain material. And if you could combine it all into the perfect syllabus for certain topics that are not widely taught, you could really supercharge the amount of learning that people can access. And if it\u2019s threatening, so be it.</p>\n<p><strong>Lauren</strong>: Right. So that could then potentially lead to this culling of teachers where if we have online courses taught by the \u201cbest\u201d instructors, that could make lesser lectures obsolete or redundant.</p>\n<p><strong>David</strong>: Well, just to piggyback on that, I do think that you would have superstar lecturers, but I don\u2019t think that would make us all obsolete. I think what would happen is when you would rather watch a lecture from somebody who\u2019s better at teaching it than as I am, my world transforms. I\u2019m no longer the lecturer. Instead, my job is to basically guide people through the material and to meet them where they are in their learning and to form a human connection with them that makes them want to turn the assignment in. Because they come to my office hours and make a personal question with me.</p>\n<p>I mean, if you think about teachers that have touched your lives, just imagine the teachers in your life that meant the most to you. It was a mix of the personal connection and the stuff that they taught you in classroom. It wasn\u2019t like, \u201cOh, my gosh, you know, Mrs. Hicks was the very best first-grade teacher in terms of teaching me phonics.\u201d Your probably don\u2019t remember what they taught you. You remember the human connection you had with them. And I don\u2019t think that\u2019s ever gonna be replaced.</p>\n<p><strong>Connie</strong>: I remember hearing an argument that everyone should pre-watch the lecture beforehand and then just do their homework in the classroom. And that guided time with the teacher would be far more valuable.</p>\n<p><strong>Lauren</strong>: Interesting. It\u2019s true that so much of what we get out of education is that personal connection, that mentorship. Though, Connie, I know some startups are actually trying to tap into that mentorship model as well.</p>\n<p><strong>Connie</strong>: Yeah. There\u2019s a lot of startups right now that are trying to offer online tutoring and peer groups even for learning different topics to help encourage each other or answer each other\u2019s questions. And in the online model, I think the value proposition is you are able to access people who don\u2019t just live a couple of miles from you. So if you live in a place where you didn\u2019t have access to great tutors, you can now still hire a tutor from one of the best universities or one of the best schools who can still teach at a reasonable price.</p>\n<p><strong>Lauren</strong>: I do want to get to more into the actual design of education. From a research perspective, what should educators know when they\u2019re delving into this world of online learning? Many educators are using Zoom by default. How much is the effectiveness of an online learning curriculum impacted by that interface, or what you might call the delivery method? Would students and educators benefit from some kind of custom platform that was designed from an education-first perspective versus a Zoom, which was not originally intended for this purpose?</p>\n<p><strong>Josh</strong>: I mean, the way we\u2019re using Zoom now in education is never how people who think about online education thought this should be or would be or could be. Basically, when you design a good online course, most of that work is asynchronous. You\u2019re building active learning, you\u2019re building discussion, you\u2019re building formative assessments, you\u2019re building peer learning. Mostly it\u2019s asynchronous. And then you can combine some synchronous conversations, discussions. It never works well to lecture. But it\u2019s complementary and it\u2019s really for the relationship building.</p>\n<p>What we found with the pivot to remote teaching and learning with COVID is schools didn\u2019t have time to develop these really well thought out asynchronous courses where everything you do is online. There was sometimes, too much emphasis on Zoom classes that were not very good. And it burned people out. And so if you assume what we\u2019re seeing now is actually indicative of anything, you\u2019re getting a false negative.</p>\n<p><strong>Lauren</strong>: I think that\u2019s a point well taken. But if Zoom, as you say, is just not working, what will the improvement be? You mentioned we\u2019ll likely see improvement this fall. In that you know a lot about the research of online ed and you both have done it.</p>\n<p><strong>David</strong>: My answer is, ask me in a couple of months because I\u2019m teaching the first year in master\u2019s in public policy curriculum at the Kennedy School\u00e2\u0080\u0099s stats course. I\u2019m teaching it with some colleagues who have done it before and have already started to use blending tools, so it\u2019s a pretty successful model that I\u2019m stepping into, luckily. But this will be a challenge because you\u2019re trying to teach something that actually requires a lot interactivity.</p>\n<p>You know, I can make some asynchronous content. But when you\u2019re working through problems and explaining concepts, part of the challenge when you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re in a classroom is to intuit when you need to slow down, when you need to speed up, when you need to step back and explain something differently. And a lot of good teaching is not about what you prepare ahead of time. It\u2019s how you react, at least in my experience. And, like, reading a room.</p>\n<p>And my observation from doing a lot of seminars is that the four of us right here, I don\u2019t find it to be meaningfully worse in terms of reading your reactions and talking with you. But when you get to above 10 or 12 or so, it\u2019s just very hard to read the room and read people\u2019s faces and get a sense for what happening. You don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have any body language. You can\u2019t look at 15 faces at once. And I just find it, frankly, very difficult to pace correctly.</p>\n<p>And I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s a technological solution to that. It\u2019s just something about when you\u2019re in a room with people sitting there. You can pick up more information from scanning the crowd. And I think that\u2019s a real limitation of online teaching, at least for me. So, I would really be open to technology that helps me do that better.</p>\n<p><strong>Josh</strong>: The challenge of it is it doesn\u2019t it doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t scale very well. Having that real, authentic education that is personal and transformative where it\u2019s built on relationships, it\u2019s expensive to do because, like, David only has so much time in a day.</p>\n<p><strong>David</strong>: I never sleep.</p>\n<p><strong>Josh</strong>: And so it really doesn\u2019t scale very well. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s figuring out how you can actually use the affordances of the technology and realize the limitation.</p>\n<p><strong>Lauren</strong>: That\u2019s a great point. I think it\u2019s one that you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve both made, which is that some of the inherent features of a great education are very difficult to scale up. Connie, how would you respond to that?</p>\n<p><strong>Connie</strong>: As David was describing reading the room, I couldn\u2019t agree more when you are talking about, say, 30 students or less. Just witnessing my daughter\u2019s kindergarten online experience through Zoom in the spring, it\u2019s hard for the teachers to control 30 5-year-olds. Really, really hard.</p>\n<p>But I can also see the flip argument. Let\u2019s say you have a lecture hall of 500, 600 students, even being able to see the attendance. And technologically, there\u2019s no reason why you wouldn\u2019t be able to use software to figure out if the students are paying attention or making eye contact. So theoretically, you should be able to read the room in a very, very large class sizes, potentially better than even in person. So I think there is still an argument that tech can still even help you read the room more than what you see today.</p>\n<p><strong>David</strong>: Yeah, I definitely think that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s possible.</p>\n<p><strong>Josh</strong>: I just wrote a book called <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Learning-Innovation-Future-Education-Tech-edu/dp/1421436639/r\"><em>Learning Innovation and the Future of Higher Education</em></a>. One of the things we talked a lot about in the book is how education is changing to become much more of a team sport. Like David and I, when we went to grad school, we certainly learned to teach the way we were taught by our professors, which means, not at all. We learned our discipline; I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m a sociologist and demographer by training. I didn\u2019t learn anything about teaching.</p>\n<p>Now, at certainly at schools with more resources, they\u2019ve been able to bring in people who are learning designers, structural designers, media experts, those kinds of things. Really, teaching and learning is become a team sport. I think that\u2019s a positive, because education is getting much better.</p>\n<p>I also think, you know, one of the underlying issues that we think about when we\u2019re talking about higher education and the future of technology is the growth in inequality. We\u2019re seeing that the schools with the most resources are really able to bear COVID and the current trends.</p>\n<p>Schools that don\u2019t have the resources to bring in all these folks to work with faculty around designing online courses, low residency, blended courses, you know, it\u2019s a much different type of thing. So it\u2019s a real question about how do you bring those resources to places that really don\u2019t have the money to pay these kinds of folks, now that education is changing? I don\u2019t know the answer to that. I think it\u2019s a really difficult problem, but I do think we\u2019ve seen the inequalities grow and grow over the last five or six months.</p>\n<p><strong>David</strong>: I agree with that. Although, I do think what probably will be a solution to improvement is the sort of complementarity between people who have content mastery and the tools. You still need a person to figure out the best way to reach people who teach a complex topic like, let\u2019s say economic inequality or something.</p>\n<p>So I\u2019m an economist by training and I never encountered economics until college. And there is an AP micro and macroeconomics curriculum, but most people never realize until they take an economics class that economics is not just money and finance, that it\u2019s actually the study of human behavior and choice under constraints and that economists have interesting things to say about all kinds of social issues.</p>\n<p>I started teaching a freshman seminar at Harvard about economic inequality, basically for the sole purpose to introduce to freshmen at Harvard, a few at a time, this idea that economics can be the study of social problems and of human behavior and that it\u2019s far more interesting than most people think. I would love to get some of that insight into the hands of high school students and middle school students. You can make that stuff accessible to people without it being technical. The core insights of economics are not about math and abstract probability. They\u2019re about human behavior and things like sunk costs, etc.</p>\n<p>But in order for me to entrepreneurially go and create that content and go take a roadshow around\u2026there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just no way that professors have the capability of doing that or the time to do it. And that\u2019s a place where innovation could. And maybe there\u2019s not enough money to be made in it, but it would just be an incredible benefit to society if we could have innovative content creators pair with people who have content expertise and create stuff that really spoke to people\u00e2\u0080\u0094multimedia content that kids are interested in watching.</p>\n<p>And then you\u2019ve got other tools that let you, you know, annotate slides on an iPad. Or, they\u2019ve got these beautiful light boards where you can teach in reverse and look at the camera while you are teaching and write on them. Those are all tools that by themselves don\u2019t do anything. But if they\u2019re combined with people who have content knowledge, can be leveraged to teach more people at the same cost or to increase productivity.</p>\n<p><strong>Lauren</strong>: So we\u2019ve talked about tech should play a supporting role in in-person education. This is an interesting moment in time in that tech has to play a much greater role than I think many educators desire or are comfortable with.</p>\n<p>But as we come out of this and we go back to normal life, do you think this is an inflection point for ed tech? Is it just a temporary, inconvenient scramble that will eventually reset to the way that we were or do you think that there will be lasting changes?</p>\n<p><strong>David</strong>: I think that people prefer to be educated in person, many people do. And so I don\u2019t think the in-person market for education is going to disappear or go into a long-term decline. But I do think there are going to be a lot of people who understand that there are many more options available to them in the tech space, that if they can\u2019t be on campus for whatever reason, there\u2019s a much richer landscape out there than most people realize.</p>\n<p>So, to be optimistic, I think what we\u2019ll see is more education happening in a lot more different ways, rather than the tech sector competing away in-person education. That\u2019s my hope and I actually do think that\u2019s what\u2019ll happen. But I could be wrong.</p>\n<p><strong>Connie</strong>: K to 12, I think almost everyone universally prefers in-person. I think the kids prefer in-person. I think the teachers prefer in-person. And I think the parents very, very much prefer in-person.</p>\n<p><strong>David</strong>: Second that.</p>\n<p><strong>Connie</strong>: So I feel like K to 12, while we are all surviving in an online context, the preference will be to go back to school, especially in that social interaction for young kids is so critical to their development. And my hope is that a lot of this disruption at this moment in time will result in better curriculum and allow for the best curriculum to get to all of the teachers. Because if you think about, especially K to 12 and the common core programs, most schools are teaching the same topics, right? The same kindergartener is learning about how plants grow in one school and learning about it in a slightly different way in another school. But why aren\u2019t those teachers having better collaboration tools so they can share tips and learnings and content and the best YouTube videos on the topic that they found?</p>\n<p><strong>Lauren</strong>: Josh, I want to get your view as well. Is this temporary and we\u2019re going to reset or do you think we\u2019ll see lasting changes in the way that we learn?</p>\n<p><strong>Josh</strong>: Ah, yes. In terms of how are we going to come out, I\u2019ll say something very positive, in that over the last few months what we\u2019ve really seen is that professors and learners have had to have a different kind of relationship. We\u2019ve all been at home, we\u2019ve seen how complicated and crazy our lives are and how difficult it is. I\u2019m hoping that as we come back and when we come back that professors and students will have a better understanding of each other as people and how complicated and difficult our lives are and that we\u2019ll have more of an ethos towards care and caring for each other.</p>\n<p><strong>Connie</strong>: Oh, I think parents appreciate teachers far more now than they did before.</p>\n<p><strong>David</strong>: Totally, agree.</p>\n<p><strong>Connie</strong>: They\u2019re much more grateful to teachers now than before.</p>\n<p><strong>Lauren</strong>: Well, and the whole ed tech debate brings up an interesting dichotomy in that teachers are recognized as being largely underpaid\u00e2\u0080\u0094I say that being married to one. But also, in the ed tech space, they\u2019re also expensive and there\u2019s ways that we can bring down those costs with online models.</p>\n<p><strong>Connie</strong>: But if you take what David mentioned about teachers playing a different kind of role, the guided role, there\u2019s still always going to be a need for the smaller group or one-on-one interaction. It\u2019s indisputable that people do learn certain topics better one-on-one.</p>\n<p><strong>David</strong>: That\u2019s right and I think that would be a really great development because, speaking for myself, that\u2019s really where I derive joy from teaching is that moment when I see understanding in students\u2019 eyes and make a connection with them. And that\u2019s something that\u2026whether it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s online or in person, it\u2019s just the joy of teaching. And if we can immerse ourselves more fully in that using the tools of technology, then I\u2019m all for it.</p>\n<p><strong>Lauren</strong>: Can you have that same emotional connection through a Zoom screen as you can an in-person classroom?</p>\n<p><strong>David</strong>: I think you can. I mean, I would prefer to be in person, but I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve felt at times in the past few months that connection with students or with colleagues.</p>\n<p>I mean, I think if nothing else, the one thing you don\u2019t get online is serendipity. Just think about when students file into the classroom there\u2019s that five minutes before class starts and people connect, you know, \u201cHow was your weekend?\u201d And they talk about this and that and then you have that at the end, they come after to talk to the professor. I mean, you can engineer that in the online space and be thoughtful about it, but when you\u2019re in-person it just happens like magic.</p>\n<p><strong>Lauren</strong>: Josh, you seem slightly more skeptical of that.</p>\n<p><strong>Josh</strong>: I mean, I don\u2019t want my college kids having online, I want them on campus. I\u2019m the director of online programs and strategy but I know that you can\u2019t replace what happens when people get together. It\u2019s such an important thing, and it shouldn\u2019t just be a luxury for the few.</p>\n<p>I really do think there\u2019s a lot going now with these nonprofit for-profit partnerships and that we all need to work together because it\u2019s such a difficult challenge. We all have a stake in this. This is not someone else\u2019s issue. This is what we have to do, and we\u2019re not going to be able to do it on our own.</p>\n<p>Nonprofit colleges and universities, we need to be part of a larger ecosystem and we need to be working together. Software is eating the world, but maybe education is eating the world also.</p>\n<p><strong>Lauren</strong>: Thank you all so much for joining us in the \u201ca16z Podcast.\u201d It\u2019s been a pleasure.</p>\n<p><strong>David</strong>: Thanks for having us.

I\u2019m Jon. I\u2019m a general partner at a16z. Today we are talking about topics that I know are near and dear, and on everyone\u2019s minds here at GDC, which are NFTs, Web3, and the impact in games. So, I\u2019m honored to be joined by two luminaries in the Web3 games industry. Aleks Larsen, the cofounder and COO of Sky Mavis, which is behind Axie Infinity, and Gabby Dizon, the cofounder of Yield Guild Games.</p>\n<p>Let\u2019s jump into it. Aleks and Gabby, we\u2019ve heard a lot this past year about how NFTs and Web3 games are totally going to change the way people game, and the way the industry evolves. Let\u2019s break it down into specifics. First, from a player perspective, what are some of the things that we can do today with NFTs or other Web3 primitives that were not possible before?</p>\n<p><strong style=\"color: #5bc3f5\">Gabby:</strong> Speaking as a player from a developing country, the Philippines has always been one of the soft launch countries for games because there\u2019s a lot of people who like to play who are very active on the social side. But people weren\u2019t always able to receive real-world rewards for the time and skill they spent in-game. Now with NFTs in games, people can own their assets, and then participate in the game economy. So, that\u2019s been huge for people from my country and other developing markets that have been able to participate in game economies, such as in Axie Infinity. It has allowed them to own digital assets that have their own value in the form of NFTs, like Axies or tokens. It\u2019s just really changed the way people look at games. I think almost 2% of Filipinos play Axie Infinity, so it\u2019s been a huge game-changer for the entire population.</p>\n<p><strong style=\"color: #93ca15\">Aleks:</strong> I think one of the things we see in Axie is higher engagement, retention, and that people actually care more about these assets more than they did in the past when they were leased by the game studios. When we\u2019re looking at what an NFT actually is, it\u2019s a part of your digital identity. So, I truly believe that part of why we made Axie and Sky Mavis is that we want people to own their own data. And when you\u2019re starting your journey online, especially younger people, a lot of that is in games. Whenever you play a game, I firmly believe that you should have something that belongs to you. And this is represented by an NFT.</p>\n<p>That has meaning for many people. And it\u2019s not actually only about the monetary value. It\u2019s about the emotional connection that people have to these game assets. That in the past, you used to just disappear if the games shut down. Now, at least you have some tangible proof that, \u201cHey, I actually did this in that game.\u201d That has meaning. So, to me, that\u2019s really important. And I think that was never really possible before, at least in the same way that we see now. So while the money is what draws people in, I believe that they will stay for everything else that\u2019s surrounding these, and making them unique.</p>\n<p><strong style=\"color: #ed8c00\">Jon:</strong> It\u2019s very interesting that one of the first things that you mentioned was ownership. The concept that these are digital assets that no one can take away from you. If the game shuts down, if Axie Infinity closes tomorrow, your Axies would still be in your wallet. You can trade them and they have some intrinsic value. A common pushback that we get from Web2 developers, of which there are many in the audience today, is that digital ownership might just be a policy change that Web2 game developers could make for an existing game. For example, in World of Warcraft, they could just allow people to trade accounts with gold. In Diablo, there was a real money auction house for a time period, where people could buy and sell weapons and armors that they found in game. If you could take it one level deeper, what is it beyond just the ability to own and trade your digital items that is special about Web3 and NFTs?</p>\n<p><strong style=\"color: #93ca15\">Aleks:</strong> It actually ties to what I said in terms of identity. Players are spending years grinding for game assets in games like World of Warcraft. The items they acquire have value to them, because of the time it took to get them, rather than y for the sales value. If they then quit the game but want to come back later to prove to someone that they did all these cool things it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not certain they are there. The game developer could easily have deleted those game assets.</p>\n<p><strong style=\"color: #5bc3f5\">Gabby:</strong> Yeah. NFTs are digital property. It\u2019s the digital analogue of owning a Magic card, or owning a baseball. You can play by different kinds of rules, or flavors of magic with Magic cards. You can also completely make up your own game around those assets. And the same thing goes with baseball. You can play it in a structured way with your friends, or you can play it in your backyard. Having NFTs transfers that concept of having digital ownership to the digital world.</p>\n<p><strong style=\"color: #ed8c00\">Jon:</strong> And from a developer\u2019s perspective, if you are building games today, how should they be thinking about NFTs and exploring Web3? We\u2019re seeing a massive flight of game developers moving from the Web2 world into Web3. What is it that\u2019s motivating them? What\u2019s exciting?</p>\n<p><strong style=\"color: #93ca15\">Aleks:</strong> We speak to a lot of game developers and they\u2019re curious. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHow did this innovation happen? What is the 2-token model? What is SLP?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Truth be told, a lot of it is just about experimentation, and trying to figure out what this new technology enables. For game developers coming into the space, they have to view tokens really, really carefully. And I emphasize to many entrepreneurs, especially those who are trying to raise money by selling tokens, just how important these tokens are. Because the liquidity that players immediately have, or investors immediately have, is something that you as a game studio or developer will have to defend over time.<br/>\nRather than selling NFTs, just as a light cash grab, it\u2019s much better to actually reward early community members, and tie them into your community by giving them NFTs. And I think that actually flips the script. Because the moment that you\u2019re selling something to a player, they feel like you owe them something. But the moment that you give something to a player, they feel like they almost owe you something in return. And that feeling of gratitude is insanely strong. And that\u2019s how you can actually start building some very core communities.</p>\n<p><strong style=\"color: #5bc3f5\">Gabby:</strong> My take on the difference between Web2 to Web3 is that you really start with the assets as the base layer\u00e2\u0080\u0094the NFT is your base layer for IP, for intellectual property. Instead of thinking of the game, and then thinking of what assets you can put there, you actually think of what is the base asset itself? Let\u2019s take Yuga Labs, for example. You have the Bored Ape, and then from there, you get airdropped Serum. And then you can create a second NFT, which is the Mutant. So, you\u2019re actually creating your world one-by-one from those assets. And when you have that base asset, you can think, what does it mean to create a three-month game experience for my community, or a six-month game experience, or a two-year game experience? Maybe an MMO that takes five years to build. All using that same base layer of assets to reward your community, not only with different experiences, but also different assets that they can get from holding your base asset.</p>\n<p><strong style=\"color: #ed8c00\">Jon:</strong> I find Yuga Labs and what they\u2019re doing with ApeCoin to be really fascinating, because I think it\u2019s a great example of bottom-up game building. They\u2019ve basically given the community a set of primitives, the NFTs themselves, and told them, \u201cHey, we want to build a universe around this.\u201d And then they\u2019ve given commercial rights, in many cases, to the NFT holders. How do you reconcile that with the traditional model of game development? When you have a centralized game studio, an organization like Sky Mavis, which maintains a creative vision that\u2019s balanced in the game, to make sure that things are fun to play, there are no cheaters, and so on, do you feel like these approaches are at odds? How do they reconcile?</p>\n<p><strong style=\"color: #93ca15\">Aleks:</strong> The Sky Mavis approach is actually hybrid in a sense. When I\u2019m looking at Yuga Labs, what are they doing? They\u2019re giving away the commercial rights to use Apes in various things. Which is great\u00e2\u0080\u0093you can unlock creativity. As a game developer from the start, we are trying to progressively decentralize. At Axie, users can earn significant monetary value, but if they want to participate deeper in the ecosystem, they will need an agreement with us. We\u2019re trying to make it so that the incentives are aligned with those who hold the underlying token, like the AXS, in our case. And the revenue that is generated, that either goes back to the players, or it gets put into our treasury, which then benefits the token holders.<br/>\nNow, for ApeCoin, I have stronger opinions about that because I\u2019m not bullish on currency tokens. I believe that tokens need to have a clear way for people to collect some kind of value, whether that be money streams or to govern the platform. Just using them for trade or bartering is not really something that I believe will make the price go up, which is what a lot of this is actually about. I would rather focus on, especially if you\u2019re issuing a token, why do people want to hold this? Make it so that people want to hold your asset for a long period of time, rather than just having it as a currency.</p>\n<p><strong style=\"color: #5bc3f5\">Gabby:</strong> It\u2019s really difficult to build a game. But there\u2019s a lot of things that NFTs and Web3 communities empower. One of my favorite examples is RTFKT and CloneX, which just started as a bunch of NFTs. But then they dropped another NFT, Space Pods, which is like a physical 3D space that people can decorate. A lot of people have actually entered as creators, and are decorating their own pods, and even learning Blender to do so. So, having your community feel like, \u201cI am a real owner of this economy, and I can co-create with the developers.\u201d And of course, you can set some boundaries there. There\u2019s a core game experience that only the developer can create.</p>\n<p><strong style=\"color: #93ca15\">Aleks:</strong> The structure.</p>\n<p><strong style=\"color: #5bc3f5\">Gabby:</strong> \u2026. But if you can create a sandbox for the community to be really playful, and to have ownership, you\u2019ll really see long-term loyalty that you won\u2019t be able to see in any other kind of game.</p>\n<p><strong style=\"color: #ed8c00\">Jon:</strong> One of the challenges that we have today in Web3 is that there just aren\u2019t that many players. To use a personal example, two nights ago I beat Elden Ring, which is a best-selling premium console game. They recently announced that 12 million people played Elden Ring last month. To the best of my knowledge though, there isn\u2019t yet a blockchain game with 12 million players cumulative, let alone on a monthly active basis. What do you think needs to happen in order to have an Elden Ring level of success in blockchain gaming?</p>\n<p><strong style=\"color: #93ca15\">Aleks:</strong> Right now in Axie, we have about 1.6 million daily active players. And that is without having the game on any app stores. You can\u2019t download the game on iOS. The only way to get it on Android is to have the APK downloaded directly. Having said that, what happens when we can reduce the barriers of entry even more? And it\u2019s not about earning a whole lot of money as a developer, it\u2019s about giving something back because forever gamers have been taken for granted, and actually exploited. They\u2019re being squeezed to the max, especially by mobile game studios.</p>\n<p><strong style=\"color: #5bc3f5\">Gabby:</strong> I\u2019m a mobile game developer, by the way.</p>\n<p><strong style=\"color: #93ca15\">Aleks:</strong> Speaking as a mobile game developer right now, we went down that path and figured out that it\u2019s actually not the game developers who are the worst. It\u2019s the middlemen. It\u2019s the way that you have to spend money on ads. Now, what\u2019s possible with blockchain games is that you can go to market directly to the consumer by dropping tokens, which is why Axie Infinity has been able to get so many users in such a short period of time. We went from 36,000 to now 2.5 million by the end of last year. By reducing the barriers even more, people are able to play for free but still experience the magic that\u2019s surrounding Axie. That\u2019s what it\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll take to get to those numbers.</p>\n<p><strong style=\"color: #5bc3f5\">Gabby:</strong> I represent how players are now engaging with gaming guilds, so I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll talk about that. We started YGG on top of the Axie community. The community figured out that you could actually lend NFTs to other people without giving wallet access away, basically, by this kind of two-login system. If I gave you access to a username and password, without giving you access to my blockchain wallet, you could play the game, experience the game, and earn value without having to trust the person with your assets. So, we did that starting 2020 and now this has really blown up with Axie Infinity in the Philippines and other parts of the world. We are kind of set up as a player community, or run as a DAO (decentralized autonomous organization) that is now purchasing assets of different kinds of games. We\u2019ve bought assets in over 40 games now. Whether it\u2019s a card game, or strategy, or RPG, we now have the assets for players to come in and enjoy these games, and earn it without having to buy an NFT to start. Of course, if they like it a lot, then they might buy something afterwards.<br/>\nWe\u2019re seeing now that YGG has grown tremendously, a lot of it in developing areas such as Southeast Asia, India, Latin America, where people are playing these games and earning supplemental income. But I think we\u2019re going to see an evolution similar to a World of Warcraft guild with a bank account. The guild itself may buy a castle or a kingdom, and it will produce buildings. And people will come in and harvest resources. The competitive people will be fighters that will be doing PvP against other people. So, having that kind of guild layer on top of digital assets gives you new gameplay primitives to play with that you\u2019ve never seen before.</p>\n<p><strong style=\"color: #ed8c00\">Jon:</strong> Gabby, on the topic of DAOs, maybe just one contentious question\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 have DAOs today basically become web3 game publishers? If you\u2019re working on a new Web3 game, you want YGG to take a look at the token design, to go through the game design docs and sign off on it. And that way, your community, your scholars and scholarship managers, will all know that this is a legitimate project and they should put their time and money behind it. Do you think there is a world where DAOs actually become too powerful in that perspective? Because they\u2019ve actually become gatekeepers to future Web3 games and dApps in general, even outside of games. How do you think about that as you\u2019re structuring your company and growing?</p>\n<p><strong style=\"color: #5bc3f5\">Gabby:</strong> That\u2019s a really good question. I think the way to win and create value in Web3 is very different from how it was before. Before, if you had something proprietary, you wanted to gate it and charge for it, which is why Facebook and Google grew really big on top of their algorithms. In Web3, the way you grow is by compounding network effects, which means that if YGG comes in and helps a game launch, helps with a token design, and buys assets, we\u2019re not going to gatekeep and not let other guilds in. We\u2019re actually setting the design so that hundreds of other guilds can come in, enjoy the game, and have a thriving economy. We actually reduce the network effect, and therefore the value of what we\u2019re doing, by gatekeeping. This is really the core difference in creating value between Web2 to Web3.</p>\n<p><strong style=\"color: #ed8c00\">Jon:</strong> One final question for each of you, which is that there are a lot of Web2 developers in the audience who are crypto-curious, and want to learn more about Web3. What general advice would you have for them? How should they get started?</p>\n<p><strong style=\"color: #93ca15\">Aleks:</strong> I would make sure that fundamentally the game that you\u2019re designing is fun. That it can benefit from having an open or player-owned economy. And that the IP that you\u2019re trying to create has the potential to grow outside of just being that one thing. So, truth be told, NFTs are primitives that can be used as building blocks.t. The experiences are unlimited, if you do it right. But you need to start somewhere, so I would say start from the fundamentals and go from there.

Ben, welcome.\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">So, we\u2019re talking about culture, and I thought we\u2019d start with someone I know is one of your heroes, Andy Grove. People think of him as a management guru, but obviously the overlap between great management and building great culture is a lot. I thought it\u2019d be great to hear about what you have taken away from your many studies with Andy, including as it relates to culture.</span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><div data-toc-header=\"The management legacy of Intel's Andy Grove\" id=\"section--1\"></div>The management legacy of Intel\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Andy Grove</span></h3>\n<p><b>Ben Horowitz:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> I think people get culture confused with values on the wall. Integrity, we have each other\u2019s backs, all this kind of stuff that people put on the wall and then don\u2019t do. And so when you think about culture, I thought Bushido had the best definition, which is \u201cculture is not a set of beliefs, it\u2019s a set of actions.\u201d Andy was really good on that front. If you think about it, the reason it doesn\u2019t work to put in your annual review, or put values on the wall and so forth, is because culture is the little things. Somebody calls you\u00e2\u0080\u0094a colleague\u00e2\u0080\u0093Do you call him back in five minutes, in an hour, the next day? Or do you just drop him on the floor and never call him back at all? That\u2019s culture, and that drives a lot of things. Do you show up on time for meetings, or 5 minutes late, or 10 minutes late? These are the cultural things that actually end up driving what it really feels like to work there and what it\u2019s like to do business with you. Andy really understood that at an amazing level.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">He did things that seemed absurd when you hear about them. He would get to work at 8 in the morning and then see who was there. If someone wasn\u2019t there, he would write \u2019em up and then he would check their desk to see if it was clean. It was really important that you had a clean desk. Why do you care if somebody has a clean desk? It\u2019s Intel. Intel was about precision. The cost of a miss on a tape out is extraordinary. When you\u2019re about precision, how do you get that into the culture? It starts with: when I go to work, I need my desk to be clean because Andy cares about everything being right. Little things like that that he would do to set the whole tone.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll give you my favorite story from Andy. After he had retired and he was at the Grove Foundation, I went to go see him. It\u2019s a little office. The Grove Foundation was\u00e2\u0080\u0094as you would expect from Andy Grove\u00e2\u0080\u0094low key. He had one picture on the wall and it was this framed award, the Santa Clara Manufacturing Facility Leadership Award. He was </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Time</span></i> <i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Magazine</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> Man of the Year. He\u2019s one of the greatest CEOs, maybe the greatest CEO, in the history of Silicon Valley, and he\u2019s got this Santa Clara Manufacturing Facility Award for Leadership. I was like, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhy do you have that on the wall? Why\u2019d they give you the award? You\u2019re the CEO, why are they giving the CEO the Manufacturing Facility Award?\u00e2\u0080\u009d And he says, \u00e2\u0080\u009cBen,they were ranked the lowest in maintenance in all of Intel. They had the worst facility under spec. Terrible. So I go over there to talk to them about it. And they just start hitting me with all this bullshit about how they don\u2019t have the right resources and how this was unfair. And so I reach under my chair and I pull out a roll of toilet paper, and I put it on the desk. And I said, \u00e2\u0080\u0098when you\u2019re done cleaning up your bull, tell me when you\u2019re going to be up to spec.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u009d Within three months, it was the highest-rated facility at Intel.</span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><div data-toc-header=\"Why everyone remembers Bill Campbell\" id=\"section--2\"></div>Why everyone remembers Bill Campbell</span></h3>\n<p><b>David:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> Let\u2019s go from him to another dominant figure that still scares the hell outta me, Bill Campbell, and talk about some things that you\u2019ve taken away from Bill about building culture that are useful to share with people here.</span></p>\n<p><b>Ben:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> Bill was a very different guy than Andy Grove. When I look at Andy Grove, I, as a CEO, I don\u2019t know that I did anything better than him. He was so good at all aspects of that job. Just incredible. Bill wasn\u2019t like that. There were things he was good at, things he wasn\u2019t that good at, but the thing that he was great at, he was better at than anybody that I\u2019ve ever met. When you met him, he would get a read on you within three minutes and then he would remember you, your wife\u2019s name, your kids, where you grew up, all that stuff, forever. I still run into people who knew Bill Campbell, and they\u2019re all like, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Bill\u2019s the greatest guy in the world!</span></i></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Everybody loved that guy because he was so good at people skills. The only person I ever ran into who had that like him was Oprah. That\u2019s how good he was. He was Oprah-level at really understanding people. The thing that it translated into from a management standpoint was: one of the hardest things to do\u00e2\u0080\u0094and it\u2019s one of the most important things culturally\u00e2\u0080\u0094is when you\u2019re talking to somebody, realize you\u2019re not talking to that person, you\u2019re talking to everybody in the company. You have to represent the people who are not in the room. Bill was really good at that.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">When I was running LoudCloud, we did this big deal to get out of what would\u2019ve been a business that took us bankrupt by selling the services component to EDS and then becoming a software company.\u00c2\u00a0 I was talking to Bill on the phone saying, \u201cwe just did this big deal and it\u2019s really exciting, we\u2019re going to announce it.\u201d And he goes, \u201cyou\u2019re selling a lot of the employees to EDS, and you\u2019re laying a bunch of people off.\u00e2\u0080\u009d I was like, \u201cyeah, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got to do that the next day.\u201d He goes, \u201cno. You can\u2019t go to New York.\u201d I was like, \u201cwhat do you mean?\u201d He said, \u201call anybody in the company\u2019s going to want to know is where they stand. As soon as that news comes out, you can\u2019t wait a minute. You have to tell them simultaneously with the announcement.\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Of course, as soon as he said it, I knew it was right. I sent [Marc] Andreessen to New York to do the announcement and I did a layoff and told everybody where they were. We ended up recovering as a company and selling it to Hewlett Packard for $1.6B, but none of that would\u2019ve happened if I had gone to New York. It was that important a moment, and he could see it so obviously. He really always started there. How is everybody going to understand what happens?\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><div data-toc-header=\"How culture gave Okta the competitive advantage\" id=\"section--3\"></div>How culture gave Okta the competitive advantage</span></h3>\n<p><b>David:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> Let\u2019s talk about how CEOs go from the struggle\u00e2\u0080\u0094both struggling to be a good CEO and struggling with the company\u00e2\u0080\u0094to being a great CEO.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">One thing that I think happens when people come to a conference like this is, they see people like you and they think, \u201cI\u2019m not like that. How do I get to be that good?\u201d In particular, I thought it\u2019s interesting to talk about Todd McKinnon and Okta. I often say Todd\u2019s the most improved CEO I have ever worked with. You were a CEO coach, so what\u2019d you do?</span></p>\n<p><b>Ben:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> I think you got to give more credit to Todd, but here\u2019s the thing that happens to CEOs. I know a lot of you are CEOs, so you get this. The thing that makes you good is some combination of competence and confidence. The difficulty with boards and VCs is they\u2019re really good at identifying what you </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">can\u2019t</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> do: \u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, you can\u2019t do marketing, you don\u2019t really know finance, or whatever.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The problem with that is if you can\u2019t do it, just hearing that you can\u2019t do it just messes up your confidence and your flow. And so that\u2019s not always that helpful.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The phrase I always keep in mind when I\u2019m working with somebody like that is, \u201ccoach them on what they </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">can</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> do,\u201d which is from Al Davis, the old Raiders owner. That\u2019s really the case with CEOs. Todd got himself into trouble, if you recall, because they had the wrong go-to-market. Okta had this bottom-up go-to-market. But at the time, for a security product, it was only actually interesting to larger companies because little companies don\u2019t care that much about security and have nothing to lose. The other thing is that it only worked if everybody was on Okta, so they had to sell the whole company at once. They needed a different sales motion, and he just didn\u2019t know anything about go-to-market. He had been a VP of engineering at Salesforce. I just said, \u00e2\u0080\u009clook, Todd, let me help you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d To Todd\u2019s credit, he said, okay. It was just like, \u00e2\u0080\u009cTodd, you\u2019re great at running the company. You\u2019re great on the leadership side. You just don\u2019t know how to do this, so let me just help you do that. Once he got that, then he got his confidence together and then he just got better at everything.</span></p>\n<span class=\"bctt-click-to-tweet\"><span class=\"bctt-ctt-text\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https://a16z.com/2022/08/19/ben-horowitz-on-how-the-best-leaders-build-culture/&amp;text=The%20phrase%20I%20always%20keep%20in%20mind%20when%20I%27m%20working%20with%20somebody%20like%20that%20is%2C%20%27coach%20them%20on%20what%20they%20can%20do.%27&amp;via=a16z&amp;related=a16z\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">The phrase I always keep in mind when I'm working with somebody like that is, 'coach them on what they can do.' </a></span><a class=\"bctt-ctt-btn\" href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https://a16z.com/2022/08/19/ben-horowitz-on-how-the-best-leaders-build-culture/&amp;text=The%20phrase%20I%20always%20keep%20in%20mind%20when%20I%27m%20working%20with%20somebody%20like%20that%20is%2C%20%27coach%20them%20on%20what%20they%20can%20do.%27&amp;via=a16z&amp;related=a16z\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Click To Tweet</a></span>\n<p><b>David:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> What do you think about the culture that he and Freddy have built there [at Okta] and any lessons for the CEOs here?</span></p>\n<p><b>Ben:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> The thing that they did culturally that was the most important for them\u00e2\u0080\u0094and this is really important on culture\u00e2\u0080\u0094is the thing that went with the company. Because they were a security company, trust was always such a big thing for them. That was a big component of the culture. You have to be able to trust us, and actually, it almost lost them the company. They were missing every quarter at that time. They had this deal, but the sales guy had promised features, that they weren\u2019t going to have for two years, would be there in a quarter. They had to decide whether to take the order, get the round done, and keep it moving.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">But Todd was like, \u00e2\u0080\u009cno, trust is so important that if there\u2019s a story where I okayed a lie, I\u2019ll never get that out of the company.\u00e2\u0080\u009d They told the truth, and they didn\u2019t get the deal. They whiffed the quarter. We almost didn\u2019t get the round. I think David led the B round with a $7M check. That\u2019s how it was. By your fingernails, they were hanging on.\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">But that cultural thing led to always putting reliability and security ahead of features in their development. They were neck and neck with this company, OneLogin, who was actually turning out features much faster. But one day, OneLogin got breached because they did not have that value, they didn\u2019t have that belief. That was the end of the competition. We never saw \u2019em again. Okta just destroyed them after that. That\u2019s where a cultural thing, if you commit to it and it really goes with the business strategy, can have a huge payoff. That\u2019s probably the best thing that I saw them do.</span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><div data-toc-header=\"Finding the talent you don't have\" id=\"section--4\"></div>Finding the talent you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have</span></h3>\n<p><b>David:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> Changing gears, a topic that both of us care about is what I call diversity, but I\u2019ve listened to you explain that that\u2019s the wrong way to think about it. It\u2019s better to think about it as talent discovery.</span></p>\n<p><b>Ben:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> I think diversity is a misdiagnosed problem because it\u2019s diagnosed as racism and sexism, and that\u2019s why things aren\u2019t diverse, and that\u2019s not really what\u2019s going on. On diversity, for the most part, what\u2019s going on is profiling. How do you hire somebody? Well, I know what I\u2019m good at, I value it highly, and I can test for it in an interview, so I\u2019m going to hire me. That\u2019s generally how it works. If you look at any organization, if you\u2019ve got a group that\u2019s run by a Chinese person, there\u2019ll be a lot of Chinese people there. If you have a group run by a woman, there\u2019ll be a lot of women there. That\u2019s the way it goes. You can look at almost any organization, and it works out this way.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">It gets very dangerous if you try and not see the talent and just see the gender, color. Let me give you a great story on that. Steve Stoute, who spoke here a few years ago, called me up one day, and he says, \u201cBen, I used to be president of Sony, Urban Music.\u201d I, of course, already knew that \u2019cause I\u2019d known him for years, but he was setting me up for a story. I said, \u201cyes, Steve, I know that.\u201d He said, \u201cyeah, but it wasn\u2019t urban music. It was black music, but they made me call it \u2018urban music\u2019 because calling it \u2018black music\u2019 would\u2019ve been racist.\u201d I said, \u201cthat\u2019s silly.\u201d He said \u201cno, that wasn\u2019t the dumb part. The dumb part was, because we called it \u2018urban music,\u2019 I wasn\u2019t allowed to market in rural areas\u00e2\u0080\u0094like all black people lived in the city.\u201d I was like, \u201cwow, that\u2019s crazy.\u201d He said, \u201cyou\u2019re not even listening to me, Ben. I was president of Sony, Urban Music. I had Michael Jackson. What white people don\u2019t like Michael Jackson?\u201d It wasn\u2019t black music. It was music. Then if you fast forward from that era of the Urban Music department and the black section and Tower Records to today: go look on Spotify. Look at the top 100. More than 70% of the business is black music.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">It wasn\u2019t black music. It wasn\u2019t a niche. It was just music. And just because some executives had a diversity program to help them, they niched it into this tiny market that was much smaller than what its actual reach was. That\u2019s what we end up doing, with\u00e2\u0080\u0094I call it \u201curban HR\u201d\u00e2\u0080\u0094where you have a diversity department run by somebody who\u2019s completely disconnected from the culture that you want for the rest of the company. They\u2019re putting people through a side door instead of through the front door, \u2019cause you can\u2019t see the talent. You\u2019ve got to develop the ability to see talent that you don\u2019t have.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">I don\u2019t care about how many kinds of people we have. All I care about is attrition, job satisfaction, promotion rates. Can I tell what race or gender you are? And if I can\u2019t, then I\u2019m good. Because that\u2019s what matters. If you\u2019re a great place to work for people of all different talents and backgrounds and cultures, then you\u2019re going to be attractive to that. You have to understand that talent base to be that. And you have to be able to evaluate it. In my view, you have to put in the work, you have to understand talent that you don\u2019t have, you have to network to people that you don\u2019t know. And if you just try and shortcut it by hiring X number of this gender and this race and this orientation, then you\u2019re going to ruin your culture and your environment, because everybody\u2019s going to question everybody. You can\u2019t unsee the hiring process.</span></p>\n<span class=\"bctt-click-to-tweet\"><span class=\"bctt-ctt-text\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https://a16z.com/2022/08/19/ben-horowitz-on-how-the-best-leaders-build-culture/&amp;text=You%20have%20to%20put%20in%20the%20work%2C%20you%20have%20to%20understand%20talent%20that%20you%20don%27t%20have%2C%20you%20have%20to%20network%20to%20people%20that%20you%20don%27t%20know.&amp;via=a16z&amp;related=a16z\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">You have to put in the work, you have to understand talent that you don't have, you have to network to people that you don't know. </a></span><a class=\"bctt-ctt-btn\" href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https://a16z.com/2022/08/19/ben-horowitz-on-how-the-best-leaders-build-culture/&amp;text=You%20have%20to%20put%20in%20the%20work%2C%20you%20have%20to%20understand%20talent%20that%20you%20don%27t%20have%2C%20you%20have%20to%20network%20to%20people%20that%20you%20don%27t%20know.&amp;via=a16z&amp;related=a16z\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Click To Tweet</a></span>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><div data-toc-header=\"Building a resilient company culture\" id=\"section--5\"></div>Building a resilient company culture</span></h3>\n<p><b>David:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> Last two questions. How do you make trade offs when you can\u2019t optimize for everything? You and I were talking about how we remember hundreds of years ago, when we were at Netscape, we had a star engineer who was critical and was quitting because he\u2019d gotten a higher offer somewhere else. I came to you, and I said, \u201cwe need to retain this person.\u201d It wasn\u2019t that big of a deal to match the offer. We could afford it. You said, \u201cno, we\u2019re not doing that.\u201d Because if we do that with this guy, then we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got to do that with everybody else. But how do people know when to match offers? Sometimes, there is a short-term emergency where, if you don\u2019t do it, you\u2019re dead.\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">How do you decide whether to optimize for the long term or the near term? How do you think about that?</span></p>\n<p><b>Ben:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> I think that one thing that people care about a lot in a company and in life is fairness. Is there some set of rules at work that if I do my job, if I make my contribution and so forth, I\u2019m going to be treated fairly? That\u2019s a big thing. By the way, it\u2019s also a big thing on diversity. Are you just going to promote your buddies, your clique, your people like you, or do I have a real chance here? It\u2019s such an important underpinning of everything you want to do culturally, job satisfaction-wise, and so on.\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">My management philosophy at that time and the way we were doing things is: we evaluate everybody on a frequent basis together, and then whoever is performing the best gets the raise. Not the person who quits and gets another job offer, not the person who asks for it, and so forth. That was the principle. For me, that was more important than any individual at that time.\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Reed Hastings has a whole other philosophy, which is you have to get another offer in order to get a raise at Netflix, or at least that\u2019s what he indicates in his book. There are different ways to go about it, but I think that it has to be transparent, fair, and principled. If we had given him the raise there, it would\u2019ve been anything but that. Because the whole thing that we had agreed upon was that we had this process, so anybody who followed the process got screwed. To me, that was never going to happen. I never want to penalize people for not asking for a raise, for not going to get another job, and so forth. I\u2019d much rather give people a reward for being loyal and honest and doing what we asked him to do than this other shadow way of doing things.</span></p>\n<p><b>David:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> Okay, last question.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">When OpsWare was acquired by HP, you made a comment about what it was like to work at HP. It was like nobody cared. It wasn\u2019t their company. One thing that clearly helps the company succeed is having the whole company be resilient and having ownership and having the whole company be courageous.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">So, for a closing thought: what advice would you give to CEOs to set a resilient culture?</span></p>\n<p><b>Ben:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> At this point, and most of you are probably at this stage in your company, it feels like for everybody who works there, they\u2019d only work there if they felt like it was their company. It\u2019s a startup. We\u2019re all in this together. This is my company. Whatever I contribute is going to matter because this is something that I built. That feeling, the longer you can preserve it at the higher the scale, the better your company\u2019s going to be, just in very rough terms. At Hewlett Packard at the end, nobody felt like it was their company. They were on their fourth professional CEO and everybody was there for a paycheck. And the difference in the quality of the company, the ability to do new things, everything really relies on that. Am I working there, or is it my company? One of the amazing things about Amazon\u00e2\u0080\u0094that you see almost throughout Jeff\u2019s tenure\u00e2\u0080\u0094is that he was able to maintain that idea that people at Amazon really felt like Amazon was theirs at a giant scale. You lose it. It\u2019s never as good as in the very beginning. You lose it over time, but the slower you lose it, the better off you are. When you think about culture and management and all these kinds of things, it\u2019s really important to keep that in mind. If I do this, will everybody feel like it\u2019s their company?</span></p>\n<p><b>David:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> Thank you very much, Ben.</span></p>\n<p><b>Ben:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> Thank you.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\">***</p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The above transcript is abridged and edited for clarity.</span></i></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The views expressed here are those of the individual AH Capital Management, L.L.C.

Over the last decade, generations of digital health companies have struggled to reach escape velocity\u00e2\u0080\u0094not because their products and services weren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t transformative, but because they failed to find an executable path for sustainable distribution and value capture.</p>\n<p>Some of that was simply due to the overall immaturity of the market and its inability (or resistance) to absorb and pay for novel, software-based products that didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t slot easily into existing budgets and care plans. Some of it was that companies lacked the capital to be able to survive long healthcare enterprise sales cycles that were the primary path for going to market.</p>\n<p>In response, resourceful digital health founders have been finding <a href=\"https://a16z.com/2021/10/19/the-new-go-to-market-playbooks-for-digital-health-startups/\">creative and efficient ways of getting their technology to market</a>. We believe this is important for our healthcare system. So, we have been collecting insights and knowledge from these founders in our <a href=\"https://a16z.com/digital-health-builders/\">Digital Health Go-To-Market Playbook</a> series, in hope that our learnings will help you build your companies.</p>\n<p>One exciting go-to-market strategy we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve observed is to build a two-sided network. In this approach, a company builds products and services that are valuable to one market constituent\u00e2\u0080\u0094say, patients, providers, payors, pharma/biotech, or pharmacies\u00e2\u0080\u0094and then leverages that network of users, as well as the data generated in serving those users, into offering products and services to another set of constituents. Though this strategy comes with added complexity, two-sided networks can result in more durable business models as a result of powerful <a href=\"https://a16z.com/tag/all-about-network-effects/\">network effects</a>.</p>\n<p>In this episode of our Digital Health Go-to-Market Playbook, we talk about the basics behind a two-sided network model and why it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a particularly interesting time in healthcare for this approach.

At the end of the day, a network is a group of interconnected transacting parties\u00e2\u0080\u0094that could be businesses that could be people, companies, patients, and providers.</p>\n<p>Today, when we think of really well-connected, integrated networks, healthcare isn\u2019t usually the first industry that comes to mind. We think of healthcare instead as this unfortunately fragmented, siloed world where data is stuck in one part of the industry and can\u2019t flow freely to other parts.</p>\n<p>Now there are nuances and gray areas, but the five major constituents of the healthcare industry are what we like to sometimes call the 5 Ps.</p>\n<p>There are the pharma companies, also known to a broader extent as life sciences companies. They build the products\u00e2\u0080\u0094that could be drugs, diagnostic tests.</p>\n<p>There are pharmacies\u00e2\u0080\u0094that\u2019s the supply chain, people and companies who are ultimately selling those products to end users.</p>\n<p>There are providers\u00e2\u0080\u0094those are the doctors, nurses, health systems, hospitals, the infrastructure by which we actually do care delivery, which leverages those life sciences products to help patients.</p>\n<p>And there are payors:, the group that pays for healthcare services. That could include insurance companies, that could include Medicare, that could include self-insured employers.</p>\n<p>And finally, there are patients\u00e2\u0080\u0094the people that all of these entities collectively try to serve as the healthcare ecosystem.</p>\n<p>And oftentimes these 5 Ps struggle to connect or to transact really seamlessly with each other. And that\u2019s exactly the problem, actually, that two-sided network businesses in healthcare are often tackling. They\u2019re building those channels, those connections, between major players in the healthcare industry, and often data reinforces those connections.</p>\n<h3><div data-toc-header=\"What makes a two-sided network work?\" id=\"section--2\"></div>What makes a two-sided network work?</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/What-makes-a-two-sided-network-actually-work_-2.jpg?ssl=1\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-314104 size-full\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"1080\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/What-makes-a-two-sided-network-actually-work_-2.jpg?resize=1920%2C1080&amp;ssl=1\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/What-makes-a-two-sided-network-actually-work_-2.jpg?w=1920&amp;ssl=1 1920w, https://i0.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/What-makes-a-two-sided-network-actually-work_-2.jpg?resize=300%2C169&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/What-makes-a-two-sided-network-actually-work_-2.jpg?resize=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/What-makes-a-two-sided-network-actually-work_-2.jpg?resize=768%2C432&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/What-makes-a-two-sided-network-actually-work_-2.jpg?resize=1536%2C864&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/What-makes-a-two-sided-network-actually-work_-2.jpg?resize=1120%2C630&amp;ssl=1 1120w, https://i0.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/What-makes-a-two-sided-network-actually-work_-2.jpg?resize=125%2C70&amp;ssl=1 125w, https://i0.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/What-makes-a-two-sided-network-actually-work_-2.jpg?resize=740%2C416&amp;ssl=1 740w, https://i0.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/What-makes-a-two-sided-network-actually-work_-2.jpg?resize=587%2C330&amp;ssl=1 587w\" width=\"1920\"/></a></p>\n<p><strong>Jay:</strong> Now let\u2019s take a minute to discuss what makes a two-sided network actually work and how it\u2019s different from a company with two distinct business units.</p>\n<p>The two are similar in that both execute one distinct, go-to-market motion for each customer set. But here\u2019s what makes a two-sided network different. The company is building a product that is valuable to one set of customers and the delivery of that product to those customers allows them to do something else for an entirely different set of customers.</p>\n<p>And when one company successfully executes two independent, go-to-market motions in parallel, a powerful network effect kicks in and each go-to-market motion becomes easier because the other exists. In short, one plus one is greater than two, and the business becomes greater than the sum of its parts.</p>\n<p><strong>Vineeta:</strong> So let\u2019s look at some examples of two-sided networks to build a little bit of intuition on what this go-to-market motion means and what it can enable.</p>\n<p>So a canonical network business we all know is Google. Google is a business that indirectly connects consumers, the first side of their business, with a vast universe of advertisers on the other side. On the consumer side, we all know that they\u2019ve built a suite of products and services that meet our needs as consumers, from search engines, to email tools, to business tools. And then separately for advertisers, they\u2019ve also built a suite of products, services, and analytics that underpin their advertising business, and that take advantage of all the knowledge that comes from the consumer side of their business. And the key is that these two business arms depend intrinsically on one another. The advertising business only works if it can leverage the deep reach into the consumer world that Google has, and the consumer business can\u2019t live or sustain itself without the funding that comes from the advertising business.</p>\n<p>And so both sides of this network become self-reinforcing parts of the overall Google business because of the data, really, that flows through the channel that Google has created by indirectly connecting these two different go-to-market motions.</p>\n<p><strong>Jay:</strong> So that was a consumer internet example. Let\u2019s talk about a healthcare example that Vineeta and I both experienced through our time at Flatiron Health. Nat Turner, Zach Weinberg, the founders of Flatiron, and the incredible team there built a groundbreaking two-sided network business to organize the world\u2019s cancer data.</p>\n<p>The basis for Flatiron was the observation that there\u2019s a lot of data generated every single day by oncology care providers, from patient symptoms, whether and how they respond to drugs, even the genomic profile of tumors. Pharmaceutical companies really want to learn from this exact kind of data to make oncology drug discovery, development, and distribution better and more efficient.</p>\n<p>So Flatiron Health built a two-sided network that connected these stakeholders\u00e2\u0080\u0094healthcare providers on one side of the business and pharmaceutical companies on the other\u00e2\u0080\u0094by first building a suite of deeply integrated software products to help providers take care of their patients.</p>\n<p>At the same time, they created tools to clean and analyze that data and turn it into a format and structure that\u2019s useful for drug development. Much like in the Google example, the two sides of the business aren\u2019t directly transacting with one another, but the data streams from each side reinforce one another.</p>\n<h3><div data-toc-header=\"Why now in healthcare?\" id=\"section--3\"></div>Why now in healthcare?</h3>\n<p><strong>Vineeta:</strong> So why are we seeing the rise of a two-sided network go-to-market strategy? We think there are at least three tailwinds playing out over the last several years, which are accelerating this trend and making it durable.</p>\n<p>First there\u2019s more healthcare data in a digital format than there ever was before. Almost 95% of care providers have adopted electronic health records in the last decade, since the HITECH Act in 2009. Over 35% of all the world\u2019s data is actually generated in the process of delivering healthcare.</p>\n<p>We have all this data now about patients and health records, their diagnostic tests, patient-reported outcomes, claims, and much more. The health industry leaves a very rich data trail. And so all this data now exists and is digitized. That\u2019s the first trend.</p>\n<p>The second is that this data is actually more commonly stored in the cloud. Despite privacy concerns about healthcare data, many, many providers, hospitals, clinics, labs, EHR vendors\u00e2\u0080\u0094all that data is actually living in Google Cloud or on AWS, rather than on an on-prem server in the basement of your hospital. And that means that that data is more accessible and easier to share, to analyze, across the entire industry.</p>\n<p>And the final trend that we think is important is that our tools and capabilities to process, transform, and analyze this data has also improved.</p>\n<p>Our partners have written about this and emerging architectures for the modern data infrastructure stack\u00e2\u0080\u0094and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an <a href=\"https://future.com/emerging-architectures-modern-data-infrastructure/\">interesting read</a>, we\u2019d encourage you to check it out. But the industry for those tools was not just focused on a particular application. It\u2019s universally enabling, and healthcare data is no exception.</p>\n<p>So not only do we have a lot more data, we also have incredible tools that allow us to learn from that data more rapidly. And so this really is a perfect environment for entrepreneurs to ask: How do I exploit that possibility that I can use data to build connectivity between otherwise siloed parts of the industry?</p>\n<p>And two-sided networks look pretty interesting in that light.</p>\n<h3><div data-toc-header=\"When should a startup try a two-sided network play?\" id=\"section--4\"></div>When should a startup try a two-sided network play?</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/When-should-a-startup-try-a-two-sided-network-play_-26.jpg?ssl=1\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-314112\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"1080\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/When-should-a-startup-try-a-two-sided-network-play_-26.jpg?resize=1920%2C1080&amp;ssl=1\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/When-should-a-startup-try-a-two-sided-network-play_-26.jpg?w=1920&amp;ssl=1 1920w, https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/When-should-a-startup-try-a-two-sided-network-play_-26.jpg?resize=300%2C169&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/When-should-a-startup-try-a-two-sided-network-play_-26.jpg?resize=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/When-should-a-startup-try-a-two-sided-network-play_-26.jpg?resize=768%2C432&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/When-should-a-startup-try-a-two-sided-network-play_-26.jpg?resize=1536%2C864&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/When-should-a-startup-try-a-two-sided-network-play_-26.jpg?resize=1120%2C630&amp;ssl=1 1120w, https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/When-should-a-startup-try-a-two-sided-network-play_-26.jpg?resize=125%2C70&amp;ssl=1 125w, https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/When-should-a-startup-try-a-two-sided-network-play_-26.jpg?resize=740%2C416&amp;ssl=1 740w, https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/When-should-a-startup-try-a-two-sided-network-play_-26.jpg?resize=587%2C330&amp;ssl=1 587w\" width=\"1920\"/></a></p>\n<p><strong>Jay:</strong> While two-sided networks can be more complex to execute, founders who choose this go-to-market strategy are typically addressing at least one of three situations in which it can be worth the effort.</p>\n<p>One: Broken data flows between two sets of constituents. In this scenario, one party is interested in insights from another party, but this data isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t flowing frequently between them, typically because there aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t software rails in-between them. Or alternatively, one party wants to collaborate with the other and needs an efficient channel for engagement. The startup becomes that connecting bridge.</p>\n<p>Two: Severe fragmentation in a market that makes it difficult for users to access, navigate or transact with the other side. The interface in this is the marketplace, which aggregates that fragmented ecosystem and makes it more accessible to other parties.</p>\n<p>Three: Highly elastic demand whereby you have consumers who really need and are willing to use a certain product or service, but where monetizing directly either isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t feasible or would slow down adoption or damage retention prohibitively. So finding a sustainable business model elsewhere can make a lot of sense.</p>\n<p>There is no perfect, right way to build a two-sided business in healthcare and life sciences. It\u2019s still very much a growing, evolving strategy. We\u2019re fortunate to have spoken with so many founders choosing this approach and we\u2019ll share some of our learnings as well as interview clips from five exceptional founders in particular about how they approach building their businesses and hope that our learnings help you build your companies.</p>\n<h3><div data-toc-header=\"The 8 questions we asked founders\" id=\"section--5\"></div>The 8 questions we asked founders</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Transition-Questions-ALL.jpg?ssl=1\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-314108\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"1080\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Transition-Questions-ALL.jpg?resize=1920%2C1080&amp;ssl=1\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Transition-Questions-ALL.jpg?w=1920&amp;ssl=1 1920w, https://i2.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Transition-Questions-ALL.jpg?resize=300%2C169&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Transition-Questions-ALL.jpg?resize=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Transition-Questions-ALL.jpg?resize=768%2C432&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Transition-Questions-ALL.jpg?resize=1536%2C864&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i2.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Transition-Questions-ALL.jpg?resize=1120%2C630&amp;ssl=1 1120w, https://i2.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Transition-Questions-ALL.jpg?resize=125%2C70&amp;ssl=1 125w, https://i2.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Transition-Questions-ALL.jpg?resize=740%2C416&amp;ssl=1 740w, https://i2.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Transition-Questions-ALL.jpg?resize=587%2C330&amp;ssl=1 587w\" width=\"1920\"/></a></p>\n<h4><div data-toc-header=\"1. Which side did you start with?\" id=\"section--6\"></div>1. Which side did you start with?</h4>\n<p>When you\u2019re building a business with a two-sided network strategy, it\u2019s often not obvious which side of the business to start with first. We heard from Arif Nathoo, CEO and Cofounder of Komodo Health, which is overcoming broken data flows with a two-sided network connecting life sciences companies on the first side, and providers, payors, and pharmacies on the second side. He described how they started with the demand side, targeting a very narrow set of users, but delighting them relative to their very best next alternative.</p>\n<p><strong>Arif:</strong> I think every tech company should start with the demand side.</p>\n<p>So we actually picked a very specific audience within life sciences, which were these folks on medical affairs teams. Medical affairs teams are responsible for non-promotional scientific exchange, which basically means having scientific conversations with doctors.</p>\n<p>We saw their needs were really gated by a lack of visibility into a provider\u2019s overall practice. So you can get lots of information on what doctors are publishing, you can see what clinical trials they\u2019re running, but what you lack is really deep insight as to where they are in the care journey of a patient.</p>\n<p>And we thought, hey, if we could bring really, really good insight to that, we could serve this one little niche really well. And so that\u2019s how we started the business. We served one population. And through that we built one application and that application, we sold to that one buyer type and the business really grew from there\u00e2\u0080\u0094but it all started out because we really wanted to get one thing right.</p>\n<p><strong>Jay:</strong> Alternatively, we heard from Andrew Adams, CEO and Cofounder at Headway, which is overcoming fragmentation with the multi-sided network that connects patients with mental healthcare providers and insurers. He described how they focused on the supply side first\u00e2\u0080\u0094in their case, mental healthcare providers\u00e2\u0080\u0094because of their insight that their market was fundamentally supply constrained.</p>\n<p><strong>Andrew:</strong> This was particularly core during the early couple of years of Headway, that we very clearly had a patient-oriented mission. We\u2019re building a new mental healthcare system that everyone can access.</p>\n<p>But then our means of delivery and our strategic focus was very particularly on the therapist, which is the scarcest entity in the space. It\u2019s the scarcest asset in the space, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s really hard for payors to work with fragmented providers in which they feel like there\u2019s not enough of them, and it\u2019s really hard for the patient to find a provider.</p>\n<p>So we had a very crystal clear clarity, particularly early on. And again, I\u2019m disclaiming early on because once you do this, you have an opportunity to evolve and do more. But very early on, we had the unambiguous clarity of the therapist being our customer.</p>\n<p>We framed our demand generation as an activation rate for our supply side. So we very, very rigorously filtered things through that lens of building for the provider. And if you look in terms of technically what we delivered, we did all sorts of things that no patient would ever raise their hand say, I want that. No patient has ever been like, you know what? I\u2019d love a way to find a provider online, but first and foremost, I gotta vet how good their claims engine is, or I want to see how good their credentialing engine is. But that stuff is really important to be able to scalably build for the provider to have something that money just appears, credentialing just happens.</p>\n<p>And so we built the best claims engine. We built the best credentialing engine. We built the best benefit interpretation engine in the country, regardless of specialty, because we built it from tech, from the get-go, focused on our vertical mental health. And so we did all these things that were focused on getting active providers. Ultimately to serve our patient mission involved focusing rigorously on the supply side.</p>\n<p><strong>Jay:</strong> And to make things more complex, we hear some go after both sides in parallel. We heard from Iman Abuzeid, CEO and Cofounder of Incredible Health, which is addressing fragmentation between healthcare workers, specifically nurse practitioners and employers. She described how they were able to go after both sides right away by applying a focus constraint on geography for an initial period before scaling.</p>\n<p><strong>Iman:</strong> Yeah, so we started with both. We went after supply and demand at the same time, but we stayed geographically very focused, like many other two-sided marketplaces. When we started, we were only live in the San Francisco Bay Area.</p>\n<p>And so when you restrict your market like that, it becomes a lot more manageable to get supply and demand, and you can really figure out your playbooks for how you\u2019re going to get supply and demand.</p>\n<p><strong>Jay:</strong> So our first key takeaway is that whether you start on the demand side, the supply side, or a limited version of both, it\u2019s best to focus on the most constrained aspect of the market to jumpstart the network.</p>\n<p>And regardless of who you start with, trust needs to be the foundation. We talked to Thomas Clozel, CEO and Cofounder of Owkin, which is building research infrastructure for both care providers on the first side and biopharma companies on the second side. He emphasized the importance of building trust with their first users\u00e2\u0080\u0094in their case, hospitals.</p>\n<p><strong>Thomas:</strong> We first really built this trust by saying, this is cool, you see medicine, you don\u2019t see product, you don\u2019t see data, you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t see cash. And it really felt important because we were working with physicians, you know? So I think that the trust was really the first layer that keeps all these hospitals working with us year after year after year.</p>\n<p><strong>Jay:</strong> And GoodRx took a very similar approach of addressing fragmentation between individual consumers on one side and manufacturers and pharmacies on the other. CEO and Cofounder Doug Hirsch shared with us how they built trust with their patient users early on to drive adoption and grow the business.</p>\n<p><strong>Doug:</strong> It\u2019s really, really hard to change people\u2019s behavior.</p>\n<p>And they\u2019re looking for a reason, I don\u2019t trust this new thing or they\u2019re up to no good or who knows what. And so we wanted to just\u00e2\u0080\u0094I mean, if you look at GoodRx, the core of GoodRx back in 2012, it was a search box, a price page, and a coupon. And we took great effort to make sure that it was just as easy as possible for someone to get in, the prices that we showed were accurate, it worked when you showed up at the pharmacy.</p>\n<p>We put a tremendous amount of effort into, we call it patient advocacy here, but that\u2019s really customer care to others. We have sort of that Zappos model of, just call us for anything. We\u2019ll do our best to solve it for you and do it right.</p>\n<p><strong>Jay:</strong> So these two stories illustrate our second key takeaway\u00e2\u0080\u0094that trust is essential for building the first side with the strong foundation to enable future sides of the business.</p>\n<h4><div data-toc-header=\"2. How did you convince early users to try your product?\" id=\"section--7\"></div>2. How did you convince early users to try your product?</h4>\n<p>So once you\u2019ve identified your initial users, how do you go about engaging them? We consistently heard an emphasis on identifying single-user utility before highlighting the future network. Doug at GoodRx shared with us how they started with an ultra-simple product and limited the friction of using GoodRx.</p>\n<p><strong>Doug:</strong> I\u2019m the guy who\u2019s used to just building incredible products without any marketing budget. And if the product is great, people will come and if it\u2019s not, they won\u2019t. And I kind of believe that to this day. We have a very significant marketing department, we spend hundreds of millions of dollars in marketing, but I still ultimately believe that you should be driving a significant amount of your traffic organically because you should be providing a product that provides enough value that people are gonna tell their friends about it.</p>\n<p>V1 of GoodRx, which we launched at Health 2.0 in San Francisco, back in 2010/2011, was kind of a fake website to be honest, right? I think Costco published prices on their website, apparently in New York state you can demand a price list\u00e2\u0080\u0094although I challenge you to do that because any pharmacist will look at you like you\u2019re crazy when you do that. We just cobbled, we had people calling places, we asked our friends what price they were paying for certain meds, we just cobbled something together, threw it up there. And then we presented at this conference and there was a voting mechanism at this conference and we came in second place to a much more well-known brand at the time.</p>\n<p>I think we also made the decision early on to not require registration, which, you know, one of the biggest downsides of most of the health products that are out there, especially like your own insurance company is it requires such onerous identification and setup in order for someone to use the product that people just don\u2019t bother.</p>\n<p>And especially when we\u2019re asking someone to take a flyer on something so important. This is about your care and prescriptions, something so personal. And we thought okay, let\u2019s help you start a search. We then help you spell the name of that drug. And we will immediately take you to prices at pharmacies you recognize. We\u2019re not going to ask you to sign up. We\u2019re not going to ask you to authenticate yourself and do all these crazy things. I\u2019m not gonna ask you to pay even, obviously.</p>\n<p><strong>Jay:</strong> Similarly, Iman at Incredible Health shared with us the manual matching they did through their personal networks for the first cohort of users in absence of not having the other side of the network fully built.</p>\n<p><strong>Iman:</strong> We spent some time understanding their problems and we discovered that nurses and other healthcare workers have a terrible job search experience. They apply to 10, 15 places. They don\u2019t even hear back\u00e2\u0080\u0094they describe it as a black hole. And even when they do hear back, it can still take months. And so when we described the main value proposition, like hey, the employers are going to apply to you instead of you applying to them, that was a very appealing value prop to them.</p>\n<p>I think the first 30 or 40 nurses, we just recruited through our networks, frankly. There was no software, to your point. And just really used that value proposition of, hey, employers are going to apply to you instead of you applying to them as the main message and that got the first 50 to 100 nurses on our platform.</p>\n<p><strong>Jay:</strong> In a slightly different approach, Thomas at Owkin shared with us how they built trust with their early users by offering subsidized professional services in the form of custom analytic projects and co-publishing the results with their customers and academic journals all before getting to monetization.</p>\n<p><strong>Thomas:</strong> With this value proposition about we\u2019re going to work with the hospitals, we came to them, saying, we\u2019re not going to take your data. We don\u2019t want to take your data out. We want to help you curate these data sets. We want to help make big, breakthrough discoveries with our data science team and we have an excellent one. And we want to publish with you. We want to write stuff. We started like that, like let\u2019s work together. Let\u2019s try to find things that had not been discovered before. And then we started to make projects. Start with one center. Curie was the first in France. Then we got a few others coming in.</p>\n<p>And we came with this idea and we started to publish, make projects, discover where our technology was the most efficient and start to try to federate the centers together as well and build these federated learning products.</p>\n<p><strong>Jay:</strong> So this brings us to our third key takeaway, which is that every founder emphasized starting with the narrow gaze of solving a single core problem for your initial users.</p>\n<h4><div data-toc-header=\"3. How did you price your initial product?\" id=\"section--8\"></div>3. How did you price your initial product?</h4>\n<p>Practically, no founder we speak with feels like they optimize pricing, especially in the early days on the first side of their business. One common theme we heard though, was that on the first side, the goal is to optimize for customer feedback and engagement rather than solely on near-term economics.</p>\n<p>As one example, Owkin focused on building trust with their provider customers and set their pricing model accordingly. They didn\u2019t want hospitals to pay for their software. And so they developed a revenue sharing model accordingly.</p>\n<p><strong>Thomas:</strong> Then came our third value. We don\u2019t want to have providers. We don\u2019t want to have hospitals pay. What we want to do is enrich the academic system we\u2019re coming from and we want to help it, we want to make it grow.</p>\n<p>So we knew that, and knowing that, we knew that we will never try to make hospitals pay. It\u2019s not a great business anyway, to try to make hospitals pay. Some others do it really well, but we didn\u2019t want to do it and it didn\u2019t feel right. And so we came to the things that we need to find a win-win model with them. And the win-win model was we were going to give you this technology, our platform, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to help you on the data science side, we going to have to curate that up, we also even generate that as a single cell data, special transcriptomic, really high-quality datasets that they don\u2019t have. And we\u2019ll revenue share with you, up to 10% usually. So that\u2019s kind of the new thing. And the model was a really win-win model.</p>\n<p><strong>Jay:</strong> This story echoes what we\u2019ve heard from many founders as well, that it\u2019s key to price for engagement and learning to inform future product development on both sides.</p>\n<h4><div data-toc-header=\"4. What metrics did you focus on?\" id=\"section--9\"></div>4. What metrics did you focus on?</h4>\n<p><strong>Jay:</strong> Ultimately, there\u2019s so much nuance in each market, such that your go-to-market journey is going to vary case by case, but we asked founders what metrics they looked at to gauge whether they were on the right track forward. For Arif at Komodo, they anchored to a particular qualitative metric, which they called moments of truth, above all the traditional quantitative enterprise SaaS metrics that they of course looked at as well.</p>\n<p><strong>Arif:</strong> Well, if I\u2019m basing my pricing to value, I need to base my product metrics to value. That\u2019s really hard for product because I can\u2019t look at a session and say, \u201care they getting value from that session?\u201d if all I\u2019m looking at is how they\u2019re clicking through or the amount of time they\u2019re spending in the app.</p>\n<p>And so what we focused on instead for our product team were \u00e2\u0080\u009cmoments of truth.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The customer needs something. How am I driving that value better, faster, and more efficiently than anyone else? And so those moments of truth are actually what we found were highly predictive of outcomes. And so actually our product team invested in running QBRs with every one of our customers, even when we were tiny. And yes, utilization metrics are part of it, but more importantly, the stories around how the customer was driving value in their business from our product became the actual primary way for them to make those calls. And so they would look at that and say, okay, there were like six moments of truth, and we served all of them. And then we shared that with the customer and the customer got really excited. And then they said, okay, here\u2019s what we\u2019re gonna do next quarter. And so it allowed them to start to build their relationship in a deeper way with us.</p>\n<p>And we measure ourselves on that revenue retention, dollar revenue retention, whatever sort of retention metric, which factors in essentially your gross churn combined with your upsell. And so every one of these QBRs is not just an opportunity to get a renewal. It\u2019s an opportunity to get an expansion, expand to another team, expand to another product that may suit some of the product needs that the team has. So we don\u2019t think of these as just, get the renewal. We think of it as what is the relationship that allows us to grow our presence with that team across the entire Komodo suite of products.</p>\n<p><strong>Jay:</strong> Andrew described how Headway focused on one north star quantitative metric, but then changed the north star metric as the company matured through different stages.</p>\n<p><strong>Andrew:</strong> Early on in our company\u2019s development, we prioritized how many active providers we had, which is active supply side users. We really, really privileged that. And indeed, much like the development of marketplaces, once you really corner supply\u00e2\u0080\u0094and we built the best supply acquisition engine, we are bigger, faster than any would-be competitor\u00e2\u0080\u0094then we really knew as well for some other strategic inputs that it was a time to think about not just cornering and having a north star metric be supply units, but a derivative of GMV, which for us was appointment, supply, and demand intersecting.</p>\n<p><strong>Jay:</strong> So our fifth takeaway is to find your north star metric, whether it\u2019s qualitative or quantitative, and then be willing to adjust that metric as your company evolves.</p>\n<p>We heard many examples of metrics being misleading without context. So the key is to diligently pick the ones that actually drive business value for your network. For GoodRx, which would look at aggregate traffic and page rank among other things, external changes could really skew those.</p>\n<p><strong>Doug:</strong> We looked at our page rank because we are obviously primarily an organic based company. No one really occupied drug name plus price, and so we wanted to make sure that we were filling that void and that we could actually make some headway by just answering that question again for both consumers and physicians. And so I think, you know, obviously we looked at aggregate traffic, we looked at page rank, we looked at claims.</p>\n<p>So let\u2019s say Google suddenly decided that we were the best option for lisinopril. Lisinopril is just a drug. But let\u2019s say lisinopril is the head term, right, not lisinopril plus price. And so all of a sudden our lisinopril traffic would go through the roof, but of course, so would our bounce rate, because people would come and they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re actually looking for side effects of lisinopril, or they were looking for interactions with lisinopril, or should I take it if I\u2019m pregnant or who knows what. And so those could be sometimes confusing. They also of course blow out your metrics because now you\u2019re the head term and you\u2019re the number one search result and all of a sudden it skews things. So you have to be careful because, remember I came from the world of social, I was at Facebook, where time spent was the god metric, like we care about as many eyeballs and as much time as we can. At GoodRx it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s less about time spent and really more about making sure the consumer gets a positive outcome and they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re able to find a great resolution.</p>\n<p><strong>Iman:</strong> In general, just looking at top of funnel metrics can be very misleading if we\u2019re not looking at the middle and the bottom of the funnel in terms of what the activity you actually want to happen. A vanity metric is just looking at the overall number of talent on the platform, because it doesn\u2019t really matter if there\u2019s a thousand, ten thousand, a million, millions of healthcare workers on the platform if they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not engaged, if they don\u2019t have their profiles completed and if they\u2019re not being put in front of employers.</p>\n<p><strong>Jay:</strong> And so our last takeaway for building the first side of your network is to be mindful of the north star metric you choose, and especially to watch out for those vanity metrics.</p>\n<h4><div data-toc-header=\"5. When should you activate the next side?\" id=\"section--10\"></div>5. When should you activate the next side?</h4>\n<p>So after establishing the first side of the business, founders then have to start thinking about how to turn the data stream from the first side of the business to drive the second side\u2019s growth.</p>\n<p><strong>Arif:</strong> Once you have that core, then the question is: How can you use it to the benefit of the folks who will provide you the next set of insights? And so we actually took that core and we built a lot of insights that helped folks that see patient journeys, like providers, like payors. And by doing that, gave them a reason to both contribute to us and, as well, take something from us.</p>\n<p><strong>Jay:</strong> In fact, it might even be the case that the data stream and engagement that a business has curated is so good that the second side of the business comes to you.</p>\n<p><strong>Doug:</strong> We had a number of manufacturers call us up. I had one very senior manufacturer, C-level executive at a major manufacturer, call us up and say, this system\u2019s just broken. You guys have the eyeballs. We want to get in front of the people so that we can tell them about our drug and give them the tools like patient assistance programs and manufacturer discounts. We want to go direct. We want to just end-run this whole messy system. And so we knew there was an opportunity here when we were getting those kinds of phone calls.</p>\n<h4><div data-toc-header=\"6. How did you find product-market fit (again)?\" id=\"section--11\"></div>6. How did you find product-market fit (again)?</h4>\n<p><strong>Jay:</strong> Now whether you have some inbound demand for the second side of your business or not, you likely still need to do the cycles of customer pain point discovery and product iteration, which you successfully did on the first side of your business, in order to succeed in the second motion. GoodRx was quite disciplined in their approach here.</p>\n<p><strong>Doug:</strong> We just started slowly calling up manufacturers and saying, hey look, we\u2019ve got more people sitting on the GoodRx slash whatever drug name page than you have at whateverdrugname.com. So what do you want to say to those people? And you start with the basic stuff. You start with the same ads that you see on the Golf Channel and stuff like that.</p>\n<p>But then we started thinking about way more sophisticated programs, like we have a program right now where we actually have a nurse, a live 24/7 nurse chat sitting on a drug page. So you can actually talk to a nurse about the drug.</p>\n<p>We have, again, integration of patient assistance programs, so if you just simply can\u2019t afford it, they have these incredible programs that\u2019ll bring down the cost to as much as zero. We have all sorts of integrations that ultimately are focused on connecting that provider who traditionally does not have a great relationship, doesn\u2019t really know the patient, because they\u2019re very divorced from it. They often have a drug that you can\u2019t even pronounce that they can\u2019t necessarily connect with the patient. And we\u2019re the glue, we\u2019re the glue that can be in the middle.</p>\n<p><strong>Jay:</strong> Now it can be daunting and potentially distracting to start again on a new side as the first side of the business is really taking off. But focusing on finding product-market fit in the new segment can drive stickiness for both sides of the network. Incredible Health found that product expansion surfaced more ideas for further product expansion, which surfaced more ideas for product expansion, which continues to fuel their growth today.</p>\n<p><strong>Iman:</strong> So product expansion in a two-sided marketplace is probably one of the most effective things you can do to drive growth and to drive your own, and to drive a company\u2019s defensibility, and to drive delightful user experiences.</p>\n<p>So we\u2019ll talk about it on the talent side and on the employer. So on the talent side, it was very important that we\u2019re not just the place where a nurse and eventually other healthcare workers find a job. We need to do more than that. We need to have, from a product standpoint, we need to have a career-long relationship with them.</p>\n<p>So we do offer free continuing education to every single nurse in the country. We offer free salary estimators for every single nurse in the country. We have an advice platform or community built into our apps where nurses can give each other highly personalized advice. It\u2019s like a Quora for nurses.</p>\n<p>And we continue to add more and more of these services. In addition to that, our customer support team offers interview preparation, helps with resume guides and so on. And so, I think the more value that we drive to the talent, first of all, the more join us and then the more stay with us. It really is a huge driver of user acquisition and engagement on the talent side.</p>\n<p>Now the same is true on the employer side. You know, we incorrectly thought in our early days, if we deliver the talent, we\u2019re good to go. We can just move on. And no, it turns out that we actually have to build quite a lot of B2B workflow software for the employers.</p>\n<p>Automatic interview scheduling, in-app chat between the talent and the employers. We had to build an SMS technology, we had to share a robust set of data analytics so they can benchmark themselves against their competitors who were also using the platform so they can improve their internal hiring operations.</p>\n<p><strong>Jay:</strong> So when it comes to building out the second side of your network, our first takeaway is to repeat the product discovery and iteration process that your organization executed so effectively before in order to find product-market fit again.</p>\n<p>But again, excess complexity can start to creep up. Keeping it simple and familiar can drive adoption and growth tremendously.</p>\n<p><strong>Andrew:</strong> So to payors we get to transact in a way that\u2019s really familiar looking like a doctor\u2019s office. So even though over time, as part of being more than just a provider group we layer on additional pricing complexity and additional product complexity, we looked really familiar. We get paid like a doctor\u2019s office gets paid, which allows us to in turn pay providers like a doctor\u2019s office gets paid. And so for providers, they do not have to see us as some of it entails a SaaS fee. They see patients and then they get paid, there\u2019s not any additional auxiliary fees for what we\u2019re offering.</p>\n<p>We get to give away our software to providers for free. They get a marketplace where patients can find them. They get a SaaS portal where the billing and the scheduling happens in a way where insurance is invisible, and then they get paid a straightforward fee for each session.</p>\n<p><strong>Iman:</strong> The more complexity there is in pricing, the harder it is to close a deal. And right now we\u2019re in hyper-growth mode. Incredible Health grew 400% last year, we\u2019re on track to grow another 300, 400% this year. And our priority right now is to drive market share and expand as much as we can. And so we kept our pricing very simple as a result.</p>\n<p><strong>Jay:</strong> So as you\u2019re iterating, it\u2019s key to look for any area you can to cut out complexity.</p>\n<h4><div data-toc-header=\"7. How did you balance customer priorities across both sides?\" id=\"section--12\"></div>7. How did you balance customer priorities across both sides?</h4>\n<p>Now, once you achieve success on both sides, you encounter the more pronounced challenge of keeping both sides. Iman at Incredible articulated what we heard from many about serving both, but ultimately being clear about the north star of your network and why that alignment ultimately benefits both sides of your network.</p>\n<p><strong>Iman:</strong> This happens all the time. We have employers that have asked for exclusivities, they ask, can we get them talent first? And we always say no to those requests.</p>\n<p>We explain that we operate like Switzerland, we\u2019re neutral, and we don\u2019t have any preference for one employer over the other. And the reason for that is because of the talent at the end of the day\u00e2\u0080\u0094the mission says to help healthcare professionals find and do their best work.</p>\n<p>And at the end of the day, it\u2019s up to the talent where they ultimately want to end up being, and we want to maximize the number of opportunities that the talent has.</p>\n<p><strong>Jay:</strong> And that\u2019s how we get to our third takeaway, which is of course, to work with all sides of the networks, but to be open and clear about your alignment with one in particular.</p>\n<h4><div data-toc-header=\"8. How do you continue growing once both sides are working?\" id=\"section--13\"></div>8. How do you continue growing once both sides are working?</h4>\n<p>With both sides humming, what\u2019s next? How do you continue building and growing the business once both sides are working, reinforcing one another? The common theme is that you have to find ways to nurture demand for your product. Komodo focused downstream, building relationships with professional service providers and brokering channel partnerships, which unlock new ways of distribution.</p>\n<p><strong>Arif:</strong> What\u2019s happened over time is that our relationship with these consultants has grown to the point where they\u2019re the equivalent of a system integrator in a workflow software setting, meaning that they\u2019re the ones that actually carry the last mile often for our customers. And so we\u2019ve made it really easy for them to operate on the Komodo platform. By doing that, we give our customers the alternative of working with their favorite set of consultants or their favorite sort of integrators. And that has actually strengthened our relationship, both with the ecosystem as well as with our customers. So that I don\u2019t say no. I say, guess what? Here are five companies that you could work with that\u2019ll take care of this and take care of this on your terms. And we work with all of them.</p>\n<p><strong>Jay:</strong> So our fourth takeaway is to look for potential channels and opportunities to help your customers use your products.</p>\n<p>Another interesting insight is from GoodRx, who focused on building mini sprint teams to continue launching new products and features to expand their product surface area across healthcare.</p>\n<p><strong>Doug:</strong> So we spend a lot of time and effort on figuring out how to build small squads to take risks, try things out that don\u2019t necessarily have a direct ROI right now attached to them, with a small group so that we can continue to invest in other ways to fix healthcare.The nice thing about healthcare is there\u2019s just so many markets to go into.</p>\n<p><strong>Jay:</strong> And this highlights our last key takeaway, which is to establish whichever processes are true to your culture, to ensure you continue to launch new products over time.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Investor-Perspective-Key-Takeways-FIELD-Macro-View.jpg?ssl=1\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-314110\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"1080\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Investor-Perspective-Key-Takeways-FIELD-Macro-View.jpg?resize=1920%2C1080&amp;ssl=1\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Investor-Perspective-Key-Takeways-FIELD-Macro-View.jpg?w=1920&amp;ssl=1 1920w, https://i0.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Investor-Perspective-Key-Takeways-FIELD-Macro-View.jpg?resize=300%2C169&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Investor-Perspective-Key-Takeways-FIELD-Macro-View.jpg?resize=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Investor-Perspective-Key-Takeways-FIELD-Macro-View.jpg?resize=768%2C432&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Investor-Perspective-Key-Takeways-FIELD-Macro-View.jpg?resize=1536%2C864&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Investor-Perspective-Key-Takeways-FIELD-Macro-View.jpg?resize=1120%2C630&amp;ssl=1 1120w, https://i0.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Investor-Perspective-Key-Takeways-FIELD-Macro-View.jpg?resize=125%2C70&amp;ssl=1 125w, https://i0.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Investor-Perspective-Key-Takeways-FIELD-Macro-View.jpg?resize=740%2C416&amp;ssl=1 740w, https://i0.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Investor-Perspective-Key-Takeways-FIELD-Macro-View.jpg?resize=587%2C330&amp;ssl=1 587w\" width=\"1920\"/></a></p>\n<h3><div data-toc-header=\"Investor perspective\" id=\"section--14\"></div>Investor perspective</h3>\n<p>At a16z, we\u2019re incredibly optimistic about the scaled impact these multi-sided network businesses can have on our disjointed healthcare system, but they\u2019re clearly not easy to build. So how do we as investors even go about evaluating businesses like this? Well, we take each side in turn and we benchmark each side\u2019s individual performance to best-in-class healthcare software businesses.</p>\n<p>Our firm has written extensively on this (including <a href=\"https://future.com/compete-or-connect-business-models-bio/\">here</a>, <a href=\"https://a16z.com/2016/07/19/marketplaces-networks/\">here</a>, <a href=\"https://future.com/podcasts/growth-engagement-retention/\">here</a>, <a href=\"https://future.com/marketplace-metrics/\">here</a>, <a href=\"https://future.com/marketplace-100/\">here</a>, <a href=\"https://future.com/gmv-retention-marketplace-metric/\">here</a>, &amp; <a href=\"https://future.com/metcalfes-network-effects-and-a-better-model/\">here</a>) but to highlight:</p>\n<p>First, we\u2019re looking for early indicators of lock-in or product-market fit. On the first side, this spans five elements.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Investor-Perspective-01.jpg?ssl=1\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-314111\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"1080\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Investor-Perspective-01.jpg?resize=1920%2C1080&amp;ssl=1\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Investor-Perspective-01.jpg?w=1920&amp;ssl=1 1920w, https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Investor-Perspective-01.jpg?resize=300%2C169&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Investor-Perspective-01.jpg?resize=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Investor-Perspective-01.jpg?resize=768%2C432&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Investor-Perspective-01.jpg?resize=1536%2C864&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Investor-Perspective-01.jpg?resize=1120%2C630&amp;ssl=1 1120w, https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Investor-Perspective-01.jpg?resize=125%2C70&amp;ssl=1 125w, https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Investor-Perspective-01.jpg?resize=740%2C416&amp;ssl=1 740w, https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Investor-Perspective-01.jpg?resize=587%2C330&amp;ssl=1 587w\" width=\"1920\"/></a></p>\n<p><strong>Adoption.</strong> Are people signing up? We can measure this in account growth, user growth, revenue growth.</p>\n<p><strong>Engagement.</strong> Are they using it? We can measure this in time spent in the product, number of clicks, number of transactions, number of visits or whatever the appropriate unit of engagement is to understand engagement frequency and quality.</p>\n<p><strong>Retention.</strong> Are they coming back to the product? How long do they stick with the product? Typically we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re looking at retention curves through 3, 6, 12 months to understand how much your existing customers are fueling your growth and how favorable your acquisition economics are.</p>\n<p><strong>Efficiency.</strong> Is growth getting easier over time? Is your incremental acquisition cost going down? Perhaps there\u2019s a network effect emerging that is really driving word-of-mouth referrals and decreasing your dependency on paid acquisition.</p>\n<p><strong>Data access.</strong> Are you learning from your users and your product? Are you sufficiently receiving information through the first side of the business that enables the subsequent sides of the business?</p>\n<p>Ultimately, we get excited by signs that it\u2019s easier to grow the customer base over time.</p>\n<p>Then we look for evidence that the second side is reinforcing the first, or that the two-sided network is starting to take form with line of sight to long term durability and attractive economics, even if the business is still taking shape.</p>\n<p>We again, look across the same dimensions of adoption, engagement, retention, as well as the efficiency of that growth. But here we have the added lens of looking for qualitative examples of customer use cases that are only possible because of the first side of the business.</p>\n<p>And across both, we want to understand your theory of defensibility. Both from disintermediation between the constituents you\u2019re connecting as well as from margin or take rate compression on each side as any one constituent gains share, or you have new competition. Some of this will look slightly different depending on whether you monetize via SaaS fees on each side or by a per transaction marketplace model. But at a high level, these are some of the ways we look to understand these types of businesses.</p>\n<p><strong>Vineeta:</strong> Thank you all again for listening and thank you to the founders who contributed their hard earned lessons in this episode of healthcare go-to-market strategy.

We\u2019re gradually approaching human parity in a number of human tasks, especially in perception, from computer vision to speech to more and more natural language.</p>\n<p>The leftmost is talking about our work in object recognition. Some of you might know that RESNET is now the most popular deep neural net in computer vision. My students and I actually invented it in our research lab in Beijing using 152 layers of neural networks. We accomplished 96% of the accuracy for ImageNet, that is the image database that people typically use to do recognition. That\u2019s really amazing and at least as good as any Stanford graduate student to do this type of recognition.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Harry-Shum-Slides.003.jpeg?ssl=1\"><img alt=\"latest AI breakthroughs\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-297673\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"576\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Harry-Shum-Slides.003.jpeg?resize=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1\" width=\"1024\"/></a></p>\n<p>The second box shows our progress in speech recognition. In speech, there\u2019s this very standard dataset called a Switchboard dataset that records two sides of a phone conversation. Two years ago, we accomplished 5.1% of the error rates. That is really, really amazing. The human error rate of 5.2% is for professionals doing transcripts. Most of us actually have up to 9% of error rates when we do speech recognition. You may not believe that we have such a high error rate, but you\u2019ll understand that when you go home and talk to your spouse.</p>\n<p>So, we continue to march on and make a lot of progress in machine reading comprehension using Stanford SQuAD database and also in machine translation. This 69.9% number is actually for English-Chinese and Chinese-English machine translation on the news corpus. Most recently, we have been working on conversational AI. All of these things show that we\u2019re gradually approaching human parity.</p>\n<p>But what does this really mean? It means that we can actually now enable a lot of interesting innovations.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Harry-Shum-Slides.005.jpeg?ssl=1\"><img alt=\"Meet Xiaoice\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-297675\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"576\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Harry-Shum-Slides.005.jpeg?resize=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1\" width=\"1024\"/></a></p>\n<p>Let me give you an example of what we have been working hard on in China and in Japan. It\u2019s actually our social chatbot called Xiaoice. Xiaoice is really popular with 120 million monthly active users.</p>\n<p>But even more interestingly, she\u2019s very famous. In China, she\u2019s on 60 TV programs and radio shows.</p>\n<p>And she\u2019s very creative. She writes music and sings very well. She is also a good writer and writes poems. She actually published a book \u00e2\u0080\u0094 I wrote the foreword for this book.</p>\n<p>She can paint. Amazingly, using a pseudonym, she graduated from Chinese Central Academy of Fine Arts this summer as a master student. It\u2019s really, really amazing.</p>\n<p>But what\u2019s most exciting to me is how we have been designing this social chatbot by incorporating EQ. This is very important because with IQ, we\u2019re helping people accomplish tasks. With EQ, we have empathy, social skills, and the understanding of human beings\u2019 feelings and emotions. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s important because it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to help chatbots to extend the length of conversation.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Harry-Shum-Slides.010.jpeg?ssl=1\"><img alt=\"Digital assistant conversation turns per session\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-297680\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"576\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Harry-Shum-Slides.010.jpeg?resize=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1\" width=\"1024\"/></a></p>\n<p>I\u2019m sure you use some kind of digital assistant, whether on your phone or with speakers. A typical digital assistant on the market will have roughly a few turns of conversation with you, but Xiaoice\u2019s CPS (or conversation turns per session) on average actually achieves 23 times. That is a stunning number. Incredibly, the longest conversation any human user has had with [chatbot] Xiaoice is over 29 hours of 7,000 turns. I guess some people just have too much time.</p>\n<span class=\"bctt-click-to-tweet\"><span class=\"bctt-ctt-text\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https://a16z.com/2020/01/16/biases-and-black-boxes-a-call-for-ai-transparency/&amp;text=Incredibly%2C%20the%20longest%20conversation%20any%20human%20user%20has%20had%20with%20the%20chatbot%20Xiaoice%20is%20over%2029%20hours%20of%207%2C000%20turns.&amp;via=a16z&amp;related=a16z\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Incredibly, the longest conversation any human user has had with the chatbot Xiaoice is over 29 hours of 7,000 turns. </a></span><a class=\"bctt-ctt-btn\" href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https://a16z.com/2020/01/16/biases-and-black-boxes-a-call-for-ai-transparency/&amp;text=Incredibly%2C%20the%20longest%20conversation%20any%20human%20user%20has%20had%20with%20the%20chatbot%20Xiaoice%20is%20over%2029%20hours%20of%207%2C000%20turns.&amp;via=a16z&amp;related=a16z\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Click To Tweet</a></span>\n<p>Then, you say, \u201cWell, you have this kind of capability. What can you really do for a business?\u201d</p>\n<p>I will give you a very exciting example. We have collaborated with Lawson, which is the second biggest retail chain in Japan. We used Xiaoice and Xiaoice\u2019s EQ to power Akiko. Xiaoice is really the voice persona and online persona that Lawson has.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Harry-Shum-Slides.011.jpeg?ssl=1\"><img alt=\"Xiaoice powers Akiko\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-297681\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"576\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Harry-Shum-Slides.011.jpeg?resize=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1\" width=\"1024\"/></a></p>\n<p>So, we did an experiment with Lawson using Akiko. We basically have Akiko talk to the Japanese users. She can chat, recommend a product, and conduct surveys at appropriate times, and even distribute coupons. So, we did an experiment with the coupons and distributed a million coupons in 13 hours. The in-store conversion rate hit 40% in the next 4 days. For those of you who understand coupons, this is really an amazing number.</p>\n<p>And of course, we can apply this kind of technology to different verticals. We actually now power 90% of the quarterly earnings report summaries for 90% of Chinese companies, also powered by Xiaoice. All of these things are possible because of the huge amount of data that we use to train the AI.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Harry-Shum-Slides.012.jpeg?ssl=1\"><img alt=\"Xiaoice financial reports\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-297682\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"576\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Harry-Shum-Slides.012.jpeg?resize=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1\" width=\"1024\"/></a></p>\n<p>With more and more data using AI, and with more and more complex AI models, especially with deep learning models, we actually face some serious challenges. In particular, AI bias and explainable AI.</p>\n<p>I assume that many of us in the room probably have seen DHH\u2019s tweet a few days ago about the Apple Card created by Goldman Sachs. If you think about what really happened, you probably would agree with me that very likely there is some kind of AI bias in the machine learning system they built. They really need to do a better job to have an explainable AI for why this kind of credit decision was made.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Harry-Shum-Slides.017.jpeg?ssl=1\"><img alt=\"He's brilliant, she's lovely\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-297687\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"576\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Harry-Shum-Slides.017.jpeg?resize=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1\" width=\"1024\"/></a></p>\n<p>Let me give you another motivational example that we have been working on in Microsoft. NPR interviewed my colleagues and wrote this article called \u201cHe\u2019s Brilliant, She\u2019s Lovely: Teaching Computers To Be Less Sexist.\u201d</p>\n<p>We actually trained the machine learning system to do job classification. We defined 27 job titles at the bottom. Then, we took someone\u2019s bio. This person is a philanthropist, but we don\u2019t really have philanthropists in our training. So, we run through the system with this bio, and the system says, \u201cThis person is a teacher.\u201d Well, this is reasonable if you read the text.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Harry-Shum-Slides.021.jpeg?ssl=1\"><img alt=\"she is a teacher\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-297691\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"576\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Harry-Shum-Slides.021.jpeg?resize=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1\" width=\"1024\"/></a></p>\n<p>But if we change nothing, but only a few words from she to he, from her to his, this is what the system says. [on slide: \u00e2\u0080\u009cTeacher\u00e2\u0080\u009d changes to \u00e2\u0080\u009cAttorney\u00e2\u0080\u009d]</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Harry-Shum-Slides.023.jpeg?ssl=1\"><img alt=\"he is an attorney\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-297693\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"576\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Harry-Shum-Slides.023.jpeg?resize=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1\" width=\"1024\"/></a></p>\n<p>Now you start to see the problem. Maybe this machine learning system is not as accurate as you would like to see. it might have inherited some bias because of the data we use to train it.</p>\n<p>So, what\u2019s really happening there? We decided to dig into that and use something in natural language processing called word embedding. It\u2019s multi-dimensional geometry, but there are really two very important concepts: proximity and parallelism.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Harry-Shum-Slides.025.jpeg?ssl=1\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-297695\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"576\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Harry-Shum-Slides.025.jpeg?resize=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1\" width=\"1024\"/></a></p>\n<p>Let me explain to you what we\u2019re really talking about here. If you think about Apple and Microsoft and you think about Cupertino and Redmond, you\u2019ll say, \u201cWell, they\u2019re really very strongly correlated.\u201d Cupertino to Apple as the location is the same as Redmond to Microsoft. Similarly, Steve Jobs and Bill Gates are founders of those companies.</p>\n<p>So, now let\u2019s use this word embedding to take a look at the relationship between he and she. So, she to he is analogous to sister to\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 [asks audience] I\u2019m sure you guys know. So, brother.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Harry-Shum-Slides.029.jpeg?ssl=1\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-297699\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"576\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Harry-Shum-Slides.029.jpeg?resize=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1\" width=\"1024\"/></a></p>\n<p>Okay. So far so good. Let me warm you up. And she is a nurse and he is [screen shows \u00e2\u0080\u009cDoctor\u00e2\u0080\u009d]</p>\n<p>Now, you start to see the problem. She is a homemaker and he is a computer programmer.</p>\n<p>By the way, we didn\u2019t do anything. We just used the training dataset from Google. It has nothing to do with us but everything to do with the data.</p>\n<p>So, now, she says, \u201cOh my God.\u201d And what would he say?  Don\u2019t be shy. I know some of you guys say that.</p>\n<p>The next one, if you get it, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll offer you a Microsoft internship. So, she is a feminist. He is\u2026 [asks audience] anyone? Well, it\u2019s not easy to get an internship at Microsoft. Well, someone says chauvinist and that\u2019s actually not too bad a guess. </p>\n<p>Here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the last one, and if you get it, I\u2019ll immediately offer you a job at Microsoft full time. So, she has a pregnancy.  So, you get it, you get it.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Harry-Shum-Slides.039.jpeg?ssl=1\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-297709\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"576\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Harry-Shum-Slides.039.jpeg?resize=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1\" width=\"1024\"/></a></p>\n<p>So again, this is all analyzed from the data. The data we collected over the internet has some inherited bias. If we just blindly use the data to train AI, we know we will have problems.</p>\n<p>This is actually a more complete view about the number of words coming from this dataset. If we plot in two dimensions, horizontal axis all the way to the right are words that have nothing to do with gender. All the way to the left have words that are strongly correlated with gender. If you go up, it\u2019s more about \u00e2\u0080\u009cshe\u00e2\u0080\u009d and if you go down it\u2019s more about \u00e2\u0080\u009che.\u00e2\u0080\u009d</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Harry-Shum-Slides.040.jpeg?ssl=1\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-297710\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"576\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Harry-Shum-Slides.040.jpeg?resize=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1\" width=\"1024\"/></a></p>\n<p>Now, you really start to see the problem. You know why are genius and brilliance more associated with a man versus a woman.</p>\n<p>Once we understand the problem, of course, we can think about how we can deal with it. One approach you could take is to try to squash the vertical axis and you could say that brilliant should be applied to all kinds of genders.</p>\n<p>We actually wrote this award-winning paper on this which you can find on the internet.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Harry-Shum-Slides.041.jpeg?ssl=1\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-297711\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"576\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Harry-Shum-Slides.041.jpeg?resize=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1\" width=\"1024\"/></a></p>\n<p>Let me quickly move to the second topic, which I think is just as important. It\u2019s about explainable AI. So, why is this a problem? Because we now train all kinds of complex models with millions, even trillions, of parameters. Effectively, we are building AIs as black boxes and that\u2019s a problem because in order to trust AI, we need to really have transparent AI. We have to open the black box up to understand each and every piece of the decision.</p>\n<span class=\"bctt-click-to-tweet\"><span class=\"bctt-ctt-text\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https://a16z.com/2020/01/16/biases-and-black-boxes-a-call-for-ai-transparency/&amp;text=in%20order%20to%20trust%20AI%2C%20we%20need%20to%20really%20have%20transparent%20AI.%20We%20have%20to%20open%20the%20black%20box%20up%20to%20understand%20each%20and%20every%20piece%20of%20the%20decision.&amp;via=a16z&amp;related=a16z\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">in order to trust AI, we need to really have transparent AI.

The first one is very obvious. That is AI, machine learning, are just the latest tools. We use those tools to help users do a better job. So, that is about augmenting humans.</p>\n<p>Second, I think you will also understand pretty well. Basically, we need AI to be transparent. Why are we making these decisions? Can I trust this AI? You might think it\u2019s probably harmless to get some kind of Netflix recommendation about the movies you watch. But political ads on social networks can be problematic. Medical diagnosis or even military decisions based on AI can be deadly.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Harry-Shum-Slides.052.jpeg?ssl=1\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-297722\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"576\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Harry-Shum-Slides.052.jpeg?resize=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1\" width=\"1024\"/></a></p>\n<p>The third one really is more for AI practitioners. That is, if we want to help humans improve AI, we need to understand it, to really dig down the system to understand where are those errors happening? To which part of the data segments? With which part of the model? For example, do we see bias? Where\u2019s the bias from?</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Harry-Shum-Slides.054.jpeg?ssl=1\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-297724\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"576\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Harry-Shum-Slides.054.jpeg?resize=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1\" width=\"1024\"/></a></p>\n<p>A lot of people nowadays are working very, very hard, really thinking about the different kinds of machine learning models. How can we make them both explainable and also very accurate?</p>\n<p>The graph shows that the horizontal axis is really the explainability. The more to the right, the more you can actually explain. For example, logic regression is something that we all understand. If we go all the way up, we\u2019re getting bigger and bigger models and the models are getting more and more accurate.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Harry-Shum-Slides.055.jpeg?ssl=1\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-297725\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"576\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Harry-Shum-Slides.055.jpeg?resize=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1\" width=\"1024\"/></a></p>\n<p>So, what\u2019s happening? What\u2019s in the field? There are two schools of thought. One is that you start with simple, explainable models on the lower right. Then you try to explain, improve the model, and then push it up. For example, the GA2M model is really this new version of a generalized additive model.</p>\n<p>Most of the effort in the field is actually on the top left going all the way to the right. That is, you start with some kind of very accurate model and the model agnostic. Then you try to explain it using some kind of local approach.</p>\n<p>I\u2019m going to just finish my presentation by coming back to, opening up the black box, and why it\u2019s very, very important that we have transparent AI. We are going to be the first generation of humans to ever live with AI. I see tremendous business opportunities by doing AI. I also worry about and believe we have tremendous social responsibilities to develop the AI because I really believe we cannot accept a future where AI is making decisions that we cannot explain and we cannot understand.</p>\n<span class=\"bctt-click-to-tweet\"><span class=\"bctt-ctt-text\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https://a16z.com/2020/01/16/biases-and-black-boxes-a-call-for-ai-transparency/&amp;text=We%20are%20going%20to%20be%20the%20first%20generation%20of%20humans%20to%20ever%20live%20with%20AI.%20I%20see%20tremendous%20business%20opportunities%20by%20doing%20AI...%20I%20also%20believe%20we%20cannot%20accept%20a%20future%20where%20AI%20is%20making%20decisions%20that%20we%20cannot%20explain.&amp;via=a16z&amp;related=a16z\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">We are going to be the first generation of humans to ever live with AI.

Today we have one of our special episodes live from the road \u2014 well, not really live, but recorded during the JPM health conference here in San Francisco this week \u2014 so in this conversation, a16z bio general partners Jorge Conde and Vijay Pande join me to interview special guest Vas Narasimhan, the CEO of Novartis, which is one of the largest healthcare and pharmaceutical companies in the world: In terms of </em>volume<em>, they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re the largest producer of medicines, with 70 billion doses a year across a wide range of therapeutic areas from cancer to cardiovascular disease and more.</em><em>\u00c2\u00a0</em></p>\n<p><em>So in this episode, we cover everything from the latest trends in therapeutics \u2014 from cell and gene therapies to RNA and proteins to other emerging areas and what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s science vs science fiction \u2014 we also briefly touch on clinical trials, go to market, talent, hubs, startups working with big pharma. And throughout, we consider where tech comes into all of this, and what happens </em><em><a href=\"https://a16z.com/tag/engineering-science/\">when science becomes engineering</a></em><em>. </em></p>\n<p><em>But we begin with the *business* of science \u2014 and innovation, both inside and outside\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 </em></p>\n<p><strong>Vas:</strong> You build up R&amp;D expertise in our industry over long periods of time. If you think about cardiovascular disease, we\u2019ve been in it 40, 50 years. When you think about transplant and immunology, again, 40, 50 years; oncology, 25 years. So you build up an accumulated expertise, and really the art of it is to make sure you have a depth of new medicines to keep filling your pipeline in each one of those therapeutic areas. Now there are instances where we find new breakthroughs in areas we\u2019re not in, those you have to really think about, think about, are you gonna really stay in that area for the long term?</p>\n<p>The other element of the story is when you really have exhausted your pipeline. We\u2019re not so good as an industry at this, but you have to also be prepared to exit, I think, areas where you\u2019re gonna be sub-scale. And that\u2019s something we\u2019re working on; we\u2019ve made a number of exits actually this year where we\u2019ve just said, this is areas we just can\u2019t sustain longer term.</p>\n<p><strong>Sonal:</strong> Can you give us a little bit more color on how you make those decisions, especially as, as a CEO steering this? That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a pretty big \u2014 I mean frankly it\u2019s a decision that every big company, regardless of industry, has to think about, which is essentially what to proactively invest in and what to proactively opt out of \u2014 \u00e2\u0080\u009ckilling things\u00e2\u0080\u009d, as we call it in the media business, is a pretty hard thing to do \u2014 How do you think about that, and how do you tease apart the signal from the noise when you get a lot of inputs both internally <em>and</em> externally?</p>\n<p><strong>Vas:</strong> So we do it currently in, at two levels. One is, from an overall portfolio standpoint, we\u2019ve made the decision to really focus as a medicines company powered by advanced therapy platforms and data science. So in order to really make that happen we transacted in 2018 around $50B of deals to really change the shape of the company. We took principled decisions to leave consumer healthcare because we just didn\u2019t believe we\u2019d be a long-term leader in consumer healthcare; a decision to spin our Alcon business, which is to get out of medical devices and contact lenses. And alongside that, as we\u2019ve moved out of those other areas, we made significant investments, acquisitions in this next wave of therapy: cell therapy, gene therapy, and in an area called, \u00e2\u0080\u009cradio-drug conjugates\u00e2\u0080\u009d, which is a nuclear medicine kind of area.</p>\n<p>So that was at one level, at the portfolio level, changing a 20-plus-year trajectory to actually become a very diversified company. It really came out of a conviction in my mind that science is moving so fast you have to focus your capital and really focus your energies.</p>\n<p>That\u2019s at the macro level.</p>\n<p>Now when you zoom into innovative medicine, we have to decide, okay, which therapeutic area do we stay in, cardiovascular disease \u2014 or do we stay in ophthalmology? I mean, those are pretty tough decisions, because if you take down an R&amp;D effort\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 So one example for us was infectious diseases where we had a longstanding effort \u2014 it was not an easy decision \u2014 there was a lot of going around, are we really sure? Because you can\u2019t change your mind now, you know, in three or four years and say, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI wish I had it back.\u00e2\u0080\u009d It will take you another 10 years to build it back up again.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"pullquote pullquote--orange\"><p><strong><em>You can\u2019t change your mind in three or four years and say, \u201cI wish I had it back.\u201d It will take you another 10 years to build it back up again.</em></strong></p></blockquote>\n<p><strong>Jorge:</strong> The cycles of innovation in science are accelerating, the science is moving much more quickly than it has in the past. So assuming that that\u2019s the case, will it continue to be true that it will take decades to build expertise in any given therapeutic area? In other words, will there be future emerging players that come much more quickly than they have historically?</p>\n<blockquote class=\"pullquote pullquote--orange\"><p><strong><em>While the pace of science is improving dramatically, we also have to keep reminding ourselves and being humble with the fact that we understand a fraction of human biology.</em></strong></p></blockquote>\n<p><strong>Vas:</strong> I think there can be very fast players who are really working on a couple of medicines or a couple of assets. But when I talk about building up a capability I\u2019m really talking about a scaled capability that could generate new medicines consistently over time.</p>\n<p>And while I do believe the pace of science is improving dramatically, we also have to keep reminding ourselves and being humble with the fact that we understand a fraction of human biology. And actually when you look at attrition rates in our industry \u2014 really the chances of success that we have \u2014 they haven\u2019t moved in the last 15 years. Still when we bring a medicine into human beings, on average only 1 out of 20 works, finally.</p>\n<p>And that has stayed constant despite we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve had this explosion in new science.</p>\n<p><strong>Sonal:</strong> So I wanna quickly pause on that for a moment because that\u2019s a pretty important point. So only \u2014 over the last, say, 10, 20 years, only 1 out of 20 medicines actually work in the human body?</p>\n<p><strong>Vas:</strong> Once we get it into human beings we have about a 5, 5-10% success rate, &lt;Sonal: wow!&gt; and it varies by therapeutic area. We\u2019ve actually been fortunate at our company we average in that same metric about 8% to 10%, But if you look industry-wide it is about 5%.</p>\n<p><strong>Vijay:</strong> The attrition rates are pretty constant, but the costs still keep going up, too.</p>\n<p><strong>Vas:</strong> They do.</p>\n<p><strong>Vijay:</strong> How does that work out? Because in a sense, one analogy that people use is almost like trying to get oil out of the ground, and you know, the low-lying fruit \u2014 I\u2019m mixing analogies here! \u2014 but the low-lying fruit has been taken and it\u2019s just harder and harder to find new therapeutics.</p>\n<p>Or do you feel like the science is moving fast enough that that\u2019s not an issue?</p>\n<p><strong>Vas:</strong> I think we go through waves. There was a period of time where probably in the 1990s and early 2000s we had a pretty big wave of innovation and we could bring a lot of medicines forward. &lt;Vijay: yah&gt; We went through a lull for seven to eight years.</p>\n<p>Now with, again, the explosion and ability to really understand the mechanisms of disease we\u2019re seeing a renaissance, a record number of FDA approvals. We\u2019re investing heavily in new therapy areas. I mean, 15 years ago people would\u2019ve said, \u201cYou\u2019re crazy if you think we\u2019re gonna do gene therapy and cell therapy\u201d \u2014 and all of the things now that we\u2019re doing at scale.</p>\n<p>You know, the costs really come from our ability to manage complexity. When you look at it over time the trials get more complex. The requirements from regulators get more complex. Because the science gets more complex, we can actually measure more things, so we add, and add, and add, and that\u2019s led to an interesting pretty linear increase in costs per patient in our clinical trials.</p>\n<p>I don\u2019t think it has to be that way. I think what really our industry has not been great at is really deploying technology to make this much more efficient, so I think there\u2019s a lot of opportunity.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"pullquote pullquote--orange\"><p><strong><em>The costs really come from our ability to manage complexity.</em></strong></p></blockquote>\n<p><strong>Vijay:</strong> And why do you think that\u2019s the case, that it\u2019s been so hard to deploy?</p>\n<p><strong>Vas:</strong> I think it\u2019s \u2014 you know, we\u2019re a high-margin industry, so unless it\u2019s easy enough just to keep arguing to yourself it doesn\u2019t really matter as long as we get another big medicine out it\u2019s okay. Let\u2019s just keep going.</p>\n<p><strong>Vijay:</strong> Yeah, well \u2014 if you screw things up there\u2019s a huge cost.</p>\n<p><strong>Vas:</strong> There\u2019s a big downside. But I think now we\u2019re reaching the point where we have no choice but to really now engage technology. I mean, there are estimates now from various sources that believe you could take out 20% of clinical trials costs if you were to actually to really deploy technology at scale.</p>\n<p><strong>Jorge:</strong> If the attrition rates have been flat for as long as they\u2019ve been, and there have been all these proliferations of new platforms out there \u2014 these gene therapies \u2014 is there a measure that you qualitatively \u2014 or even quantitatively! \u2014 can look at that says the medicines that are getting through are meaningfully better medicines, or different medicines?</p>\n<p>In other words, the failure rate might be the same, but the impact of success is it greater now in any measurable way?</p>\n<p><strong>Vas:</strong> So it\u2019s a very important point, and there\u2019s no objective measure. I mean, various institutes have different measures, but nothing I think that is used externally. We internally have just set a very clear bar now for ourselves, primarily because we live in a world now where nobody wants a \u00e2\u0080\u009cme-too\u00e2\u0080\u009d medicine, or a medicine that\u2019s just incrementally better. We say to ourselves, it has to replace the standard of care. And that usually means it gives such a big clinical benefit to patients that it just becomes the de facto medicine of choice in that therapeutic area.</p>\n<p>That\u2019s a shift. It means a lot of projects no longer make the cut because you\u2019re really asking yourself, If I don\u2019t have something really transformative, I\u2019m not gonna take it forward anymore. And so all of our research teams and development teams are having to now come to grips with that: that we will stop projects, unless we really believe it can redefine the standard of care.</p>\n<p><strong>Sonal:</strong> I have a process question behind this because it\u2019s parallel to <a href=\"https://a16z.com/2015/06/08/performance-data-and-the-babe-ruth-effect-in-venture-capital/\">this idea</a> of basically going for a slugging average vs. batting average \u2014 outsize hits with great outsized impact. So behind the scenes, what are some of the mindsets that you and the R&amp;D teams bring to bear to make these investments for slugging versus batting average; how do you set things up to make that happen?</p>\n<p><strong>Vas:</strong> We have all of the various review committees, and portfolio meetings, etc. But really what it takes is a lot of discipline about the criteria that you\u2019re using. So we have very clear criteria and we try to apply that rigor. I there\u2019s a lot of romanticization in R&amp;D about big ideas. So much of it is just about discipline, and discipline.</p>\n<p><strong>Sonal:</strong> Right, the nitty gritty.</p>\n<p><strong>Vas:</strong> The nitty gritty. Disciplined execution of how you look at projects. So I think that\u2019s one element.</p>\n<p>I think second you have to build patience, because part of the reason mediocre projects go forward is you start to worry you don\u2019t have enough in the pipeline, and you start to lose faith that something\u2019s gonna come.</p>\n<p>And you have to believe in your own scientists and your own R&amp;D engine to say, I\u2019m gonna say no five times \u00e2\u0080\u0098cause I believe the sixth one could be the big one \u2014 rather than get worried and just start letting things through, because actually what you do is you crowd out the money.</p>\n<p><strong>Vijay:</strong> It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an opportunity cost.</p>\n<p><strong>Vas:</strong> It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a huge opportunity cost when you take those, and that\u2019s been a real ongoing challenge for us. I think the third element is to bring a real lens of what does it take to be successful in the market?</p>\n<p>Historically we just had a belief that if we had a great product it\u2019ll all work itself out. Now we actually ask the market access teams that have to negotiate with payers to show up at every meeting and say, \u201cActually even in phase two it\u2019s a really early for us. What is it really gonna take to, let\u2019s say, bring a new medicine forward in ASMR, a new medicine forward in multiple sclerosis?\u201d And if we don\u2019t make the cut we just have to be brutally honest with ourselves.</p>\n<p><strong>Vijay:</strong> Are reimbursements more important, or more on your mind, than for just getting past the FDA?</p>\n<p><strong>Vas:</strong> It used to be we\u2019d think about reimbursement as we got to launch. Now we\u2019re thinking about it really early in development.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"pullquote pullquote--orange\"><p><em><strong>Historically we just had a belief that if we had a great product it\u2019ll all work itself out.</strong></em></p></blockquote>\n<p><strong>Vijay:</strong> For people that are new to this space \u2014 or just a lot of entrepreneurs, they think that the FDA is the real challenge and just getting something through clinical trials is expensive, and hard. And that\u2019s true.</p>\n<p>But the reimbursement \u2014 being first in class, having this huge jump in care \u2014 that is the real challenge. And so what I would love to see, especially in our founders, is for them to work <em>backwards</em> \u2014 but work backwards not from getting through trials, but work backwards from reimbursement. &lt;Sonal: Ahh, fascinating.&gt;</p>\n<p><strong>Jorge:</strong> And the way that Vas describes it is absolutely true, a lot of people view reimbursement as a process to get to market access.</p>\n<p>But reimbursement is really just a proxy for value proposition\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 So what are the actual user stories? Who\u2019s gonna actually value this? Who\u2019s willing to pay?</p>\n<p>It\u2019s almost like a pricing study, and it\u2019s almost like price discovery in the consumer world. In this case it\u2019s obviously the payers, not the direct beneficiary of the therapeutic. But they do bear the burden of the cost. And so they\u2019re the great arbiter of saying, Is there a true value proposition? And that\u2019s why when you talk about industry moving away from me-too drugs, it was because a me-too drug arguably could not show a very significant marginal increase in value proposition and therefore it was very difficult to justify and increase the premium price. And so that historically has been the big challenge.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"pullquote pullquote--orange\"><p><em><strong>A lot of people view reimbursement as a process to get to market access.\u00c2\u00a0But reimbursement is really just a proxy for value.</strong></em></p></blockquote>\n<p><strong>Sonal:</strong> On that note, I do find it ironic that a big part of business is still generics. I mean, what is that but a me-too drug? How does that fit into this big picture?</p>\n<p><strong>Vas:</strong> Yeah, so, you know, if you look overall at Novartis, generics from a sales standpoint and a value standpoint, it\u2019s a small portion of the company.</p>\n<p>But look at a volume standpoint, and it\u2019s the biggest part of <em>access</em>. And so really what our generics business does is when medicines go off patent, we then produce them at scale. I mean we\u2019re the largest producer, for example, penicillin in the world. So we have a huge role to play in providing access to medicines around the world. I mean, right now Novartis reaches about a billion patients a year through our work, and a lot of that is through our Sandoz generics unit.</p>\n<p><strong>Jorge:</strong> So if you break it down, if there\u2019s 70 billion doses that are Novartis drugs every year, how many of those 70 billion are generics?</p>\n<p><strong>Vas:</strong> I would say roughly 80% of that.</p>\n<p><strong>Sonal:</strong> And is it standard that big pharmaceutical companies have their own manufacturing facilities \u2014 and do you see that changing any time in the near future??</p>\n<p><strong>Vas:</strong> Most pharmaceutical companies have their own &lt;Sonal: ok&gt; manufacturing. I mean, there\u2019s different trends right now. There\u2019s a pretty significant increase of use of Chinese and other producers for many elements of the manufacturing, but still historically we\u2019ve had our manufacturing facilities.</p>\n<p>The biggest trend we have right now is a shift to these advanced therapy platforms. So what we\u2019re having to do is as our volumes go down \u2014 and the older medicines that were produced in huge volumes\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 we\u2019re now building up cell and gene therapy production facilities around the world. So that\u2019s a shift we\u2019re seeing.</p>\n<p><strong>Jorge:</strong> You talk about Novartis becoming a medicines company using data science and novel platforms, but you\u2019re very specific about saying \u00e2\u0080\u009c<a href=\"https://a16z.com/2019/02/07/what-is-a-medicine-jorge-conde/\">medicines</a>\u00e2\u0080\u009d. Are medicines and therapeutic synonyms in the Novartis mindset?</p>\n<p><strong>Vas:</strong> I would say yes. There\u2019s, of course, a gray zone here as to what is a therapeutic.</p>\n<p>But we would say, you know, medicines is our proxy for therapeutics. I mean, one example we launched in the U.S. a digital medicine. I mean, with Pear Therapeutics this is the first digital app with an FDA label that\u2019s being used for opioid addiction and other psychiatric illnesses. And it is literally an app that has run clinical trials and has gotten an FDA-approved label. So that\u2019s truly an example of a therapeutic, but I would put that within our world of medicines.</p>\n<p><strong>Jorge:</strong> So software is a drug?</p>\n<p><strong>Vas:</strong> Yeah, software as a drug.</p>\n<p><strong>Jorge:</strong> [What\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the] most surprising indication that you would expect to see for a digital therapeutic? Because I think most people assume that it\u2019s gonna be around behavioral health issues or addiction, like the work you\u2019ve done with Pear. Can you imagine moving beyond that from an indication standpoint for <a href=\"https://a16z.com/tag/digital-therapeutics/\">digital therapeutics</a>?</p>\n<p><strong>Vas:</strong> I mean, my hope would be we could develop one for obesity, right? That somehow that a digital therapeutic could actually just move the needle a little bit more on obesity \u2014 it\u2019s such a massive issue for society \u2014 and it should be one where a behavioral intervention on top of other interventions could actually move the needle. Because so much of it <em>is </em>behavioral.</p>\n<p><strong>Sonal:</strong> There\u2019s not an, example [of a digital therapeutic] that\u2019s non-behavioral in your future?</p>\n<p><strong>Jorge:</strong> Right, you\u2019re not curing sickle-cell [anemia] with an app!</p>\n<p><strong>Sonal:</strong> Right. I mean, I would put a guess around fertility, but one could argue that\u2019s also psychosomatic.</p>\n<p><strong>Vijay:</strong> Yah, behavioral\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 The thing is\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 if you think about the modern medical marvels, I think about antibiotics. I was sick when I was in college and I had a super high fever. I got an antibiotic and next few days I\u2019m fine. Maybe without that I\u2019d have been dead, and so that\u2019s kind of magical. And it\u2019s not like I have to take antibiotics for the rest of my life or whatever, I\u2019m just cured.</p>\n<p>But the amazing thing about behavioral is that\u2019s where you don\u2019t have this. I can\u2019t imagine that you have a molecule that cures depression, that you take and you\u2019re just done. Or you take a couple doses and then you no longer have Type II diabetes. And behavioral is really broad: It\u2019s depression, it\u2019s smoking cessation, it\u2019s Type II diabetes, it\u2019s even quite possibly Alzheimer\u2019s. I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve seen all these?</p>\n<p><strong>Sonal:</strong> I\u2019ve seen a lot of recent papers on this, it\u2019s fascinating.</p>\n<p><strong>Vijay:</strong> Yah, yah. And so these are actually the areas where if you look at the biology of Alzheimer\u2019s disease, that\u2019s just a <em>mess</em>, you know? It could be that for these things where you have a very clear target, I just have to hit the ribosome with the bacteria and then we\u2019re done. That\u2019s easy.</p>\n<p>But there may be actually in the future things where that just is hard to hit with a molecule, and all that is primarily behavioral.</p>\n<p><strong>Sonal:</strong> Interesting. So basically you\u2019re almost arguing the question might be moot because all of disease is behavioral in some capacity?</p>\n<p><strong>Vijay:</strong> Well, no \u2014 all the stuff that\u2019s hard. &lt;laughs&gt;</p>\n<p><strong>Jorge:</strong> Complex is complex\u00e2\u0080\u00a6</p>\n<p><strong>Vijay:</strong> The low-lying fruit, molecularly, is not behavioral.</p>\n<p><strong>Jorge:</strong> There\u2019s this infrastructure layer that\u2019s being created now around gene therapies. So as folks figure out manufacturing, as people think about delivery, as people think about all of the various components or modular aspects, do you think those are things that necessarily would be owned by one company \u2014 or are these horizontal infrastructure layers that a third party should develop and deploy across the industry? How do you think this plays out?</p>\n<p>In other words: Is there a startup that figures out AAVs? Do they, sort of, supply AAV to the industry or do they go and develop their own\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 gene therapy?</p>\n<p><strong>Vas:</strong> It\u2019s a very timely question; we don\u2019t know the answer yet. I think right now in this nascent phase that we\u2019re in, we believe that we need to just own it. Because the launches are so important, that we can\u2019t afford there to be a lot of experimentation and not really owning the supply chain. We\u2019ve done $15 billion of acquisitions just last year in this space, not including all of our internal work in each of these areas, so we\u2019ve chosen to build out the infrastructure ourselves.</p>\n<p>I think as the technology matures we\u2019ll get more comfortable about which areas we could send out. I also think the entrepreneurial world will also figure out where they can play a role. I think that\u2019s still all being figured out right now, and I actually don\u2019t have a view yet. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s gonna be the elements we must own and what are the elements that we could afford to give to other parties.</p>\n<p><strong>Sonal:</strong> You know, on that note, I\u2019d love to hear from you more about how you figured out the build vs. buy piece then. Because a big part of your work is focused on innovative medicines. And you made this argument that it takes 10 years to build up a base \u2014 even longer, 20, 30 years \u2014 and yet you\u2019re also acquiring the expertise for the very new, cutting-edge things. Which almost makes it seem like you don\u2019t have to even bother building up that base.</p>\n<p>Why not just acquire it? So how do you navigate the build versus buy part of this?</p>\n<p><strong>Vas:</strong> I think when you wanna enter very new areas, sometimes it\u2019s prudent to ask yourself, Does somebody have this much more figured out than you do?</p>\n<p>So if you take the example of gene therapy, we acquired a company called AveXis, really, I think, the front, leading-edge gene therapy company. Now the scientists at AveXis, they\u2019ve been working at this actually in their academic labs for 25 years. I mean, they\u2019ve been working on trying to hone how to use AAV vectors to get to the neuromuscular system of children to address these issues. They\u2019ve actually figured out the manufacturing. They built the manufacturing site. We were working on gene therapies ourselves in-house, but when we looked at that we said, this is an opportunity to really accelerate what we\u2019re doing. And so it made sense, I think, to go, to go external.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s always that balance. We are a company that\u2019s very focused internally on research. We consistently invest at the high end on internal R&amp;D simply because we believe that\u2019s the heart of the company. But what I\u2019m trying to keep asking our people is if there\u2019s somebody out there who\u2019s got it better than us, let\u2019s just go get that and then we\u2019ll build off of it.</p>\n<p><strong>Sonal:</strong> Yeah, I love that. But there<em> is</em> a classic NIH \u00e2\u0080\u0093 \u00e2\u0080\u009cNot Invented Here\u00e2\u0080\u009d syndrome \u2014</p>\n<p><strong>Vas:</strong> There is.</p>\n<p><strong>Sonal:</strong> \u2014 And when you have a strong internal R&amp;D culture, it does compete with NIH. A lot.</p>\n<p><strong>Vas:</strong> It does.</p>\n<p><strong>Sonal:</strong> So the question that really begs is, how do you then \u2014 with all these amazing acquisitions \u2014 integrate them into the company? And actually make sure the classic Chesbrough study of all these acquisitions not being killed by the big company\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 like, how do you balance that piece?</p>\n<p><strong>Vas:</strong> So I think there\u2019s two things I\u2019d say. One is, as an R&amp;D person I have sort of the ability to really get in there and have the discussions directly with the scientists and argue why we actually need to go external and really evaluate the case, with hopefully objective eyes.</p>\n<p>The other thing we\u2019ve decided to do, at least with these very new three technology platforms, is leave them as independent units \u00c2\u00a0and really let them grow up independent from the big R&amp;D and manufacturing machine &lt;Sonal: that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s right&gt;. Because I think exactly for that concern. It makes sense to let them build up, and really incubate these new technologies, get them all sorted out, and then we can ask the question, What\u2019s the right setup down the line?</p>\n<p><strong>Sonal:</strong> Right, right, right. That is what the classic studies show, that is the way to success. I did, by the way, find it very fascinating \u2014 because I wasn\u2019t aware that you have a scientific background? \u2014 it reminds me of this idea that we have around CTO-led [companies], you know really having technical people at the helm.</p>\n<p>So I am curious about your view \u2014 I mean, besides being able to talk to the internal scientists \u2014 how has that affected your own career and trajectory at Novartis so far?</p>\n<p><strong>Vas:</strong> Given the company\u2019s heart is innovative medicine, and most of my background has been in drug development and really developing vaccines, and then developing various medicines, I think it gives me a really good insight into the heart of the company, our key technologies. If you think about our pipeline today, I know every asset, every clinical trial, I know all the clinical trial end points.</p>\n<p>So that, I think, gives you a certain insight into where the company is heading. And also I think enables you to hopefully guide the company into the right areas in the future. I think it\u2019d be self-serving to say that it\u2019s better to have an MD/ R&amp;D person running companies, but I think it does give you a different perspective on an R&amp;D industry like ours.</p>\n<p><strong>Sonal:</strong> Right, it might even be able to help to be able to empathize when you are killing a project, that you actually know what it\u2019s like to feel that.</p>\n<p><strong>Vas:</strong> Well, that\u2019s for sure. &lt;laughs&gt;</p>\n<blockquote class=\"pullquote pullquote--orange\"><p><em><strong>So if you go back 10 years ago, something like a CAR-T therapy would\u2019ve seemed science fiction-y\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 or at least maybe 20 years ago.

CAR-T is the way we do that in cancer, but there\u2019s certainly the opportunity to do that in many other diseases. There\u2019s companies working on trying to cure sickle-cell disease, others working on other inherited disorders\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 so really reprogramming cells.</p>\n<p><strong>Jorge:</strong> So if you go back 10 years ago, something like a CAR-T therapy would\u2019ve seemed science fiction-y\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 or at least maybe 20 years ago. If we look <em>forward</em> 10 to 20 years, what are the modalities of the future, you think?</p>\n<p><strong>Vas:</strong> I think a couple things will likely come. I think xenotransplantation, which has been in and out and worked on \u2014 and what\u2019s interesting is every one of these comes up and down \u2014 so gene therapy, cell therapy popped up in the \u201990s; kind of went away; popped up in the 2000s, kind of went away. And then, the key lynchpin issues were solved, and then it was unlocked in xenotransplantation, where you were able to make organs for transplantation in animals, that enable them to have a sufficient number of transplantable organs for human beings. I think we\u2019re probably gonna get there in the next 10, 10 to years.</p>\n<p><strong>Sonal:</strong> Interesting.</p>\n<p><strong>Jorge:</strong> So regenerative medicine makes a real comeback?</p>\n<p><strong>Vas:</strong> I mean, well, I think another area \u2014 yes, xenotransplantation being one \u2014 I think the other area is we are gonna be able to start to solve problems of regenerating tissue. We already see examples where we in our own labs can start to crack, how can you regenerate cartilage, or how can you regenerate other tissues in the body? Which would, again, seem like science fiction. But I think actually harnessing the pathways to really get regeneration to happen, which would help healthy aging, is another thing I think will likely come. So there\u2019s a lot of things that are still on the way absolutely.</p>\n<p><strong>Jorge:</strong> Can you imagine a moment in time where aging becomes a therapeutic area for pharma companies?</p>\n<p><strong>Vas:</strong> You know, we had actually an aging program, a small aging program for some time where we were trying to work on things like sarcopenia, which is muscle wasting, and similar kinds of conditions. It turned out to be very, very difficult, because, again, multifactorial.</p>\n<p>And you probably need a medicine with behavior, with diet, with exercise, with all kinds of things to help healthy aging happen. But like I said, I mean we continue to focus on more of the pure regenerative parts. If you think about\u2013 the whole world of joints and movements has not really been addressed and cracked, and so this is an area where we have exploratory programs to see maybe we could find something. I mean, if you could regenerate cartilage, or tendons, or enable muscle strength incrementally, you might be able to improve healthy aging quite a bit.</p>\n<p><strong>Sonal:</strong> Fabulous. Why don\u2019t we actually shift into the innovative medicines set of therapies?</p>\n<p><strong>Vas:</strong> Another big area, hot area is in the world of RNAs. So these are really ways to deliver \u2014 let\u2019s call it, genetic instructions \u2014 into specific cells. This has been an area that\u2019s been worked on for many years. It\u2019s always been difficult, but I think companies are now starting to crack the problem of delivering RNAs into specific cells in a highly effective way.</p>\n<p><strong>Sonal:</strong> Can you give me just a concrete example of how that plays out with a real disease?</p>\n<p><strong>Vas:</strong> So there\u2019s a couple of really nice examples now with RNA interference, and one that our company is working on is RNA interference to impact a factor that\u2019s really a big part of heart disease: It\u2019s called \u00e2\u0080\u009cLp-little-a\u00e2\u0080\u009d. \u00e2\u0080\u009cLp(a)\u00e2\u0080\u009d is actually thought to be one of the remaining risk factors for heart disease that has not been addressed \u2014 everybody\u2019s of course addressed cholesterol extremely well, triglycerides \u2014 Lp(a) is another factor, but there\u2019s never been a medicine against it.</p>\n<p>And it\u2019s really hard to drug Lp(a). And so the only way to really target it turns out to be using RNA-based therapies. These RNA-based therapies are able to block the production of the gene \u2014 translation of the gene into the protein \u2014 and then actually reduce the Lp(a) in the blood. And so this is one example of how we\u2019re trying to take this [RNA-based therapies] into an area where otherwise you wouldn\u2019t necessarily have a therapeutic against something that could have a big impact for patients with prior heart conditions.</p>\n<p><strong>Jorge:</strong> So RNA interference is essentially a mute button for a gene of interest?</p>\n<p><strong>Vas:</strong> That\u2019s right, yeah.</p>\n<p><strong>Sonal:</strong> I love that, and that\u2019s a great example. And by the way, Lp(a) sounds like the name of a rapper. &lt;group laughs&gt;</p>\n<p>Just remind me really quickly: Obviously I know what I learned about RNA from biology class in the sense of proteins, but can you give us a little more about what\u2019s unique about RNA-based therapeutic modalities?</p>\n<blockquote class=\"pullquote pullquote--orange\"><p><strong><em>RNA interference is essentially a \u2018mute button\u2019 for a gene of interest.</em></strong></p></blockquote>\n<p><strong>Vas: </strong>Yah, absolutely. So when you think about the history of our industry, maybe another way to describe the trend I see that\u2019s happening is we used to be about chemicals \u2014 so small molecules. So for probably 100 years, most of the pharmaceutical companies had their basis in the chemicals industry. And so we made these small molecules that happened to have various effects on the body, and over 100 years we figured out we could really target what those chemicals do.</p>\n<p>Around the late 1980s we realized you could actually make large molecules \u2014 large proteins \u2014 and make them be therapeutic. So this is antibodies and recombinant proteins, and that led to a whole new renaissance in our industry. And over the next 20 years and up to today, probably [are] still the largest categories, so-called biologic medicines. These are antibodies and proteins.</p>\n<p>What I see happening <em>now</em> is a shift to a next set of modalities that move beyond small molecules and proteins, and that is now really touching other elements of what happens in a cell. So one is RNAse \u2014 which is really the way DNA gets translated into a protein and goes through an RNA \u2014 so that\u2019s one new modality.</p>\n<p>Another modality \u2014 both of them really are about editing DNA in different ways \u2014 one is to take the cells out of the body and edit the DNA of the cell or enable the cell to produce something different; the other is to do it inside the body, that\u2019s what we call gene therapy. So we make that distinction of \u00e2\u0080\u009ccell therapy\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009cgene therapy\u00e2\u0080\u009d.</p>\n<p><strong>Jorge:</strong> So cell therapy is ex vivo, gene therapy is in vivo?</p>\n<p><strong>Vas:</strong> Actually it\u2019d be in vivo.<strong>\u00c2\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Sonal:</strong> Right: inside, outside.</p>\n<p><strong>Vas:</strong> Inside, outside. So these are new ways of actually delivering medicines or creating medicines in the human body.</p>\n<p>And now you see early-stage companies doing even more radical things, trying to turn red blood cells into therapeutics, amongst other things. So it\u2019s really an expansion, if you think about it, of the game board of how you can address human diseases.</p>\n<p><strong>Jorge:</strong> I love, sort of, the sweeping history you have here in terms of starting with chemistry and then moving to large molecules, and then now moving more into the cell and gene-engineered world.</p>\n<p>Historically every single drug program has been a very bespoke thing\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 its own ground war, right? You have your target discovery, then you have your validation, and you have your lead, then you optimize that molecule, and so on and so on. And, my sense has always been that because it\u2019s so bespoke that there are some learnings that are generalizable in any given disease area but every program is a unique thing.</p>\n<p>When you start to move to the RNA world, to the cell world, to the gene world, is it gonna become much more of a modular world where the first version of a CAR-T is gonna be by definition less sophisticated than the second version, but the second version will be built off the first? And you go from being in a bespoke world to going much more into an iterative world.</p>\n<p><strong>Vas:</strong> Unfortunately, in our industry it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the answer is always that it depends. In the specific example of CAR-T, I do think that\u2019s what\u2019s gonna happen because you have such complex manufacturing that you\u2019re gonna have the first generation, let\u2019s say, of a CD-19 CAR-T, which is a CAR-T that targets P-cell cancers. And you\u2019re gonna try to then move into the next generation that hopefully has more rapid manufacturing, maybe higher efficacy, and then even more rapid manufacturing. So you\u2019re gonna get into that iteration.</p>\n<p>Now it\u2019s not like medical device iteration. I mean, this is still gonna take years to do, but you are gonna get to that iteration.</p>\n<p>I think another way \u2014 what I see happening though with these new technologies \u2014 is real platforms insofar as once you have the backbone of the production, and even the go-to-market model depending, you can put multiple products onto the platform. What we have done at our company is build a global network of manufacturing sites that can take cells out of human beings, and reprogram the cells, and put them back in the body. And we\u2019ve built the links into hospitals to enable us to do that. So you have that as a capability. You also have the capability to understand how to use what\u2019s called a \u00e2\u0080\u009clentivirus\u00e2\u0080\u009d to reprogram a cell. So we\u2019ve got all of that.</p>\n<p>Now, we can apply that in very different ways \u2014 in cancer, in sickle-cell disease, in inherited disorders \u2014 and use that same infrastructure to actually then keep pushing the medicines through. That\u2019s very different than what we\u2019ve had to do in the past, where every single medicine had a bespoke production process \u2014 it had to have its own manufacturing facility \u00e2\u0080\u0093 now, we can actually build that platform and then layer medicines on. It\u2019s no different in gene therapies when you think about AAV vectors (these are ways to deliver these gene therapies into the body): Once you solve the process, let\u2019s say, for one of these vectors, you can apply it to multiple different diseases and not have to recreate everything again.</p>\n<p>That\u2019s a shift I see in how our industry operates.</p>\n<p><strong>Sonal:</strong> You know, I find that fascinating because it actually sounds a lot like what we talk a lot about, <a href=\"https://a16z.com/tag/engineering-science/\">this theme</a> around \u00e2\u0080\u009cengineering biology\u00e2\u0080\u009d, and when you <a href=\"https://a16z.com/2018/11/12/how-to-engineer-biology/\">bring engineering principles and mindsets to biology</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Vijay:</strong> Yah, you just mentioned multiple places where the repeatability, and different aspects of engineering have already come in. How is this trend gonna continue, where is gonna be the new places where engineering can play a role?</p>\n<p><strong>Vas:</strong> Yah I think the easiest place is gonna be in continuing to innovate on the processes by which we really manipulate cells, and genes, and really get to the next wave of manufacturing. \u00e2\u0080\u0098Cause I would say we\u2019re really on the only learning-to-crawl [phase] with respect to most of these technologies and how we produce them; pretty rudimentary.</p>\n<p>And so I think there\u2019s gonna be an engineering problem of how do you handle cells, and how do you handle the vectors, and make this a much, much more efficient process? And there\u2019s a lot of very smart engineering firms now working on that space. So I think that\u2019s one place.</p>\n<p>An area I\u2019m quite interested in is how we can get much smarter at actually engineering the medicines themselves?</p>\n<p><strong>Vijay:</strong> Yah.</p>\n<p><strong>Vas:</strong> I mean, we spend a lot of work investing in AI and 3-D visualizations to say, In a so-called world of chemical biology, or if you even think about using quantum chemistry to really understand how to define your monoclonal antibody, how can we do a lot more engineering of medicines up front?</p>\n<p>Because we really come from a heritage where everything was just trial and error. We just tried many, many, many molecules until we found one that worked and then we just took it forward. How can we become much smarter about that? And so in our research lab they\u2019re spending a lot of time thinking about, How do we engineer the medicine up front to do what we want it to do? And that\u2019s a whole new world, I think.</p>\n<p><strong>Vijay:</strong> Yeah. Also, there\u2019s presumably gonna have to be a culture that shifts along with this. I read Alan Greenspan\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/549448/capitalism-in-america-by-alan-greenspan-and-adrian-wooldridge/9780735222441/\">book</a> on the history of capitalism, and he talked about how in Europe, furniture was bespoke, and you\u2019d make this beautiful chair, and it\u2019s this handicraft. And they actually hated the idea of factories in engineering because it takes the art out of it.</p>\n<p><strong>Sonal:</strong> Not \u00e2\u0080\u009cartisanal\u00e2\u0080\u009d anymore.</p>\n<p><strong>Vijay:</strong> Yah, it\u2019s not artisanal anymore. But I think once you shift towards that mindset where you have reproducability and almost a factory-like process, that can be built.</p>\n<p>Once you can have that shift, as long as everyone is ready to make that shift, then things can really start rolling. But there has to be a major shift. And it turns out, in America people really didn\u2019t care about that artisanal part as much and we got factories, and that was a huge part of the early, like, late 1800s. And I\u2019m curious \u2014 you spoke so much about how Novartis is changing \u2014 and so presumably, there\u2019s an internal cultural change as well?</p>\n<p><strong>Vas:</strong> Yah. We\u2019re trying to make a quantum change, I think, in our culture. What we have is \u2014 as context, I believe we\u2019ve moved to become truly just a knowledge organization; vI mean, so much of the rudimentary tasks have been either automated or sent to third parties.</p>\n<p>So we have a whole organization of knowledge workers, 50% of them are millennials, and they wanna work in a very different environment than, let\u2019s say, an industrial company 20 years ago. And so we call our new culture \u00e2\u0080\u009cinspired, curious, and unbossed\u00e2\u0080\u009d, and we want our people to feel inspired by the work; really curious about the outside world; and not live in a bossed company, but really lived in an unbossed, much more empowered, company.</p>\n<p>And when we talk about areas like digital and data science cell and gene therapies, it\u2019s so critical because these are so complex areas. You need your people to figure out the answers, and we can\u2019t be in a world where everybody\u2019s waiting for management to tell everybody what to do, because none of us know what to do either. Because these are whole new spaces for us.</p>\n<p>So that\u2019s a big shift. The other element of that journey is to get a lot more comfortable with rapid failure. I mean, we have a much more rapid cycle. We can\u2019t expect that we\u2019re gonna sort it all out and it\u2019s all gonna work perfectly because the first thing we\u2019ve learned already in cell and gene therapy is nothing works the way you expect it to work, right?</p>\n<p><strong>Vijay:</strong> Yeah. And so you built a platform for rapid iteration.</p>\n<p><strong>Vas:</strong> That\u2019s the idea, yeah.</p>\n<p><strong>Sonal:</strong> What I love about that, it reminds me of computing and software companies and the shift from waterfall, to like <a href=\"https://a16z.com/2018/03/28/devops-org-change-software-performance/\">more devops</a>, agile;</p>\n<p><strong>Vas:</strong> Yah, the same principle. We\u2019re a little late to the party, but yeah, that\u2019s the idea.</p>\n<p><strong>Sonal:</strong> Even microservices-architecture enabled\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Yah, it\u2019s the same kind of principle. That\u2019s fascinating.</p>\n<p>So, we haven\u2019t talked about the big elephants \u2014 in a good way! \u2014 in the room: of AI and ML, you know, artificial intelligence and machine learning. Let\u2019s talk about AI, and ML, <a href=\"https://a16z.com/2017/12/05/data-science-ai-practice/\">and data</a>. I mean, it\u2019s not a question of if or when, it\u2019s how.</p>\n<p>The question I have \u2014 because quite frankly it\u2019s a very hyped topic, too, and people promise all kinds of things when they talk about applying AI and ML <a href=\"https://a16z.com/2017/11/03/ai-medicine/\">to medicine</a> \u2014 I\u2019m very curious for your take, as the head of Novartis: Where do you see the strongest applications of AI and ML?</p>\n<p><strong>Vas:</strong> Well, I have to first say I completely agree about the hype cycle here. I mean as we\u2019ve gotten quite scaled and working on digital health and data science, we\u2019ve learned that there\u2019s a lot of talk and very little in terms of actual delivery of impact.</p>\n<p>But we\u2019ve learned a lot. I think that the first thing we\u2019ve learned, is the importance of having outstanding data to actually base your ML on. In our own hands, in our own shop, we\u2019ve been working on a few big projects. And we\u2019ve had to spend most of the time just cleaning the data sets before you can even run the algorithms. That\u2019s taken us years just to clean the data sets, and I think people underestimate how little clean data there is out there and how hard it is to clean and link the\u2013</p>\n<p><strong>Vijay:</strong> It was never intended to have this type of analysis done, right? It was intended for a given project and that was it.</p>\n<p><strong>Vas:</strong> Right, yeah, that\u2019s, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been so much of it. And then the other thing is there are patterns that can be really learned from it.</p>\n<p>I mean, do you have a good training data set to actually train the algorithms? So there\u2019s a few places I think we\u2019ve seen a lot of traction. One, I think the vision or image problem has been very well, well solved. So right now we\u2019re in the process of digitizing all of our pathology images and having AI just be able to scan all of the pathology images\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 at Novartis.</p>\n<p><strong>Vijay:</strong> That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s great.</p>\n<p><strong>Vas:</strong> And we have millions of, of course records of biopsies and tissue, so that\u2019s a huge project we have called PathAI; really work on that as a single example.</p>\n<p><strong>Sonal:</strong> I mean, that\u2019s, like, a goldmine.</p>\n<p><strong>Vas: </strong>It should be.</p>\n<p>And if you then apply that as well to the vast storage of imaging data we have from our clinical trials, we have 2 million patients in clinical trials at least in the last 10 years. And we have MRIs, CT scans, retinal scans, heart scans, and all of that as well. I think ML can have at least a significant potential to really find hopefully new insights. So I think the vision/image problem has been one we\u2019ve been able to really take on.</p>\n<p>Another area is in our operations. So we built an operational command center. It took us, as I said, two and a half years to build it. We call it Sense, and what it enables us \u2014 a team sitting centrally in our headquarters \u2014 to do is look at all of our clinical trials in the world, and AI is predicting which trials are gonna enroll on time or not enroll on time; predict which ones are gonna have quality issues or not quality issues. And the reason we could do that is we had 10 years of history to train the algorithms.</p>\n<p>And we run about 400-500 clinical trials a year, so we have a lot of data that we could train the algorithms.</p>\n<p><strong>Jorge:</strong> Does that mean you had to dig all the way back into automating real-time information on clinical trials? So the data entry on a clinical trial as a patient is enrolling, has that all been automated as well? Because that used to be done on pads.</p>\n<p><strong>Vas:</strong> It\u2019s a great question. Really what we focus on is the operational data, so one level up from the patient: Is the trial enrolling on time? Are the sites open? All of those elements. On the operational side, it was really easier to do this than trying to get all the way down to the patient-level data.</p>\n<p>The other area interestingly in the financial area as well, we find that AI does a great job of predicting our free cash flow, predicting a lot of our sales for key products, and it does better than our internal people because it doesn\u2019t have the biases and the data is very clean. And we\u2019ve got very long-term data. So that\u2019s been all positive. But there have been other areas where I think it\u2019s just simply not met up.</p>\n<p>I mean, I think the Holy Grail of having unstructured machine learning, go into big clinical data lakes, and then suddenly find new insights \u2014 we\u2019ve not been able to crack. Mostly because the data, to link it up, we are spending a lot of our energy just trying to get all of our data harmonized so that some algorithm could maybe find anything of use.</p>\n<p><strong>Jorge:</strong> An area that\u2019s desperately in need of innovation is how we think about clinical trials, recognizing we have to operate within the system that we live in.</p>\n<p>But if you could design testing safety and efficacy in humans on a blank sheet of paper, what would look different from a clinical trial perspective \u2014 versus where we are today and the way we do it now?</p>\n<p><strong>Vas:</strong> The ideal world, if we could get there, would be to have integrated health records where we could easily insert the fields that we needed for clinical trials and then we could use something like a blockchain (or some other distributed architecture) that enabled patients to consent for us then to access the data, and then, you know run the trials through that. And that would eliminate so much of the effort of creating a second database versus the EHR, monitoring that database, QAing that database, locking that database. You could get the data on an ongoing basis. I mean, it would radically simplify this. I believe that\u2019s a huge, huge opportunity.</p>\n<p>I think we have a long way to go, as you know, because EHRs are not where they need to be; we\u2019re probably not where we need to be to get there. But I see opportunities in baby steps to actually get towards that, and we\u2019re experimenting with that, and other companies are as well.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"pullquote pullquote--orange\"><p><strong><em>I think we have a long way to go, as you know, because EHRs are not where they need to be.</em></strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>The other thing people talk about \u00e2\u0080\u0093 but I\u2019ll take a skeptical voice around it \u2014 is the ability to use real-world evidence to try to get at these things. But as somebody who\u2019s worked in clinical trials for most of their time in the industry I do believe that the power of randomization, the power of blindedness, is what enables us to control for all of the things we don\u2019t know about the complexity of human life and human biology. And to think that we\u2019re gonna take that away and then be able to really determine the efficacy of a medicine puts a lot on the statistics that I don\u2019t think we have.</p>\n<p>And so I\u2019m more of a real-world evidence \u2014 I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a skeptic, but realist \u2014 who says, after we have randomized placebo-controlled data that really tells us that something has the effect we think it is, then to explore more effects or explore more uses through real-world evidence makes a lot of sense. But I don\u2019t see this as a panacea that suddenly will make the world much, much easier.</p>\n<p><strong>Vijay:</strong> I mean, that\u2019s my expectation as well, is you\u2019ll see it first come out as, like, a phase four. Something where you\u2019re using real-world evidence, which right now is used for reimbursement anyways, and so on. But then maybe see how far it can go back\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 but it\u2019s not gonna replace it.</p>\n<p><strong>Sonal:</strong> You guys don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think \u2014 I mean, not to sound na\u00c3\u00afve \u2014 but you don\u2019t think a secular shift, like, <a href=\"https://a16z.com/tag/sensors-everywhere-and/\">sensorification of everything</a>, and everyone really truly has <a href=\"https://a16z.com/2017/05/08/wearables-quantifiedself-biohacking/\">continuous wearables</a>, like everyone\u2019s wearing a CGM [continuous glucous monitor] by default\u2026? I mean, I hear you on the statistical side, there\u2019s a lot of other spurious variables and things introduced into that equation. But it\u2019s a very huge, very deep, nuanced, patient-level set of data; seems like we can\u2019t ignore the power of that. Where do you fall on that?</p>\n<p><strong>Vas:</strong> First of all, I would say just in general, sensors is another place where there\u2019s been a lot of hype of expectations. I mean, we\u2019ve been really trying to explore the use of sensors in clinical trials now for (in my own experience) at least six years.</p>\n<p>And it\u2019s been tough to get sensors that really meet the clinical-trial grade outcomes. I mean, they really show that they can be validated versus our current clinical end points. Now as consumer products, fine. I mean, perfect.</p>\n<p><strong>Sonal:</strong> Yes, right, but you\u2019re talking medical grade.</p>\n<p><strong>Vas:</strong> But here we need to really be able to replace pretty rigorous tests, and we haven\u2019t seen that yet. Now we\u2019re exploring the use of many different sensors, and the real power of it is a continuous variable to actually see how a patient\u2019s doing in between.</p>\n<p><strong>Sonal:</strong> Like a longitudinal study.</p>\n<p><strong>Vas:</strong> Between the study visits. And so I think that will help a lot. But I still think in the end you\u2019re gonna need to randomize and blind. I mean, if you don\u2019t randomize it\u2019s really hard to figure out what is going on in a complex system.</p>\n<p><strong>Vijay:</strong> I agree with\u2013 short term. I think longer term\u2026my gut feeling is that this is a solvable problem statistically, because there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s even issues with clinical trial design that one has to overcome today because randomization isn\u2019t just picking people literally randomly necessarily.</p>\n<p><strong>Vas:</strong> True.</p>\n<p><strong>Sonal:</strong> It\u2019s a sample, not a population\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Yes, I agree, small \u00e2\u0080\u009cn\u00e2\u0080\u009d, not capital \u00e2\u0080\u009cN\u00e2\u0080\u009d.</p>\n<p><strong>Vijay:</strong> And there\u2019s been a lot of work on causality theory in statistics. So there are advances\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 but I think it\u2019s not there now.</p>\n<p><strong>Sonal:</strong> More to say there? That was really interesting.</p>\n<p><strong>Vijay:</strong> What\u2019s the role of bringing innovation in from the outside through partnerships and M&amp;A, in ML?</p>\n<p><strong>Vas:</strong> One of the things we\u2019re working through is how do we get the talent, you know?</p>\n<p><strong>Vijay:</strong> Yah.</p>\n<p><strong>Vas:</strong> As we really start to organize the data \u2014 and we\u2019ve brought in some really great talent to really help us work on data architecture \u2014 and come up with a whole data landscape for the company, we\u2019re always now thinking about, How do we treat data as an asset? That\u2019s one of the things we keep harping on, is that data is an asset. Whatever data we collect from the external world has to be organized in a clear data architecture.</p>\n<p>But then to take the next step to get the data scientist \u2014 to really find the insights \u2014 we\u2019re not the traditional place for data scientists &lt; coming out of Stanford who\u2019s looking for where they wanna come\u2026</p>\n<p><strong>Vijay:</strong> That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s right\u00e2\u0080\u00a6</p>\n<p><strong>Vas:</strong> So we\u2019re working through partnerships with universities, potential partnerships with startups; actually here in the Bay Area we have a center called Biome, where we\u2019re working with different startups. And so these are the things we\u2019re trying to do to engage and hopefully create an ecosystem that helps us do this, and not just do it ourselves. Because I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll be able to attract the scale that you would need.</p>\n<p><strong>Vijay:</strong> This is a Reese\u2019s Peanut Butter Cup issue because startups sometimes have some innovation on the data science, but not the data. &lt;Vas: yup&gt; And so bringing the two together, I think, seems like a very natural combination.</p>\n<p><strong>Sonal:</strong> Where does the Reese\u2019s Peanut Butter Cup bit come in?</p>\n<p><strong>Vijay:</strong> Oh, peanut butter and chocolate. Like, he\u2019s got the peanut butter and they have chocolate.</p>\n<p><strong>Sonal:</strong> I don\u2019t eat Reese\u2019s Pieces.</p>\n<p><strong>Jorge:</strong> You don\u2019t remember those commercials?</p>\n<p><strong>Sonal:</strong> I don\u2019t remember them.</p>\n<p><strong>Jorge:</strong> Oh my God. &lt;chuckles&gt;</p>\n<p><strong>Sonal:</strong> I watched a lot of TV when I was growing up but I don\u2019t remember that;)</p>\n<p>I find it fascinating \u2014 because a lot of our bio entrepreneurs/ companies, the #1 thing that they tell me, [is] that drawing data scientists is one of the hardest challenges they have to face. And so you\u2019re saying with the Biome and other things you\u2019re doing that you have to kinda <em>create</em> the pipeline, not just <em>source</em> it?</p>\n<p><strong>Vas:</strong> That\u2019s right.</p>\n<p>And to your earlier point, the opportunity is to say, \u201cLook, come and work with us and we\u2019ll let you work with our data, and you can learn and we\u2019ll learn, and maybe then there\u2019s a partnership that\u2019s created, or maybe you wanna come work for us, which actually would be great.\u201d But that\u2019s how we\u2019re approaching it.</p>\n<p><strong>Vijay:</strong> Well, and here\u2019s actually an interesting shift that can happen in academia. You know, with my group at Stanford, many people actually during their PhD have gone to work in pharma. And it\u2019s impossible to pull the data <em>out</em> of pharma, but it\u2019s actually easier to put the grad student <em>into</em> pharma.</p>\n<p><strong>Vas:</strong> Into pharma for sure.</p>\n<p><strong>Vijay:</strong> And so the grad student comes with the code, runs it on, internal through the firewall of pharma and we see how it does. And you can still publish papers \u2014 where maybe you have to obscure what the target is, or something like that \u2014 but you can at least see how things are going. And there\u2019s nothing like trying it in the real world.</p>\n<p><strong>Vas:</strong> Yeah, makes total sense.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"pullquote pullquote--orange\"><p><em><strong>If I\u2019m an entrepreneur, you\u2019re an elephant and I\u2019m a mouse, and if I have to dance, I have to hope you\u2019re a very graceful elephant because otherwise you\u2019re gonna crush me.</strong></em></p></blockquote>\n<p><strong>Jorge:</strong> So on this question of bringing in talent, you guys operate globally. Obviously you\u2019re in\u2026 150 countries? You\u2019re headquartered in Switzerland; in the Boston, Cambridge area; you have a presence out here in Silicon Valley.</p>\n<p>So how do you guys think about <a href=\"https://a16z.com/category/innovation-clusters/\">innovation hubs</a>? Very simplistically, is all of the machine learning, artificial intelligence talent gonna be based out here? How do you distribute teams across the world?</p>\n<p><strong>Vas:</strong> So, it\u2019s interesting, when you look at research, we have three main hubs \u2014 our three main hubs are in: Cambridge, in Basel, Switzerland, and in Shanghai in China \u2014 those are our three main research hubs.</p>\n<p>In terms of development centers for product development you would add onto that list Hyderabad, India as well as Maine, and East Hanover, New Jersey.</p>\n<p>But when it comes to data science and digital what we\u2019ve actually decided to do is to take a much more distributed approach. So we\u2019re building up these Biome centers in San Francisco, in London, in other locations in the Middle East, perhaps in China, just trying to say, We\u2019re not gonna constrain ourselves with our current locations.</p>\n<p>We\u2019re gonna just try to source talent wherever it is \u2014 particularly because talent in these areas doesn\u2019t necessarily have to be housed next to the other functions. We\u2019re really asking these people to explore our data and find big new insights. So that\u2019s the approach we\u2019re taking right now\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 is really saying, you know, let\u2019s go where the talent is, as opposed to force everyone to come to us. So we\u2019ll see; that\u2019s the experiment we\u2019re undertaking.</p>\n<p><strong>Sonal:</strong> How do you see the future of that working out? Like, do you see that Boston, Silicon Valley, Basel, these places will specialize? Will they distribute?</p>\n<p><strong>Vas:</strong> We have lots of debates. If we were to build a scaled hub in digital or in data science health, where would we go? I think one of the challenges in the Bay Area is, again, just the competition for talent is so intense, especially in the tech sector.</p>\n<p><strong>Jorge:</strong> So we\u2019re in the business of funding early-stage companies, supporting entrepreneurs. If I\u2019m an entrepreneur, I obviously see a ton of benefit partnering with Novartis: access to data that doesn\u2019t exist elsewhere, obviously validation in my approach in my technology, etc.</p>\n<p>But if I\u2019m an entrepreneur, I\u2019m also scared to approach a large company like a Novartis because I\u2019d worry about \u2014 basically you\u2019re an elephant and I\u2019m a mouse, and if I have to dance, I have to hope you\u2019re a very graceful elephant &lt;laughs&gt; because otherwise you\u2019re gonna crush me.</p>\n<p>What advice would you give to entrepreneurs about approaching biopharma, large biopharma, in the spirit of collaboration?</p>\n<p><strong>Vas:</strong> Yeah, in data and digital what we\u2019ve tried to do is make us feel a lot smaller, because we recognize that we are a huge beast. And so with things like the Biome, we work with StartUp Health. We work with many other entities to try to say, \u201cHow can we make ourselves feel small, or work in smaller units?\u201d We created our own digital data organization so that entrepreneurs would have an input into Novartis, where it\u2019s people like them. The people on that team are all come from the tech sector: They\u2019re working in a much smaller, agile way; they do sprints and scrums; and they work in all the ways that people are used to working. And I would say really engaging through some place in a large company that I think has a natural affiliation for the entrepreneur makes a lot of sense.</p>\n<p>It is harder on the traditional biomedical side, right? If you just think of us, we have 17,000 R&amp;D people and spend $9B+ a year in R&amp;D. So if you\u2019re a small entrepreneur who wants to start working with us, it\u2019s easy to get lost in the fray. We\u2019re trying to work on that. Most of the companies in our industry try to have external offices that try to engage. We have an External Scholars Program where we really try to enable scientists to use our facilities, interact with our scientists. So we\u2019re trying to experiment but I can\u2019t say we\u2019ve completely figured that out on the biomedical side. I\u2019m much more optimistic on the data and digital science side. Mostly because we just brought people in from that world\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 and they just think differently.</p>\n<p><strong>Sonal:</strong> There was something I wanted to ask you earlier which was about measurement.</p>\n<p>Because when you talked about the portfolio approach, I wanted to know how you think about actually measuring the way you make those investments in a portfolio. And the reason I ask is because there\u2019s all these mindsets: Pasteur\u2019s Quadrant, like, here\u2019s a place where we\u2019re gonna put more emphasis on basic research, and we\u2019re gonna put more emphasis on something practical; or, there\u2019s another approach, at Xerox PARC <a href=\"https://www.mixprize.org/story/innovation-as-business\">they used</a> a modified real options analysis as a way to figure out how to do short-term, long-term, mid-term type investments.</p>\n<p>Do you have a way of closing the feedback loop for how you measure the success of how you\u2019re allocating and deploying investments in R&amp;D?</p>\n<p><strong>Vas:</strong> Yeah, I mean, we have financial measures, so we look at return on capital employed, MPV, MPV peak sales, all the traditional financial measures.</p>\n<p>We look at really the scientific \u00e2\u0080\u009cinnovativeness\u00e2\u0080\u009d, for lack of a better word \u2014 is this really something that\u2019s changing the game from a scientific standpoint? \u2014 that\u2019s a little bit more of a subjective measure, but we try to ask teams, is this really moving the needle from a standard of care, science? And we actually score that based on six different parameters that we make.</p>\n<p><strong>Sonal:</strong> Oh, interesting. Are you allowed to share the parameters?</p>\n<p><strong>Vas:</strong> I don\u2019t know them off the top of my head. But, you know, we really try to score the medicines to say, Is this really transformative? So you have a financial score, you have a transformational score.</p>\n<p>And then another kind of a subjective element is, does this strategically fit; so is it in one of our core therapeutic areas? So if somebody comes with a great breakthrough \u2014 which happens not quite often in an area that we\u2019re <em>not</em> in \u2014 that\u2019s the toughest one, because it\u2019s a big breakthrough but we\u2019re not in this space. And what do we do now? Do we really wanna build this up, or do we wanna just send it out to license, to a fund, or do something else?</p>\n<p>Those are tough discussions, but we try to be disciplined because it\u2019s, again, the patience in being really sure you build depth in your key areas. Because if you take another program on that means that there\u2019s another program you have to stop. It\u2019s a zero-sum game for us.</p>\n<p><strong>Sonal:</strong> Yes, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an opportunity cost.</p>\n<p><strong>Jorge:</strong> Well, one thing that\u2019s funny, just listening to you talk about \u2014 and Sonal brought up this question of Not Invented Here syndrome \u2014 and when you contrast that with managing, having an organization that is naturally curious and unbossed, as you said.</p>\n<p><strong>Sonal:</strong> Inspired.</p>\n<p><strong>Jorge:</strong> Inspired. But managing that Not Invented Here syndrome, versus, maintaining the skepticism that things might be in a hype cycle and not chasing hype \u2014 it\u2019s a very fine balance, right?</p>\n<p><strong>Vas:</strong> It is.</p>\n<p><strong>Jorge:</strong> It\u2019s kind of like the not-invented-here, the <a href=\"https://a16z.com/2019/03/24/loonshots-moonshots-incentives-org-innovation-big-small-phase-transitions/\">other side of that coin</a> is <em>not invented yet</em>.</p>\n<p><strong>Vas:</strong> Yes.</p>\n<p><strong>Jorge:</strong> And you gotta figure out where you are in that. And I think that is one of the most difficult things that an innovative company at the scale of which Novartis operates has to always find that balance. Between.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"pullquote pullquote--orange\"><p><em><strong>The other side of not-invented-here is not invented </strong></em><strong>yet</strong><em><strong>.</strong></em></p></blockquote>\n<p><strong>Vas:</strong> Absolutely. I mean, it is a balancing act between the different forces. I find a lot of it comes down to just encouraging people just to have open, frank debate. And be comfortable with task conflict without personal conflict. That\u2019s what I keep telling our team: We have to be incredibly curious about one another, what one another thinks. I think that\u2019s just all about trying to get the best ideas, and we\u2019re just trying to debate, and\u2013 but it\u2019s never personal. Because I think particularly in the world of science it often becomes personal. You know it becomes, This is about me and my science versus you not believing in my science, as opposed to saying, We need to just find a great medicine, or we need to just solve this problem. That\u2019s a journey I think we\u2019re taking the organization on. But I think that\u2019s gonna be what\u2019s really critical is having that radical transparency and the open debate.</p>\n<p><strong>Sonal:</strong> I find it fascinating because it alludes to the concepts around skin in the game. Because you want people to have skin in the game, but at the same time they need to have just enough <em>out</em> [of the game] that they can see things a little clearly where you\u2019re not only attacking their sacred cows.</p>\n<p><strong>Jorge:</strong> Skin in the game, but not vital organs.</p>\n<p><strong>Sonal:</strong> Yah exactly that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a great way of putting that; I love that.</p>\n<p><strong>Jorge:</strong> How long have you been in the CEO chair now?</p>\n<p><strong>Vas:</strong> Ah, one year.</p>\n<p><strong>Jorge:</strong> What\u2019s the \u2014 you know, having come up through the R&amp;D side of the organization \u2014 what\u2019s been the most surprising thing to you now as the CEO, given that R&amp;D is such a big part of what the company does?</p>\n<p><strong>Vas:</strong> I am just amazed by how vast our company is. I mean, even though I\u2019ve been at the company since 2005, now actually overseeing a company that\u2019s 120,000 people in 150 countries, you go anywhere and we are just a vast, vast company. So that\u2019s one thing that\u2019s really surprised me just to have to now \u2014 when you think about making a transformation happen and you try to make that happen in such a large enterprise \u2014 that certainly\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 I mean, that really hits you.</p>\n<p>I think the other thing about this job is crisis management, which you\u2019re just not exposed to. This job is a lot about managing crises, and that\u2019s been a big learning curve for me. Because in the world of R&amp;D we had clinical trials that last two or three years: everything\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sort of predictable, and we sort of know the decisions we need to make; a lot of documentation that you can lean on. Now you\u2019re in the world of the ambiguous, the uncertain, and then things hit you completely from the blind side and you gotta keep moving ahead.</p>\n<p><strong>Sonal:</strong> If you were to write a letter to grad students, or just people kinda entering the space, what kind of skills would you encourage them to have? Like if you could have added things 20 years ago, what would you tell them to do?</p>\n<p><strong>Vas:</strong> I\u2019d say focus a lot on how you lead people. I think there\u2019s so much of a focus on technical expertise and thinking that that\u2019s gonna get you there \u2014 it matters, of course, competence matters tremendously \u2014 but what really makes the difference is how you lead people, how you lead yourself. I think investing more in that would pay off a lot.</p>\n<p>The other thing I\u2019d say is don\u2019t underestimate the importance of getting multidisciplinary exposure. Most people get worried when they have to make those jumps. I\u2019ve had a career at Novartis where I\u2019ve worked in commercial areas and marketing areas \u2014 so most of my time in R&amp;D worked across four different areas of the business \u2014 and so with that diversity of experiences it enables you to take the right decisions.</p>\n<p>There was one other point I wanted to raise: I think that what\u2019s often lost on people, because you mentioned the [medical] miracles, right? &lt;Vijay: Oh yah&gt; How incredible it is that we find any human medicine <em>at all</em>, because if you think about it, every human being is probably 40 trillion cells that are working together.</p>\n<p><strong>Vijay:</strong> It\u2019s amazing anything even works.</p>\n<p><strong>Vas:</strong> It\u2019s amazing \u2014 but we understand a fraction of the proteins, what they do \u2014 1,200 druggable proteins, but there\u2019s only a fraction of those that we can actually drug. We don\u2019t know what most of RNA does, non-coding RNA. We don\u2019t know most of what the genome\u2019s even talking about. And if you look at it, since the creation of the FDA, there\u2019s only been about 1,500 new molecular entities ever found. &lt;SC: wowww&gt; And most of those are actually overlapping in similar therapeutic areas.</p>\n<p>So actually if you were to count for \u2014 I haven\u2019t done the analysis, but if you count for double counts \u2014 my guess is it\u2019s in the hundreds of medicines that we\u2019ve actually found\u00e2\u0080\u00a6</p>\n<p><strong>Sonal:</strong> \u00e2\u0080\u00a6And by the way, what\u2019s the predominant therapeutic area?</p>\n<p><strong>Vas:</strong> Probably, I would guess hypertension cardiovascular disease but I have not looked carefully. But it\u2019s worth reflecting on how hard it is to do what we do, and when we find\u2013 I tell our people, \u201cYou have to think every medicine we find is a miracle that fits in the, the palm of your hand.\u201d</p>\n<p>We\u2019ve unlocked, in a sense, a billion years of evolution of the eukaryotic cell and human biology, and somehow we found something that was able to move the needle in this incredibly complex system. I think that\u2019s easy to forget when we just overly simplify what we do.</p>\n<p><strong>Sonal:</strong> That\u2019s a great note to end on. Vas, thank you for joining the a16z Podcast.</p>\n<p><strong>Vas:</strong> Thank you.</p>\n<p><strong>Jorge:</strong> Thanks so much.</p>\n<p><strong>Vijay:</strong> Yes, thank you.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"pullquote pullquote--orange\"><p><em><strong>How incredible it is that we find any human medicine at all!

But first, we opened our panel discussion with a presentation from a16z consumer partner, Katia Ameri, on what you need to know about the LA scene and why we think it\u2019s worth paying attention to in the years to come.\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<h3><strong>Transcript</strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Katia Ameri:</strong> Welcome, everyone to \u201cTime to Build Los Angeles.\u201d I\u2019m Katia Ameri. I am a partner on the consumer investing team at a16z. I think most of you probably know me as the one that sends you a bunch of LA Tech Week emails. You\u2019re welcome. We are super excited to have you here today. We have a really incredible agenda where we\u2019re going to talk about the innovation that\u2019s happening here in LA and also what\u2019s catapulting LA into a top tech hub. And before we get started with our first session, I\u2019m going to take a minute and walk you all through: why LA So, I think we\u2019ve all seen tech meets entertainment conferences in L.A. for the past decade. I can tell you that today, you are here to see something a little bit different. LA has a long history of winners. We have a diverse set of established companies across industries represented here from consumer to aerospace, to health tech and more.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">And while the LA ecosystem has historically been strong, in the past two years, in particular, the ecosystem has grown significantly as well. LA is the fastest growing of the top three tech hubs outpacing San Francisco and New York, and is far ahead of emerging ecosystems, like Miami and Austin. And the number of investments in capital flowing to LA has only continued to increase. And at a16z, we felt this inflection firsthand as we\u2019ve done more investments in the last two years in LA than we had done the six years prior combined. Right now, we have about 40 active portfolio companies in LA across seed, series A, and later stages. And we might not be the first people to the party. But in the last two years, we put a ton of skin in the game and we\u2019ve had a chance to work with many of you in this room.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">LA has gone through a number of inflections in the past. And looking at what\u2019s driving the most recent change, it\u2019s really due to the growing talent in the ecosystem. We have founders of unicorn companies that have built and scaled businesses moving to LA and injecting the ecosystem with knowledge. The startup scene is also up-leveling in the form of hacker houses like Launch House and founders of early stage companies are also moving to LA to start their businesses as well. And it\u2019s really this kind of new wave of talent that\u2019s cross-pollinating with the existing ecosystem that\u2019s really supercharging the growth.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">So, question of the day, why LA Tech Week? The goal of Tech Week has been to create community, specifically amongst the recent transplants that have moved here in the past two years, in addition to the community at large. Two, the goal of Tech Week is to attract talent and to leverage Tech Week as this mechanism for attracting new founders, builders, and engineers to LA. And ultimately, the goal is to broadcast the action. LA has been quiet, but LA has been building. And the goal of Tech Week is really to put the spotlight on LA tech and to showcase how rich this ecosystem really is. So leading up to Tech Week, we surveyed about 450 attendees to better understand the ecosystem, to actually put numbers behind what we were seeing, and here\u2019s what we heard from you.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">So, it\u2019s no surprise that looking at who\u2019s in the room, the top two industries represented here are media and consumer. But that makes up less than 30% of the pie, which means that 70% of you come from industries across fintech, crypto, enterprise, health tech, gaming, aerospace, and more. And looking at how long we\u2019ve been here, about half of you are newbies and have lived here for less than five years, about 16% of you have lived here for only less than one year, and about 10% of you are just visiting, and, hopefully, this week convinces you to stay. And what\u2019s particularly exciting is that L.A. is sticky. Even though we have a ton of new blood, most people don\u2019t have any plans to leave for the foreseeable future. And so when we asked why LA, this was the word cloud that we generated from your responses. And as you can see, kind of overwhelmingly, diversity and culture show up prominently in the answers. Diversity is very much in the DNA, diversity of people, diversity of industries, diversity of values. And culture is created and disseminated here. And so proximity to media and entertainment is one of the draws.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">And when we ask people, why not LA, when you remove answers like cost of living, it\u2019s really the fragmented nature of the city that really stood out and prevents people from finding community. Hopefully, today is the start of bringing people together more often. In today\u2019s remote world, you can build anywhere. What makes LA special is that you have a rich ecosystem of seasoned operators that make LA not just a city where you can build, but a city where you can scale. And so as promised, today, you are not here to see a Tech Meets Entertainment conference, but rather a Tech Meets LA conference, which means you are about to hear from many founders across the diverse range of industries that we\u2019ve talked about today. So, without further ado, it\u2019s time to build Los Angeles.\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> I\u2019m very excited to introduce our first session on investing in LA. Please, welcome Andrew Chen from a16z, Turner Novak of Banana Capital, Minnie Ingersoll of TenOneTen Ventures, and Michelle Kung, our venture editorial lead at a16z.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Michelle Kung:</strong> So, welcome, everyone, to our investing in L.A. panel. I\u2019m sure most of you guys are familiar with the people we have here on stage. But I figured we would start with some quick introductions, and maybe if you guys can also talk about your relationship to LA as you start. Turner, why don\u2019t we start with you?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Turner Novak:</strong> Hey, everyone. I\u2019m Turner. I am the founder of Banana Capital. My relationship with LA, it\u2019s my second home that I visit once a quarter.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Minnie Ingersoll:</strong> Hi, I\u2019m Minnie Ingersoll. I\u2019m a partner at TenOneTen. TenOneTen is an LA-based fund, started with two missions in mind. Our first mission is to support early stage technical founders. Our second is to return tons of money to our investors. We were started in 2014 by my partners, Gil Elbaz and David Waxman. They were both technical founders who had scaled companies, and they built the fund that they wanted to see. I started a company in 2013 called Shift. I had the chance to exit Shift, it\u2019s a used car company, in 2019, and join TenOneTen then. And now, we\u2019re investing out of our third fund. I\u2019m from LA, so I\u2019m thrilled to be back in LA, Pasadena.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Andrew Chen:</strong> Nice. And it turns out we\u2019re neighbors, actually. We\u2019re both neighbors in Venice. I\u2019m Andrew Chen from a16z, and I\u2019m part of the first GAMES FUND that we built, which is very, very tied into LA. It\u2019s really the reason why I started to visit in the first place. So, I just moved to Venice. I live in the canals. My neighbors are ducks. We have a canoe. It\u2019s fantastic. Highly recommended.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Michelle:</strong> Great. So, because you guys all had differing levels of connection to LA, I wanted to start by asking what you guys thought of Katia\u2019s presentation. Was there any data points that stuck out for you? Was it exactly what you would expect from a survey of people working in LA?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Minnie:</strong> I\u2019m happy to jump in. So, I think it all comes down to culture. And it was interesting when Katia talked about it. She talked about the culture of the city. I think of a lot of the culture of the LA tech community. We talk about how at startups, the first 12 employees set the culture of a startup. I think the same is really true of an ecosystem. And I credit a lot of the founders and VCs who were here early because I think they\u2019ve set that up. And I will just add, because I think it\u2019s important, that I think LA Tech Week has been an amazing example of being welcoming, inclusive. I know a16z set this up, but they\u2019ve really included almost all the funds in LA. And it\u2019s been fabulous.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Andrew:</strong> Yeah. What I was going to say on the presentation is it is absolutely true. I\u2019ve seen it for myself, just the influx of fantastic people over the last few years. I think this is always a place where folks from Silicon Valley would visit. But it was always a place that you would visit, and then you\u2019d go back to the bubble. That was always the thing. And the amazing thing over the last two years has been to see the founders of places like Airtable and Patreon, and AngelList, and Coinbase, and many, many, many other folks actually call LA home. Now, interestingly, not everybody is as active on Twitter announcing all these things, but there are so many people\u2026 I mean, it\u2019s incredible how many people are here. And so I think just seeing that whole community coalesce really seemed super obvious.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Turner:</strong> Yeah. I think, for me, I remember seeing, it was a couple of years ago, LA, it\u2019s either the second or third largest economic region in the world. So, it\u2019s really wasn\u2019t surprising when Katia said it was the fastest growing of all the hubs. I think it makes sense if you drag the spreadsheet out, it\u2019ll probably keep you going pretty quick because you have a lot to grow into. I don\u2019t have a source for that stat either, so I made it up</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Michelle:</strong> And I feel like you can\u2019t really talk about calling out the last two years, obviously, without mentioning the pandemic. So, how do you think the pandemic has played a role in driving all this growth? It\u2019s the growth of remote work, which allows people to do this, allows people to understand that it\u2019s possible. I would love to get your takes on how you see the effects of the pandemic.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Andrew:</strong> Well, at least the firm has come out and said, \u201cLook, we\u2019re going to the cloud, right?\u201d And what does that really mean? It doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re uploading our consciousness into the metaverse, that comes later. But what we\u2019re doing instead is we\u2019re opening up offices in LA, in New York, we have one in Miami. There\u2019s probably gonna be more coming down the line. And I think it\u2019s our sincere belief that we\u2019re not going to go back to the way that things were pre-COVID, right? We\u2019re not going to all go back to an office five days a week. Instead, there\u2019s going to be a lot more different new creative ways to work. And what that means is, hubs like LA stand to significantly benefit because, all of a sudden, if you\u2019re an investor, you can meet people from all over the world on Zoom. If you\u2019re a founder, you can have a distributed team, including folks in Europe, including folks in Latin America, including folks in all the other startup hubs, and you can build a massive company. And so I think this has kicked off, this whole wave has kicked off something brand new. And I think that\u2019s why this time is going to be very different than all the various kinds of waves before.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Minnie:</strong> I\u2019m the solo B2B investor, I think, on this panel. And I would add to Turner\u2019s point about it being the second largest economy in the United States, nearly a trillion-dollar GDP here. When you look at B2B investing, you look at the massive industries here. It\u2019s a great source of talent, it\u2019s a great opportunity when you look at the manufacturing, the logistics, insurance, entertainment. There\u2019s massive industries. And I think it\u2019s fabulous to have capital that is close to the people and close to the industries that they\u2019re building for. I think that\u2019s fairly unique. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything wrong with VC-backed companies building for other VC-backed companies, but I think it actually is different here in LA in the sort of B2B companies you see.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Michelle:</strong> Kind a follow to that, what do you guys see as maybe misperceptions then? There\u2019s a lot that\u2019s drawing people to LA, but, obviously, there\u2019s still reasons why people might be reluctant to start. What are some of the biggest misperceptions?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Minnie:</strong> Okay, I have a podcast, I have to just mention this. I have a podcast. A lot of people in the room know because I talk about my podcast. It\u2019s called \u201cLA Venture.\u201d And on \u201cLA Venture,\u201d I interview a different LA-based partner at a VC fund every week. And everyone tells me, you\u2019re going to run out of guests. I hear that all the time. And the truth is, I\u2019ve been doing it for three and a half years. I\u2019ve had 170 episodes, and my pipeline gets bigger and bigger the more I do it. I think that is a misconception. And I think it\u2019s a great thing, again, to have capital close to industry.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Andrew:</strong> Yeah, I was going to add to that because Hollywood has historically been such a huge part of the ecosystem. You know, people I think naturally assume that everything is connected to the celebrity and influencer scene. And there absolutely is that part, right? But what\u2019s also amazing to me is, one of our initiatives, the American Dynamism effort, a lot of it is around deep tech. It\u2019s around aerospace, it\u2019s around building these brand-new industries. And guess where the headquarters of all that is? It\u2019s here, right? I mean, in SoCal. And I think that is a huge part. There are very serious engineers and folks that are coming out of the top schools in this area. I think the kinds of companies that are being built are actually very diverse. There\u2019s a reason why this is a major effort around crypto also in the city is for all of those reasons. And so I think it\u2019s a way broader and more diverse set of companies than you think.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Turner:</strong> Yeah, I think maybe adding to misconceptions, maybe broadly, I do a lot of consumer investing, and I think a lot of people will tell you, you have to be in San Francisco just because of density of talent. I just don\u2019t think it\u2019s true. I mean, we saw the screen, I forget all the companies around. There are so many. There\u2019s tons of very large exited tech companies that were headquartered in L.A. You know, way back in the day, MySpace, but then also, I forget the name, Applied Semantics, maybe that\u2019s the wrong one, it\u2019s Google\u2019s advertising business.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Minnie:</strong> Shout out to Gil Elbaz.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Turner: </strong>I mean, it\u2019s like Google\u2019s advertising business, it\u2019s like the best business in the world. The thing that powers it, it was based in LA. There\u2019s definitely been a lot of misconceptions. I think Katia did a really good job highlighting a lot of things in the presentation.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Michelle:</strong> Switching gears a little bit. Turner, you\u2019re not based in LA., but I feel like you have mastered the very LA art of storytelling and working with memes. I was wondering if you could talk a bit about how you first got started, how you realized you were good at it, what makes you good at it, but also what makes a good meme versus a bad meme? Like, when do you push the line, and then when do you know to hold back?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Turner:</strong> So I was born in Canada, grew up in Michigan, and never moved to San Francisco. So I had to figure out how to meet people. And it was on the internet, a lot of Twitter writing. And then I guess there\u2019s a period of time, maybe four years ago, some of the popular meme and parody accounts had started. I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s ghostwriting, but you get to know them and you give them some ideas. And my ideas did really well. So, I was like, \u201cWhy don\u2019t I just start making memes?\u201d Like, people love it. And I think it\u2019s just a way to show a little bit more authenticity. I think that\u2019s kind of the secret to storytelling is you want people to be entertained and you want to have it be as authentic to you as possible, to make it really easy to scale. Based in LA, everyone knows about creators, all that kind of stuff. But I think burnout is real in any creative artistic pursuit. So, if you do something that\u2019s very authentic to who you are, it\u2019s just a little bit easier to kind of scale it and keep it going. And for me, I\u2019m a serious person, but I don\u2019t take myself very seriously. So, memes just kind of slotted in pretty easily. And when it comes to taking it too far, memes specifically, for me, the strategy is, you just kind of poke fun at higher-level things, you never put down any one individual or person, it\u2019s always a class. And I think VCs, it\u2019s very easy to make fun of VCs. And I am one. So, I think some of us are very self-aware and some of us aren\u2019t, but it\u2019s entertaining content. So, the intersection of all those things, just, it kind of snowballed over time. And it\u2019s fun too.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Michelle:</strong> And I think the interesting thing that you were talking about is, obviously, this is also a lot of work, right? It\u2019s not like you work for five minutes a day and you\u2019re done\u2026or maybe it is.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Turner:</strong> Sometimes I don\u2019t proofread them. Sometimes there\u2019s typos in them. But, yeah, that kind of is why it worked for me. It just scaled really well.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Michelle:</strong> So, Andrew, you\u2019re actually an LP in Turner\u2019s fund. Are his memes and storytelling something that first attracted you to Turner?\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Andrew:</strong> I think one of the fun things about what we do is you get to meet all these amazing people, and you meet them over Twitter, right? And I think, again, this is one of the magic parts about this sort of post-COVID setup. And so one of the things I\u2019ve done over the years is to actually LP probably two dozen funds at this point. And I think half of them, or at least, a quarter or third of them are LA-based funds. And that is such an awesome way to get to know all the investors in the community and to hear about all the amazing things. And what Turner\u2019s done an amazing job of, in particular, is, in the world of consumer investing and all the new social products and photo products, this is a whole area that we still believe there\u2019s still a ton of innovation left. And Turner is on top of every single one of those products. And being in LA, that\u2019s one of the things that you get to chat with a lot of influencers and creators about is their use of all these tools.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Michelle:</strong> Minnie, you were mentioning that you were born in Pasadena, you moved away, you came back, you have your podcast. What have been some of the most insightful things you\u2019ve actually learned from talking to so many people in-depth on your podcast? What are some of the lessons that you\u2019ve taken away?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Minnie:</strong> Lately, I\u2019ve had a lot on the intersection of tech. It\u2019s been interesting. I just had Charlie Hanna from Marcy Venture Partners, that\u2019s Jay-Z\u2019s fund. They grew from $30 million to $900 million. I mean, huge jump. I had Megan from a16z\u2019s Cultural Leadership fund. You know, that intersection has been just a growing theme. Actually, I had Plus Capital on, and they talked a lot about how it seems like you can sort of slap a celebrity into some people, right? They can make an investment. But really, what Plus has built, for instance, is they talked a lot about that infrastructure because the startup isn\u2019t set to measure what success looks like from the celebrity, and the celebrity isn\u2019t really set up to measure that success.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">So, really setting up those connections in a very deliberate way has been really interesting because agents, like the talent agents, they\u2019re not set to take a percent if you make an investment. They\u2019re set to take a percent, I think it\u2019s like 10% of the cash that you get. So, that\u2019s been one of the really interesting things. I also get a lot of listeners who are very interested in hearing what\u2019s going on in the LA ecosystem. I mean, the reason I started the podcast was when I moved here, I couldn\u2019t find out that much about the investors. I felt like LA was actually really underexposed relative\u2026 I feel like a lot of the investors\u2026I like VC as well, but I do feel like they\u2019re more vocal, tend to be more vocal in the Bay Area, and I felt like LA was underexposed. So, it actually is a lot of work. But I was asking Mark Suster, \u201cHow do you become a great blogger or that sort of thing?\u201d And he was like, \u201cYou have to like to write.\u201d And it turns out I like to talk, so it suits me.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Andrew:</strong> Well, and we were having a funny conversation before about how the Bay Area investors often had a secret partner in LA. Do you want to talk about that?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Minnie:</strong> Yes, I mean, I was saying that I think a16a is the first fund from Silicon Valley, a traditional Silicon Valley fund, that is really publicly had a big presence here in LA. And that it used to be that you might have one partner from one of the other Sand Hill Road funds in LA, but their LinkedIn might still say San Francisco. And so I think it\u2019s a big change for LA, and I think it\u2019s really the right fund to be planting the tent pole here.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Andrew:</strong> A lot of it was, I think, from a career standpoint, if you felt like you had to meet the founders in the Bay Area that actually going\u2026and being anywhere other than the Bay Area was kind of like maybe you were less serious about those kinds of founders. And so there was so much pressure I think for\u2026 You know, I was in the Bay Area for 15 years, and so there was always so much pressure to just be there, and stay there, and just do that. And I think being able to work on Zoom, and also, obviously, the trends of everyone moving around has just really significantly changed things. And so I think many of you know this, but we\u2019re putting a big office next to Elephante in Santa Monica. That\u2019s going to be, I think, 30,000 square feet. It\u2019s like a whole building. We already have 25 employees in LA, and that\u2019s going to significantly grow as well. We\u2019re taking all these additional regions very seriously.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Michelle:</strong> Andrew, you mentioned, we have this new office, you have just moved here, and then you\u2019re working on a new fund. I know that we have another games panel later in this afternoon. But I was wondering if you could also talk a bit about what you\u2019re looking for, why you came, anything that\u2019s been surprising to you that you didn\u2019t already expect.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Andrew:</strong> So I joined Andreessen Horowitz four and a half years ago, something like that. And really, my focus there was around social networks. And so think of that as: every generation of consumers really has their own new social network, right? And so if you grew up, maybe you were using AOL Instant Messenger for a while, or you were using MySpace, or you were using\u2026 you remember when all your young friends were on Facebook. And now, when you talk to Gen Z, first, they maybe don\u2019t even have a kind of big blue main Facebook account, they\u2019re just using Instagram. And then when you go even younger, what you find is that the 10-year-olds, the 12-year-olds are spending all their time either playing Minecraft and Roblox or watching videos about Minecraft or Roblox. That\u2019s where they want to really hang out with their friends.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">And so with the a16z GAMES FUND ONE, the idea there and what kind of led us in that direction is there\u2019s an amazing new trend among consumers. Just the adoption, again, at the intersection of technology and entertainment is just so strong within games. And the center of that in the country and on the continent is really in Los Angeles. And so it really just naturally fit that, \u201cI should move here, I should, you know, work on the fund full-time.\u201d Most of the portfolio, most of the games portfolio is also here. My partner, Jon Lai, is going to be interviewing some folks later today and going deeper in metaverse, and avatars, and gaming, and all that good stuff.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Michelle:</strong> Turner, I wanted to come back to you because I feel like you have the newest fund out of everyone on the stage. How difficult did you find it to get started? And how are you thinking about expansion plans?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Turner:</strong> Yeah, getting started, it was hard, but I just did a lot of work ahead of time. I guess, for people thinking about starting a fund, Google, read blogs on how to do it, take it very seriously, all the playbooks, I won\u2019t go through it. But it\u2019s a lot of work, definitely. I think one of my best tweets was actually a joke about why I see why people join a16z instead of starting their own fund because it\u2019s just a lot of work. And the expansion plans. I mean, I\u2019m not trying to build the next Tiger Global. I don\u2019t want hundreds of billions of dollars in AUM. I am just trying to be a good investor, and find good founders, invest in the pre-seed and seed mostly doing consumer stuff. So, we follow on a little bit over time. Sometimes we\u2019ll do some SBVs, like, a little bit later stage, keep making memes, slowly add to the team, should be fun.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Michelle:</strong> Do you require everyone joining your team to have a certain level of followers before they\u2019re allowed to apply?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Turner:</strong> Actually, I don\u2019t.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Michelle</strong>: And you were based in Ann Arbor, so I just wanted to ask, do you have any plans to move? Or is it totally possible to completely stay in the cloud as it were?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Turner:</strong> Yeah, I think you can be totally in the cloud. And it\u2019s kind of fun to\u2026you know, married with two kids, it can be nice to say, \u201cOh, I\u2019m gonna go to LA for a week.\u201d Sometimes that\u2019s nice. But I think when you\u2019re doing consumer investing, sometimes it can be helpful to live in the Midwest and outside of some of the big hubs. Kind of the joke that I make is I show some of the products that I\u2019m looking at to my wife, to my mother-in-law, get their take. Sometimes you can cut through some of the steps of what adoption will look like over time. So, that\u2019s always helpful, honestly, just kind of being a little bit insulated from some of the bubble. There\u2019s also the challenge of trying to stay connected. I was joking earlier, but LA would probably be my first choice if I could move. But, we\u2019ve got family in Michigan, so I\u2019ll probably stay there.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Michelle:</strong> So we\u2019ve just got a few more minutes left. I wanted to end by asking, what questions you\u2019re most commonly asked? So, this is an opportunity to answer a lot of questions at once. But what are you most commonly asked about investing in LA?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Minnie:</strong> People ask for money usually.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Andrew:</strong> Well, I was going to say, I think right now, the big thing is just the macro market and how to approach investing. Are people still investing right now? And in the end, and I would love to hear from all of you, is that there are tons of investors that are very active. We\u2019re very active, we\u2019re looking at tons of stuff. We\u2019ve sent out, I think there\u2019s a term sheet going out today from my team. So, I think there\u2019s a lot of activity. But it is definitely one where the bar is higher, there\u2019s more questions, there\u2019s more data. Being high growth and high burn is not a good thing. People want more efficient, higher quality businesses, etc., etc. And my colleague, David George, has a great blog post that he\u2019s written about <a href=\"https://future.com/framework-valuation-navigating-down-markets/\">how to think about the downturn and unit economics</a>, and all that good stuff coming up.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Turner:</strong> Common question, living in Michigan, how do I invest outside of Michigan? I do some international investing too. Since it\u2019s super early, it\u2019s really a lot of founder-driven questions, and you just try to pattern match other types of businesses and products and see if it would work. So some people say like, \u201cHow do you do due diligence on an LA investment if you\u2019re in Michigan?\u201d Sometimes I\u2019ve already met the founder before in person, sometimes I might go to meet them at a time, and sometimes it\u2019s a pre-seed round. They\u2019re raising a million dollars, there\u2019s no product yet, there\u2019s no diligence to do there. You do diligence, but there\u2019s not a lot. So, yeah, it\u2019s one of the questions I do get a lot and you just make it work.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Michelle:</strong> Minnie, pretty similar for you?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Minnie:</strong> Pretty similar. I mean, with thinking about what does a series A look like? I used to know we have 80 portfolio companies now. And we used to know what a series A looked like. And so I think we\u2019re looking at what is the financing risk, and what is the business risk? And we tend to do B2B companies. So, I think the business risk actually is low, but the financing risk I think is still a bit unknown.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Michelle: </strong>I wanted to thank you guys so much for your time and for coming here today. So, thank you very much.\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<div class=\"wp-content\">\n<p style=\"text-align: center\">***</p>\n<p><i>The above transcript is abridged and edited for clarity.</i></p>\n<p><i>The views expressed here are those of the individual AH Capital Management, L.L.C.

Why that mission and that problem space?</p>\n<p><strong>Ryan:</strong> Thanks for having me here. There\u2019s a couple angles that I approach this from. One is you look at the pie chart of GDP, and where is all the money spent? Where is all the activity in the economy? If you were to divide each of those slices by the number of hours of computer programming that have been applied, you would see that logistics is one of the biggest opportunities in the world. This is an incredibly important space. Trade is 47% of GDP, and yet, when I used to run a business importing motorcycles from Asia and selling them on the internet back in the early 2000s, late \u201990s, it was just a nightmare.</p>\n<p>Here\u2019s something that\u2019s really important. You can measure its importance by the number of dollars that are spent, and the size relative to GDP, but also it has been the backbone of the world economy. It\u2019s the circulatory system of the world economy.</p>\n<p>On many levels, I might argue that the shipping container was the most important invention of the 20th century. We\u2019ve reduced the cost of shipping things by like 99%. We used to have to load these ships, backbreaking labor, hand carrying stuff onto the ships. Yet the shipping container was invented in the \u201960s and deployed in the \u201970s and really hasn\u2019t changed much since then. Almost no innovation.</p>\n<p>Anyone who\u2019s tried to actively ship something across borders will tell you it\u2019s a nightmare. Most small businesses never can do it. Only 3% of companies are buying and selling goods across borders right now. What are the odds that every other company has all their best vendors locally?</p>\n<p>When you see something that\u2019s this important and this hard and this many dollars being spent, it\u2019s a good heat map for where to apply yourself. So, I started doing that 20 years ago.</p>\n<span class=\"bctt-click-to-tweet\"><span class=\"bctt-ctt-text\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https://a16z.com/2022/11/29/rearchitecting-the-supply-chain-with-flexports-ryan-petersen/&amp;text=When%20you%20see%20something%20that%27s%20this%20important%20and%20this%20hard%20and%20this%20many%20dollars%20being%20spent%2C%20it%27s%20a%20good%20heat%20map%20for%20where%20to%20apply%20yourself.%20-Ryan%20Petersen%2C%20Flexport&amp;via=a16z&amp;related=a16z\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">When you see something that's this important and this hard and this many dollars being spent, it's a good heat map for where to apply yourself. -Ryan Petersen, Flexport </a></span><a class=\"bctt-ctt-btn\" href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https://a16z.com/2022/11/29/rearchitecting-the-supply-chain-with-flexports-ryan-petersen/&amp;text=When%20you%20see%20something%20that%27s%20this%20important%20and%20this%20hard%20and%20this%20many%20dollars%20being%20spent%2C%20it%27s%20a%20good%20heat%20map%20for%20where%20to%20apply%20yourself.%20-Ryan%20Petersen%2C%20Flexport&amp;via=a16z&amp;related=a16z\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Click To Tweet</a></span>\n<h3><div data-toc-header=\"Starting point &amp; expansion\" id=\"section--2\"></div>Where Flexport started and how they expanded</h3>\n<p><strong>Das:</strong> It\u2019s interesting because you use this metaphor of the circulatory system, and all the pain points, which I think explains why people haven\u2019t really tackled it before. It\u2019s one of the hardest, most complex spaces to be in with the supply chain. Knowing that going in, how did you decide where to start? And then how have you thought about when and where to expand?</p>\n<p><strong>Ryan:</strong> We benefit a lot from my own naivete, my na\u00c3\u00afve optimism, I like to call it. I never worked in the industry. I was a customer of the industry shipping motorcycles, and later selling data to the industry in another company I started. I knew enough to be dangerous. I knew what the customer experience should be. I wanted this dashboard to give me visibility over all my freight, tell me what it was gonna cost, when things were gonna arrive, what all these weird terms mean. The industry still uses Viking English. We say bill of lading, instead of loading.</p>\n<p><strong>Das:</strong> I didn\u2019t know that.</p>\n<p><strong>Ryan:</strong> There\u2019s a lot of acronyms and code words, so I wanted a simple dashboard to teach me what all that stuff means. You might call it TurboTax for importing, and the place that we started was TurboTax-like. It was customs, which is where you pay your taxes to enter into the country. This was where most of the complicated paperwork lives, where the data lives. If you wanna clear a good through US Customs, you have to provide the commercial invoice and the bill of lading, packing lists, all this incredibly rich documentation, and ultimately structured data, that now lets you understand, \u201cWhat is this company doing? What other services would they wanna buy?\u201d</p>\n<p>We started as a customs brokerage. It\u2019s the stickiness. We say in the industry, \u201cyou date your freight forwarder, but you marry your customs broker.\u201d It\u2019s a compliance service. It\u2019s not where you\u2019re trying to cut costs. Freight is a commodity, and everyone wants to go with the cheapest freight provider that they can find. But customs you\u2019re not trying to save money, you\u2019re trying to make sure you are compliant, you aren\u2019t breaking any rules. You want it to be your system of record where you are tracking everything for future audits. We started as a customs broker and then have expanded from there.</p>\n<p>What we found pretty early, to my dismay, was that we had to do it all much sooner. I thought we\u2019d just hang out as a custom broker for many years and be the best, most dialed-in custom broker. We found out as a startup customs brokerage, no one really trusted us in the beginning. We had to build our brand.</p>\n<p>We were getting all the problem cases, where other freight forwarders didn\u2019t do their customs. Red flag, right? Why is this person doing customs with me and freight with someone else? We had a lot of problem cases in the beginning. Quickly, we had to expand to offer freight services. Now we offer cargo insurance, financing for the goods. Our most important product is probably our order management product, which is where you place orders to your factories and convert those to shipments. Now we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got that transaction running through our rails, and we can offer you all those other services on top of that.</p>\n<span class=\"bctt-click-to-tweet\"><span class=\"bctt-ctt-text\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https://a16z.com/2022/11/29/rearchitecting-the-supply-chain-with-flexports-ryan-petersen/&amp;text=We%20found%20out%20as%20a%20startup%20customs%20brokerage%2C%20no%20one%20really%20trusted%20us%20in%20the%20beginning.%20We%20had%20to%20build%20our%20brand.%20-Ryan%20Petersen%2C%20Flexport&amp;via=a16z&amp;related=a16z\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">We found out as a startup customs brokerage, no one really trusted us in the beginning.

I\u2019ve heard you refer to Amazon as this company you really admire for how they handle the complexity of logistics. In fact, you have right now as your co-CEO, Dave Clark, who was formerly CEO of worldwide consumer at Amazon. Can you talk a little bit about that decision? How and why did you bring Dave in?</p>\n<p><strong>Ryan:</strong> I think Amazon\u2019s the most interesting, important company in the world, frankly. They have figured out a lot around how to be entrepreneurial at scale. A lot of it comes from operating in relatively low-margin businesses that don\u2019t have the luxury of just hiring lots of people and hoping that they do something interesting someday, like some of the other big tech companies. They have got to keep executing constantly and delivering innovation.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s pretty rare to see a big giant corporation that\u2019s figured out how to really be a team of small companies, small business units. For me, it\u2019s a wrinkle in the law of large numbers. The law of large numbers says, \u201cyou get really big, your growth rate slows down.\u201d But if, in fact, all you are is an agglomeration of small companies, each one of those small units can grow really fast, then all of a sudden the whole thing can grow really fast.</p>\n<p>I\u2019ve been a big fan of Amazon for a long time, studying them from the outside. I\u2019m learning about this. I really enjoy the process. I think it\u2019s intellectually stimulating\u00e2\u0080\u0094how do you drive efficiency from a workforce? Studying things like the Toyota Production System or W. E. Deming. There\u2019s a lot of great, almost deeply philosophical work about how to get operational excellence and drive quality. But I\u2019m learning on the job, which there\u2019s no excuse for that, given our industry. We need more experience.</p>\n<p>I was looking for a strong number two that could immediately upgrade our ability to run really high quality and highly efficient operations on behalf of our customers. Naturally, Amazon\u2019s the place I\u2019m looking.</p>\n<p>One of my secrets for recruiting, first of all, I do it myself when I\u2019m doing exec recruiting. I don\u2019t rely on outside search firms. I build my own list and track that in Google Sheets. Nothing fancy. I just go through my own network and ask everybody in my network who they would introduce me to just to learn from. I say, \u201cLook, non-attachment to outcomes. I just wanna learn.\u201d If each of those people gives me three people and each of those people gives me three people, you have kinda this cancerous growth that eventually you get to everybody.</p>\n<span class=\"bctt-click-to-tweet\"><span class=\"bctt-ctt-text\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https://a16z.com/2022/11/29/rearchitecting-the-supply-chain-with-flexports-ryan-petersen/&amp;text=The%20law%20of%20large%20numbers%20says%2C%20%27you%20get%20really%20big%2C%20your%20growth%20rate%20slows%20down.%27%20But%20if%2C%20in%20fact%2C%20all%20you%20are%20is%20an%20agglomeration%20of%20small%20companies%2C%20each%20one%20of%20those%20small%20units%20can%20grow%20really%20fast.%20-Ryan%20Petersen%2C%20Flexport&amp;via=a16z&amp;related=a16z\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">The law of large numbers says, 'you get really big, your growth rate slows down.'

I want to circle back to this idea of what it\u2019s going to take to become that world-best operational company. But I want to step back first and talk more generally about the supply chain. You\u2019ve mentioned the admiration that you have for Amazon. Really, nobody epitomizes the rise of ecommerce more. What have you seen as the impact of ecommerce and the internet on the supply chain, and on how it works?</p>\n<p><strong>Ryan:</strong> You want to start with the customers, with all of us. The internet has really put us, you and me, and everybody else out there, in charge in a way that we\u2019ve never seen before.</p>\n<p>In the era of mass media, companies would only run a television ad for whatever product they were selling, and then they would just pump that down your throat. They only needed to have a limited number of SKUs, whatever was on television basically. Customers didn\u2019t have a lot of choice. They could buy the Energizer or the Duracell. There were 2 choices for a battery, and they happened to be in the stores. The brands were in control. Those who could afford mass media were in control.</p>\n<p>Now with the internet, there\u2019s just a million choices. You have every possible brand of battery that\u2019s out there. A battery\u2019s probably a weird case, but for every product category, there\u2019s a million choices. Everybody\u2019s unique. You can get the thing that matches your own personal taste. You are in charge as well, in that they better have that product now. You\u2019re not willing to wait a week.</p>\n<p>In the Sears catalog era, you could order and you get it in three weeks. Well, you\u2019re going to go out of business if you can\u2019t deliver in two hours. That is a very different supply chain.</p>\n<p>Companies that haven\u2019t been able to run a supply chain that\u2019s that responsive, that can have a wider assortment of choices, because we\u2019re all unique and we want our choices, and have it sort of edge-cashed, to use an internet analogy, like a CDN\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 You want to have these goods close to the customer so that it can get there really, really fast.</p>\n<p>In the old world, you could have one distribution center in the middle of the United States and distribute out to your store network from there. It didn\u2019t have to be super responsive to customer demand. Customer demand was pretty predictable. They kind of always bought the same number of these batteries or whatever product. It didn\u2019t have to be very agile.</p>\n<p>The modern world, all of a sudden, there\u2019s this proliferation of brands, and it all has to be stored close to the edges. Brands need to have multiple fulfillment centers. You need about five fulfillment centers to get two-day delivery nationwide. Next day, it\u2019s more like 16 fulfillment centers. If you want to do same-day, you need one in almost every zip code. If you want to have two-hour delivery, that\u2019s a really different configuration of supply chain.</p>\n<p>To get to that world where you\u2019re doing same day or next day delivery, you now need to load balance your inventory, because if you put too much inventory out there and it doesn\u2019t sell, you\u2019re going to go bankrupt. You\u2019re sitting on all this working capital, this inventory, that\u2019s not earning a return. Too little, and you lose the customer, and they\u2019ll never come back. They buy your competitor\u2019s brand. That\u2019s the fundamental problem.</p>\n<p>These logistics teams at the typical brand don\u2019t even really know that that\u2019s the problem they\u2019re solving. They\u2019re still used to a world where all they care about is the price of freight, and they want to buy the cheapest freight. That\u2019s what they think their job is, when their job has become: how do I ensure a customer experience? How do I enable our sales and marketing to have the product in stock so that they can win those customers, be a growth engine, and a customer experience engine? And then how do they empower their CFO to not sit on too much inventory?</p>\n<p>It\u2019s a really different proposition, and frankly, most of the companies that we grew up with, these iconic brands, have been going bankrupt left and right. If you google \u00e2\u0080\u009cretail apocalypse\u00e2\u0080\u009d and just look at the number of companies that have failed that are iconic brands that we grew up with. It\u2019s really sad actually. I don\u2019t think it has to be that way.</p>\n<p>We kind of have a dual purpose here. One is to help the new age of brands rise up and not need to hire this big logistics supply chain team who just pushes paper and all they care about is the price of freight, but to actually be empowered to solve these problems without hiring a big team, because you don\u2019t need it anymore. You outsource that to the cloud. That\u2019s one aspect of what we do. We help these small businesses grow really fast without the bureaucracy.</p>\n<p>The other is how do you help these enterprise brands, these famous companies, transform themselves through a world of ecommerce and not die. Both of these are really important missions for us.</p>\n<span class=\"bctt-click-to-tweet\"><span class=\"bctt-ctt-text\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https://a16z.com/2022/11/29/rearchitecting-the-supply-chain-with-flexports-ryan-petersen/&amp;text=In%20the%20Sears%20catalog%20era%2C%20you%20could%20order%20and%20you%20get%20it%20in%20three%20weeks.%20Well%2C%20you%27re%20going%20to%20go%20out%20of%20business%20if%20you%20can%27t%20deliver%20in%20two%20hours.%20That%20is%20a%20very%20different%20supply%20chain.%20-Ryan%20Petersen%2C%20Flexport&amp;via=a16z&amp;related=a16z\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">In the Sears catalog era, you could order and you get it in three weeks.

I\u2019ve heard you say in the past that one of your goals is to make the supply chain as resilient and reliable as the power grid. It\u2019s one thing to do that in normal times. It\u2019s another thing to do it as you have a pandemic occurring, and a war in Ukraine, that are creating these delays and disruptions and shortages that we read about.</p>\n<p>What will it take to get the supply chain to that point? In particular, because you\u2019re talking about an architectural shift of the supply chain, what will it take to help those legacy players get there?</p>\n<p><strong>Ryan:</strong> The fundamental problem in supply chain is that we\u2019re a chain. There\u2019s many companies. In fact, on a typical transaction where we\u2019re moving let\u2019s say a pallet of goods, a cubic meter of goods, from a factory in pick a city \u00e2\u0080\u0093 in Hangzhou, China to St. Louis, Missouri. On a transaction like that, you\u2019ll have at least 12 companies that either touch the goods physically or are involved providing capital, like trade finance, or a letter of credit, cargo insurance, bank payments. At least 12, and as many as 20 companies, are involved in that transaction. You get information bottlenecks.</p>\n<p>The goods bottlenecks are famous, and we see the ships waiting offshore and all the problems. But what\u2019s happening in parallel is that the data\u2019s not flowing. People at each stage are having to rekey data into a system, or not bothering, forwarding PDFs. We call it freight forwarding. I often joke it should be called freight email forwarding because you are just emailing attachments between all these different companies and trying to wrangle it. It leads to suboptimal decision making.</p>\n<p>If you had perfect information, you would make sure the truck is waiting at the airport when the plane lands or at the seaport when the container shows up. You would get it all dialed in. Every truck would be scheduled appropriately, and you would be re-planning every five minutes so that if there\u2019s any delay, you\u2019re automatically generating a new plan and reallocating containers. Almost none of that can happen because there\u2019s not a system. It\u2019s 12 different companies, each running their own IT system, or in many cases, guys in warehouses with clipboards and no IT systems at all.</p>\n<p>There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 2 possible solutions. One is that a giant mega corporation owns all the assets door-to-door and creates 1 IT backbone for everybody. The other is to use ML and data science and make it in the interest of asset owners to come onto the platform.</p>\n<p><strong>Das:</strong> Almost like data is the new kind of killer asset.</p>\n<p><strong>Ryan:</strong> It should be. You should be able to really generate insights. The more transactions that are flowing, the smarter you get. How are we going to route this container? You know in advance, \u201cOh, you know what, there\u2019s actually a bottleneck in LA right now. Let\u2019s route it through Oakland.\u201d Things like this that the industry hasn\u2019t been that good at.</p>\n<p>It was really interesting to watch last year, we had 100 container ships waiting off the port of LA, and only five waiting off the coast of Oakland here in the Bay. You have to go past Oakland to get to LA. Why don\u2019t they stop and just unload the stuff? It\u2019s hard. They don\u2019t have the data. They\u2019re not able to communicate in real time, make agile decisions, etc. But that\u2019s going to be the future, actually using tech and using data to route assets in a smarter way.</p>\n<p><strong>Das:</strong> I could easily stay and talk all day about supply chain, but I know that we are at time now. Thank you so much, Ryan, for coming in and talking to us today.</p>\n<p><strong>Ryan:</strong> My pleasure. My pleasure. Thanks for having me.</p>\n<span class=\"bctt-click-to-tweet\"><span class=\"bctt-ctt-text\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https://a16z.com/2022/11/29/rearchitecting-the-supply-chain-with-flexports-ryan-petersen/&amp;text=The%20goods%20bottlenecks%20are%20famous%2C%20and%20we%20see%20the%20ships%20waiting%20offshore%20and%20all%20the%20problems.%20But%20what%27s%20happening%20in%20parallel%20is%20that%20the%20data%27s%20not%20flowing.%20-Ryan%20Petersen%2C%20Flexport&amp;via=a16z&amp;related=a16z\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">The goods bottlenecks are famous, and we see the ships waiting offshore and all the problems.

I figured it out when I was about 12 years old. I was visiting my uncle, who lived in San Francisco at the time. And I made it my mission to beat him at all of his games before I left for the visit. And it was during that time that it dawned on me that someone gets to make games. And I thought, <em>that\u2019s awesome; why not me</em>? I had already been into robotics and done a little bit of programming. But that\u2019s when I really decided to focus on that as a career and started working on game projects in my spare time.</p>\n<p><strong>Lauren Murrow, a16z</strong>: So how does building for cloud differ from what you\u2019ve done before?</p>\n<p><strong>Jade</strong>: I\u2019ve always been attracted by the bleeding edge of games. Games are constantly reinvented. If you look at what a video game was 10 years ago, it was totally different, 20 years ago. What drew me to working on the \u00e2\u0080\u009cAssassin\u2019s Creed\u00e2\u0080\u009d franchise and building that up was that next-gen consoles were coming. And that was a big opportunity to go, okay, what can we do with 8X the processing power? And so a lot of those questions that have pushed me towards my career decisions all along is what attracted me to Google this time. Which is: okay, it\u2019s not 8X, it\u2019s the whole data center as your processing power. Okay, it\u2019s the whole model for how we think about client server and multiplayer games needing to work is totally upended and changed.</p>\n<p><strong>Lauren</strong>: Some of the largest games today\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u201dFortnite,\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cClash of Clans\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u0094run most of their network on the cloud. So Jon, what distinguishes what we have now from true cloud streaming or what you call cloud-native gaming?</p>\n<p><strong>Jon Lai, a16z partner</strong>: The first wave, which is what we\u2019re seeing right now, looks like it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mostly been ports of existing PC and console titles. And so, taking a title that\u2019s already under development for the Playstation4, the Xbox One and then distributing it in the cloud. But these games were fundamentally developed for a different hardware platform. And so we\u2019re most excited about this second wave of games that might be coming around the corner. We call them cloud-native games, but what they really are is any game that\u2019s built from the ground up for the cloud that\u2019s only playable within a cloud infrastructure, as opposed to something that was just ported.</p>\n<p><strong>Jade</strong>: We <em>are</em> currently in the first wave of cloud gaming. And really what we\u2019re seeing is the convenience of cloud gaming. What we\u2019re seeing is, okay, it\u2019s all the games that we can play in other places, but we get rid of the download time. We can play more instantly. We don\u2019t have to worry about updates. We can play on different screens. Those are great benefits, but I think the really exciting thing, what\u2019s going to be the equivalent of what TV was to radio, is when we unlock what the second wave of cloud gaming is.</p>\n<p>One of the things is, obviously, the whole client server model. Right now, you\u2019re limited to the interactions and simulations that can run locally on people\u2019s machines. Even if \u201cFortnite\u201d and a lot of other games are running on the cloud on the backend, they\u2019re still designed with the idea that they have to run on a local PC or a local console or a local mobile device, in some cases.</p>\n<p>And really what\u2019s going to unlock it is not only the processing power and what we call elastic compute of the data center, but also the idea that essentially, any game can be designed like one big LAN party. So you don\u2019t have to worry about network ping times. You can at least know exactly what those are and design for them and measure them in a consistent way. And also that hits up against the limit of how big of a shared experience you can have.</p>\n<p><strong>Lauren</strong>: Are there new game mechanics, or even game genres, that you find uniquely enabled through the cloud? Jon, you\u2019ve written about how it might help solve games \u00e2\u0080\u009ccold start\u00e2\u0080\u009d problem. But what are some of the other mechanics that you see enabled by cloud gaming?</p>\n<p><strong>Jade</strong>: When you think about the magic of cloud gaming, you\u2019re being sent a stream that\u00e2\u0080\u0094from the pipes and stuff\u00e2\u0080\u0094looks exactly like a stream of video data. When you think about this new paradigm, there can be a one to infinite and very strange connection of what inputs impact that stream. So if you think about it, someone typing in the side of a YouTube chat can have an input into my environment. They type tomato, tomatoes start falling from the sky in my game. Thousands of people connected to my game could be there playing the role of, let\u2019s say, a zombie horde that\u2019s attacking. Those all could be real players, right? And their input could just be on a mobile phone in a very simple interface for doing that. Because to be a zombie, you don\u2019t need so many controls. [laughs] I think a lot of the really exciting things that disassociation of the direct relationship between number of people connected to client, either one or X8 or whatever\u00e2\u0080\u0094one hundred is typically the biggest we\u2019ve seen\u00e2\u0080\u0094and this way that tons of inputs can impact the simulation live.</p>\n<p><strong>Jon</strong>: I love that idea. I think there\u2019s always been something magical in the combination of live video and games. You have this Twitch Plays series where someone will play a game on Twitch, except the people playing it are actually the Twitch audience. It started off with Pokemon and it\u2019s gone through several games. But it\u2019s essentially crowd-sourced game playing. And then recently you\u2019ve had these things like Netflix \u00e2\u0080\u009cBandersnatch.\u00e2\u0080\u009d People have experimented with making interactive, choose-your-own-adventure stories so that the whole family can play and debate over, like, whether you go left or right, or if the protagonist should, like, kiss the girl or not. So I think there\u2019s something magical about that kind of combination of live video and games.</p>\n<p>I would love to figure out: what does a next generation \u00e2\u0080\u009cAmerican Idol\u00e2\u0080\u009d look like, where you have millions of people all watching the same stream that are voting or typing or doing something to affect the show? Because I feel like there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s something there that we haven\u2019t seen yet that could be pretty compelling.</p>\n<p>And then even things like \u00e2\u0080\u009c<a href=\"https://a16z.com/2020/10/25/16mins-among-us-gaming-social-streaming-reality-tv/\">Among Us</a>,\u00e2\u0080\u009d which is so, so popular right now. I\u2019ve often wondered: is there a way for that to be more interactive between the people that are watching? Because it\u2019s a big live streaming phenomenon. So, for example, imagine an \u00e2\u0080\u009cAmong Us\u00e2\u0080\u009d game where the audience actually voted on who the imposter was. And it becomes the player\u2019s job to try to act and convince the live streaming audience that they\u2019re not the imposter and this other person is. It becomes, like, 50 percent <a href=\"https://a16z.com/2020/09/01/tabletop-games-go-digital/\">D&amp;D</a>, 25 percent game, and 25 percent reality TV show.</p>\n<p><strong>Lauren</strong>: On that note, what are some new business models that you would expect cloud gaming to enable? One area I\u2019m interested in, in particular, is how it might set the new stage for even new forms of marketing.</p>\n<p><strong>Jade</strong>: I\u2019m sort of obsessed with the idea of bringing back arcades, or the arcade experience, now that cloud gaming is here. Because really, you don\u2019t have to pay for a whole game anymore. So even with this first wave, there\u2019s an opportunity to say, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, maybe, I buy a bunch of coins like I did in the arcade. And I play 10 minutes of this and then I hop to the next. And my coins go to the next experience.\u00e2\u0080\u009d I think there\u2019s a whole bunch of interesting ways to think about that opening up games, as well, to all kinds of communities that maybe can\u2019t afford the $70 or didn\u2019t get to play AAA games, right? And then you could also create business models that could be those coins, you buy them or they\u2019re ad-subsidized.</p>\n<p>So I feel there\u2019s a ton of opportunities not only in business models, but also how you think about recommendation systems. Like, imagine we\u2019re in a crew and we wanted to get a high-impact bunch of combat, like we wanted some melee combat kind of action. You could imagine making a playlist of 100 different games with the highlights of all the best melee Boss battle parts. And as a little group, we could sort of teleport from game experience to game experience. So there\u2019s a whole lot we can do in terms of delivery, recommendation, and business models.</p>\n<p><strong>Lauren</strong>: Do you think game companies and developers will also have to figure out new pricing models, with this paradigm shift?</p>\n<p><strong>Jade</strong>: We\u2019re seeing a big shift towards subscription. There\u2019s been an ongoing shift towards free-to-play in games. And then I think, you know, there are the new crazy ideas that I had for more traditional box products of: how can we bring back the arcade? Can we bring back micro payments? Can we bring back ad revenue?</p>\n<p>I think also, though, if we\u2019re talking about the Metaverse vision, then what\u2019s the marketplace? Is there a global marketplace for all of these experiences that people can tap into? Is there a kind of eBay for virtual stuff? And can that virtually move back and forth between the different experiences? Is there an API or a standard so that stuff can move around between these experiences?</p>\n<p><strong>Jon</strong>: The interesting thing is there are historical precedents for all these pricing models. What keeps me up at night is trying to figure out: Are there new pricing models that we haven\u2019t seen yet that are possible within a cloud gaming ecosystem that actually make more sense than any of those models? Because subscriptions made sense in a legacy world. Free-to-play made sense in mobile, for example. These are all things that worked in other platforms.</p>\n<p>But is there something that leverages the blockchain, for example? If there was a marketplace of goods that people were trading and every good is uniquely identifiable and there\u2019s a limited supply of them, then you essentially create virtual economies inside of these games and these worlds.</p>\n<p>And so then the pricing models become actually more like real life. People might have jobs inside these games. They might be trading their time; time becomes a new currency. It feels like we\u2019re still scratching the surface when we just think of subscriptions and free-to-play and a la carte. Because that\u2019s what worked in the old world. It might not be the thing that takes off in the next wave of cloud-native games.</p>\n<p><strong>Jade</strong>: Yeah, when I look around it does seem like everyone, Stadia included, is currently focused on being the \u201cNetflix of gaming,\u201d with a model of some form of subscription. And I think that\u2019s great. But I think the real killer app for gaming, and cloud gaming in particular, is becoming the \u201cYouTube of gaming.\u201d</p>\n<p>I think if you look at what I believe the history of the internet is, we had the internet of text. Now there\u2019s the internet of video, and obviously TikTok is one of the latest examples. Kids go to YouTube to search now, rather than other search engines. They\u2019d rather watch a 10-minute video than read a two-minute text. That\u2019s the way people process now.</p>\n<p>I think the future is the internet of experiences. And I do think that cloud-native gaming\u00e2\u0080\u0094and something like the vision of the YouTube of gaming\u00e2\u0080\u0094is going to enable that internet of experiences.</p>\n<p><strong>Jon</strong>: In this environment where people can just click to play, do you think that fundamentally changes the types of games that we\u2019ll have? Might the design playbook also change to accommodate people being able to come in and out of games much more easily?</p>\n<p><strong>Jade</strong>: Absolutely. What we started to see in game development vocabulary is \u00e2\u0080\u009ctime to fun\u00e2\u0080\u009d becoming an important thing. It used to be fine to have these really long intros and cut scenes and then make people go through all of this character customization before they even knew what they were customizing the character for. And I think the new best practice\u00e2\u0080\u0094and it\u2019s not so new because we\u2019ve been talking about this now probably for the last five to 10 years\u00e2\u0080\u0094is how do we shorten that \u00e2\u0080\u009ctime to fun.\u00e2\u0080\u009d And with this instant play and with click to pay, that\u2019s going to become more and more important.</p>\n<p><strong>Jon</strong>: And instant games also seems to be on the verge of having a comeback, the concept of HTML5 browser games. There are a bunch of IO games that have recently reached hundreds of millions of people playing. And this has been around for quite some time, right? You have things like Slither.io, that snake game where you\u2019re trying to eat other snakes in a browser.</p>\n<p>But it feels like today there are so many social channels that are virally propagating these links. So you have people sharing on Discord, you have people sharing YouTube. Things are going viral over at Twitter and Reddit. And so instant games seem to be adjacent to cloud gaming, and maybe they merge in some way.</p>\n<p><strong>Jade</strong>: I\u2019ve thought about the same thing, and I think that\u2019s evidence of the appeal of cloud gaming and instant access. Because that \u00e2\u0080\u009ctime to fun\u00e2\u0080\u009d metric is so important. So how do we now deliver that for the HD experience? Really thinking about different entry points and scaling those for different people.</p>\n<p><strong>Lauren</strong>: You mentioned that you\u2019re experimenting with click to play. The [cloud gaming] space, of course, is growing increasingly competitive. You\u2019ve got PlayStation Now, you\u2019ve got GeForce, Microsoft xCloud. What is it that makes Google Stadia particularly equipped to be out in front of the cloud gaming trend?</p>\n<p><strong>Jade</strong>: Think about the Google Assistant. I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve had this experience, but it was quite an experience for me. I was with my mom hanging out in L.A. I looked up a place to go have sushi on Google and I hit what I thought was the reservation interface. And when we got to the restaurant the person there said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, where\u2019s your father?\u00e2\u0080\u009d And I was like, \u2018What are you talking about?\u2019 because it was just me and my mom. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, the really nice man who made the reservation.\u00e2\u0080\u009d And then I realized that Google Assistant made the reservation for us. And it was such a natural and friendly conversation that the person who took the reservation didn\u2019t realize it.</p>\n<p>And that kind of power inside a game character just unlocks a whole new level of immersion and storytelling that\u2019s really exciting. I mean, I love that about MMOs. Obviously, a lot of my work has been in action/adventure games where story is a big part of it. And so to unlock that storytelling capacity and realistic, believable characters is just super exciting for game developers.</p>\n<p><strong>Lauren</strong>: Talk to me about how that unlocks this next level storytelling. How does it differ from the current crop of worldbuilding games?</p>\n<p><strong>Jade</strong>: Typically, when you go talk to NPCs in games\u00e2\u0080\u0094non-player characters\u00e2\u0080\u0094there\u2019s a certain set of canned answers or things that that character will be able to say. And that\u2019s limited by how many options a writer can write in terms of believable script, and then how many lines you can record with an actor. All of those things have limits. So the experience that you have as a gamer is, the characters that you encounter will often repeat the same things multiple times, if you go back. There\u2019s no adjustment to those things.</p>\n<p>And so with these AI models that we have, we could put some basic objectives and behaviors inside the AI models. Then they could respond to things that you\u2019ve done in a game in a realistic way.</p>\n<p><strong>Jon</strong>: as you were saying that, I was thinking of \u00e2\u0080\u009cAssassin\u2019s Creed.\u00e2\u0080\u009d And you know how in the \u00e2\u0080\u009cAssassin\u2019s Creed\u00e2\u0080\u009d world you have so many NPCs milling around. The concept of having each of those NPCs controlled by an AI that remembers what the last thing you did was, the last time you\u2019ve spoken with them. Maybe they\u2019ve heard of things that you\u2019ve done in far-off cities from their neighbors and they react dynamically. That feels really mind-blowing in terms of the next evolution of these virtual worlds or these open-world games. And it makes complete sense, in terms of making the user experiences more lifelike. If you robbed a store last week, and then you come back inside that store today, well, people should react differently to you, right? [laughs] Like, they\u2019d be scared of you, maybe\u2026</p>\n<p><strong>Jade</strong>: Absolutely. Even better, a wanted poster of you should be on the wall. [laughs]</p>\n<p><strong>Jon</strong>: Right. That way the world feels dynamic. It\u2019s reacting to things that you do. It\u2019s not that dissimilar from \u00e2\u0080\u009cWestworld,\u00e2\u0080\u009d for example, that HBO show where you come in and everything adapts to the choices that you make as a character.</p>\n<p><strong>Jade</strong>: I think that\u2019s one of the ultimate dreams, creating that kind of experience. And we\u2019re on the verge of being able to do that kind of thing. We certainly are there in terms of graphics fidelity. And those are the types of things that wave two of cloud gaming unlocks. You can have distributed physics across the cloud, so there\u2019s no more limitations on how that behaves. That creates a ton of immersion game play, but also just dynamic weather and the persistence in a world and having that kind of recognition. I don\u2019t know if you remember the Nemesis system that was introduced a few years ago and was hugely popular. We can imagine what\u2019s the next-gen version of a Nemesis system, where there is memory from all kinds of characters and we take the limits off of that, as well.</p>\n<p><strong>Lauren</strong>: I want to talk about using AI not only as a creation tool, but also in terms of identity. How does AI also enable you to more fully express yourself within these game worlds?</p>\n<p><strong>Jade</strong>: We\u2019re in the age of self-expression. Whether we\u2019re talking about a game as a social platform or traditional social platforms, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re all about sharing something about ourselves. We all want to show who we are with the world and get recognition for that. Even if you think about the trends in fashion, people want to go to Nike to design their <em>own</em> shoes. Everyone wants to put their stamp on things.</p>\n<p>And so I really think the more that we can create these tools that help people express themselves and share something about themselves, the stronger and more sticky and more enriching, really, that interaction is going be.</p>\n<p>And I think there were the beginnings of this when you think about \u00e2\u0080\u009cLeft 4 Dead\u00e2\u0080\u009d and the AI director pacing the game and understanding what makes a game fun, and the ups and downs. Well, what can we do in terms of AI directors on a global scale to create that fun and to personalize that, as well? So maybe my version of a great game is action, action, action all the time. And maybe Jonathan prefers to grow some vegetables or whatever and go collect some ore and craft. I don\u2019t know what kind of player you are. [laughs] The AI director could personalize that as well.</p>\n<p><strong>Jon</strong>: To your point, if you\u2019re watched the movie \u00e2\u0080\u009cIron Man,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I\u2019ve always thought that what was the best part\u00e2\u0080\u0094the most valuable asset\u00e2\u0080\u0094is not the Iron Man suit, it\u2019s actually J.A.R.V.I.S, the AI, which helps Tony Stark create that suit. Because in that movie Tony just tells J.A.R.V.I.S the design that he wants, right? It\u2019s like, \u00e2\u0080\u009cHey, I want a suit that\u2019s made of titanium, and put the flux capacitors in the wrists.\u00e2\u0080\u009d And then J.A.R.V.I.S figures out how to actually make it. He goes and gets the materials and 3D builds it.</p>\n<p>And so having J.A.R.V.I.S in our world\u00e2\u0080\u0094some set of AI assistants or set of creator tools so someone can just focus on what they want\u00e2\u0080\u0094would be game-changing in terms of enabling storytellers to spend more time being creative, thinking about design, versus the minutia of implementation. It\u2019s where the bulk of time and money goes right now in game development, as opposed to that early brainstorming design and conception phase.</p>\n<p><strong>Jade:</strong> And then how do we use AI to amplify the talents that players have. So maybe I\u2019m not great at drawing or painting or I don\u2019t know how to 3D model or program. But through natural language processing, I can describe what I want and we can use machine learning to create the 3D rendition of that and amplify what I said. I think that would be an incredibly fulfilling experience and a way for people to share who they are beyond just avatars. They could really create a whole environment that represents them that they can share with people.</p>\n<p><strong>Jon</strong>: I think it\u2019s the ultimate form of the demonetization of content creation\u00e2\u0080\u0094the idea that anyone can become a creator with the help of the AI or a suite of AI assistance tools. And I think it also might be a requirement for building something like the \u00e2\u0080\u009cYouTube for gaming,\u00e2\u0080\u009d because in order to have enough of a content library, you need more creators out there than just a number of full-time professional developers making these games inside big companies.</p>\n<p><strong>Lauren</strong>: Yeah, talking about some of the challenges of building cloud-native games, it takes a really long time and it\u2019s really expensive to build out some of these content libraries, right? So is the answer to that the concurrent rise of user-generated content and AI?</p>\n<p><strong>Jade</strong>: I do think so. Ultimately, I think that\u2019s how we\u2019re going to get the best content, as well.</p>\n<p><strong>Jon</strong>: Maybe that\u2019s actually the path to the Metaverse that people talk about but it happens piecemeal, with everyone creating content as opposed to any one single company creating this huge, virtual world that people go in. It\u2019s actually the entire world working together with an AI to create that Metaverse.</p>\n<p><strong>Jade</strong>: And when we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re talking about the killer feature of cloud-native, the fact that we\u2019re landing on UGC as being a big part of it is really key here. Not only because people want to express themselves and share an identity. But also, from a technical standpoint that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s something that really hasn\u2019t been possible before. Because how do you constantly update a world? How do you keep things updated? I\u2019ve created my part, and then how is that reflected in your game if I want to share it? So all of this happening on the cloud makes those things that weren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t possible before, especially on mobile, to be shared experiences and shared worlds.</p>\n<p><strong>Lauren</strong>: So what are some of the social capabilities that the cloud enables that we haven\u2019t seen yet? What does that look like?</p>\n<p><strong>Jon</strong>: It feels like when people think about social in cloud gaming, the first thing that they gravitate toward is the removal of concurrency caps on player accounts with multiplayer games. And so, just using Fortnite as an example, Fortnite is a cutting-edge piece of software, but it\u2019s still limited to just 100 players in an instance. A lot of that\u2019s just limited by what your client-side processing is capable of keeping track and of and rendering.</p>\n<p>And so a lot of folks are excited about cloud gaming because they think, \u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, well, what if you had thousand-person battle royale or a one-million-person battle royale that took place over days, if not weeks? And so this feels like the first iteration of what folks think of when they think of next-gen social in cloud gaming.</p>\n<p><strong>Lauren</strong>: Should it be that big? Should we be having 1,000-person battle royales?</p>\n<p><strong>Jade</strong>: I\u2019m not convinced that thousand-person battle royales are going to be the best thing. I think an MMO could be a place where the more people, the better.</p>\n<p>So I\u2019m going get into a bit of theory here about network design, because this is really where I see the best answer to your question. If you think about a network where people are the nodes and the links between a network are the interactions. Typically in network theory, networks with a lot of weak links grow much bigger. So for example, that\u2019s why you\u2019ll have more people following you on a Twitter than a Facebook. Those are much lighter ways to interact. And so when we think about cloud gaming and designing the IPs of the future, I think it\u2019s leveraging all of those different types of interactions. So we talked about a lot of very deep links of interaction, right? That\u2019s me creating my own world where other people come join me. That\u2019s a very involved thing. Then let\u2019s say we\u2019re making a shooter game. Actually being the person who has a controller or is playing on mouse and keyboard, that\u2019s also a pretty deep connection. On the other end of it, you have the watchers who are now, for the most part, even with live streaming, disconnected. Sometimes there\u2019s chatting and impacting it. But that\u2019s a light connection. We\u2019re starting to see, only through the text, the impact bleeding through.</p>\n<p>And I think cloud gaming wave two opens up that full spectrum of interaction, which means that you can really grow an IP or a platform or a social network to be a much more powerful network because you can enable those light ways of interaction.</p>\n<p><strong>Lauren</strong>: So what is the benefit of that lighter touch?</p>\n<p><strong>Jade</strong>: It\u2019s accessibility. It\u2019s accommodating different ways of play for different moods, as well. Probably when I\u2019ve carved out two hours to be in front of my TV and I really want to be immersed, I\u2019m looking for one experience. When I\u2019m on my phone standing in line somewhere, I want a different type of experience.</p>\n<p>So it\u2019s both to address mood, but also accessibility. I think a good example of this is when you think about the \u00e2\u0080\u009cStar Wars\u00e2\u0080\u009d franchise. It\u2019s a great model of an IP that\u2019s an entertainment network. Because I can just get a little Yoda sticker, and I\u2019m somehow involved. But that\u2019s a very lightweight way to be involved, right? [laughs] All the way to: I can be creating fan fiction within the franchise.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, the benefit of that for players is that I can feel included no matter what my device is, my skill level, my time availability. I can participate. I don\u2019t have to feel like I\u2019m left out from my friends who are gaming or left out of the experience. And I think from the point of view of creators, you can reach a lot more people and create much more rich experiences.</p>\n<p><strong>Jon</strong>: Regardless of what device you\u2019re on, what mood you\u2019re in, your game play experience should be able to adapt to your personal setting and your desires and moods and device. And I think that\u2019s only made possible with something like a cloud-native game that lives in the internet that has access to all of the data on you, where you are, what device you\u2019re on. If you combine that with something like the AI director, that ensures that everyone has their own personal journey when they\u2019re entering a world or a game and that it\u2019s a good experience, as well.</p>\n<p><strong>Jade</strong>: I also read your article talking about <a href=\"https://a16z.com/2020/09/01/tabletop-games-go-digital/\">people coming back to play D&amp;D</a>. You know, there aren\u2019t very many great DMs\u00c2\u00a0in the world. And maybe that limits the amount of people who can enjoy that kind of story. So that\u2019s something that an AI director could be taught to do and learn. And actually, we could probably through ML create the best DMs on the planet, right? They could learn what\u2019s most entertaining, what makes a great story, and how to react on the fly to people\u2019s reactions.</p>\n<p><strong>Jon</strong>: If that could be crowd-sourced somehow, I think it opens up the audience way, way, way more massively than it is now, where you actually have to find someone to physically come over and DM the game.</p>\n<p><strong>Jade</strong>: Yeah, and what you\u2019re talking about really is also the magic that makes that experience personal and worth sharing. And \u00e2\u0080\u009cworth sharing\u00e2\u0080\u009d is a term that we use a lot as a guiding direction with our game dev teams. Either sharing in the moment with multiple people, or it\u2019s so personal and so unique that it\u2019s worth sharing even if it\u2019s a single player experience. Because if my version of the experience is exactly yours then there\u2019s no point in me sharing it with you. You\u2019re going to say, \u00e2\u0080\u009cYeah, I got through that level.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Maybe it was slightly different, but it\u2019s more or less the same. The more we can enable these experiences, the more personal they are to you, therefore more meaningful and more engaging. But also the more they\u2019re worth sharing.</p>\n<p><strong>Jon</strong>: One of the unique things about video games, as well, is that it\u2019s one of the only forms of entertainment that dynamically generates video as it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s consumed. If you listen to music, that\u2019s not the case. If you read a book, that\u2019s not the case. You\u2019re just consuming it. But with video games, the act of playing it generates clips that can be shared virally over Reddit and Twitch and YouTube and so on. And so this is really leaning into the unique strength of the medium as a video generator as well, which, to your point, is immensely shareable.</p>\n<p><strong>Jade</strong>: And then all kinds of things can have different effects on that video generation. Which means that my particular experience is not only me and personalized, but the moment in time and how everyone else interacted with it then too.</p>\n<p><strong>Lauren</strong>: Do you feel that that unlocks more interactivity between players who haven\u2019t interacted before? Does it open up the experience to more spontaneous interactions among strangers, as it becomes bigger and as it becomes more open?</p>\n<p><strong>John</strong>: If you think about how we actually socialize in the real world, pre-pandemic, it\u2019s common for you to just say to a friend, \u00e2\u0080\u009cHey, let\u2019s meet up at a bar or at a shopping mall.\u00e2\u0080\u009d And you meet up with them and you don\u2019t necessarily have this agenda that\u2019s planned out, right? It\u2019s more like: we\u2019re gonna meet up at the mall and then we\u2019re just going to hang out and wander around. Maybe we\u2019ll meet some people and then we\u2019ll go home in time for dinner.</p>\n<p>What is the digital equivalent of that? People point to video games, but the reality is that most video games today are very purposeful. It\u2019s like, I will call you up in Discord and say, \u00e2\u0080\u009cHey, let\u2019s go play \u00e2\u0080\u0098Baldur\u2019s Gate 3.\u2019\u00e2\u0080\u009d And then we\u2019ll meet up and then we\u2019ll play Baldur\u2019s Gate 3 for two hours and then we\u2019ll adjourn. In a cloud-native gaming world, is it possible to have the dominant social modality actually shift closer to what it\u2019s like in the real world? Where I\u2019m just saying to you, \u00e2\u0080\u009cJade, let\u2019s go to XYZ place\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u0094that YouTube of games, for example. And then we\u2019ll just wander, but it\u2019s not planned out. It\u2019s not purposeful.</p>\n<p><strong>Jade</strong>: I think that\u2019s the vision of the Metaverse that many of us have been wanting to see coming for years. I actually was at a startup in 2000 that was trying to make the Metaverse back in the first dot com boom. [laughs] It is one of those things that you can finally see happening now with cloud gaming</p>\n<p>You don\u2019t have to worry about the downloads. You don\u2019t have to worry about the load times. You don\u2019t have to worry about the simulation or the processing power of the device that you\u2019re on. And you could have that experience of just hanging out and wandering with a really smart, personalized playlist for you and your friend. Or you could maybe input your mood at the time and the playlist could be adapted: \u201cOh, the other time they were in the mood for that, this is kind of the type of thing that they liked experiencing.\u00e2\u0080\u009d That\u2019s the holy grail of where we get to at some point.</p>\n<p><strong>Lauren</strong>: Jade, you mentioned you were at a startup trying to build this vision back in 2000. A question for both of you is: why is that concept of cloud-native gaming so daunting? What are some of the challenges developers face today when building cloud-native games?</p>\n<p><strong>Jon</strong>: My guess is that in the first attempts at making cloud-native games, you don\u2019t actually know what\u2019s going to work. You\u00e2\u0080\u0099re sort of experimenting in this giant gray box. And so talking to folks early on last year, when Stadia first launched, I think a lot of developers were very excited about \u00e2\u0080\u009cbigger is better.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Let\u2019s make 1,000-person battle royales. And they were very excited about the possibility of making ultra-realistic graphics. Okay, we\u2019re going make characters that are so realistic that you can see every hair on their face, powered by racks of supercomputers. And the fallacy of all of this is that they were taking what worked in the last paradigm, which is the console generations, where you had more and more powerful hardware and that enables better graphics and enables more people to play together, and then they\u2019re applying that to the cloud. But what they\u2019re not getting is that the stuff that\u2019s actually going to be unique to the cloud is actually a complete reimagination of these paradigms of gaming. But it\u2019s taken a while to figure that out.</p>\n<p><strong>Lauren</strong>: That\u2019s something that has kind of run through this whole conversation. We talk about how we\u2019re in phase one of cloud-native gaming and we\u2019re reaching for phase two. Jon, I remember in your post you said you thought we\u2019d see the first cloud-native games hit the market in two or three years. That was a year ago. How far out are we from that vision?</p>\n<p><strong>Jon</strong>: It feels like we\u2019re still early. But people are experimenting, and I\u2019m excited to see the first games hit the market hopefully in the next year or two.</p>\n<p><strong>Jade</strong>: Yeah, I don\u2019t think of it as being, like, bam! we\u2019re going to be in wave two and we\u2019re all going to be like, <em>whoa</em>. I think we\u2019re going to slowly see the cloud native features be introduced and realize we\u2019re kind of going to have these different little moments of epiphany. Like, \u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, okay, I get it. That\u2019s cool. That really changes things.\u00e2\u0080\u009d I think we\u2019re starting to see some of those things now. Some of the features that we\u2019ve integrated with YouTube in terms of crowd play and crowd choice that you can be queuing to play or comment and impact the creator or streamer\u2019s game. That\u2019s starting to do some cloud interaction and bleeding into the wave one. We\u2019re going to start to see the games with procedural generation, or physics simulation, or number of players that are going to be, 10x\u2019ing what\u2019s possible in local hardware probably in the two or so year range. I think if someone is going to say, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe\u2019re going after the \u2018Westworld\u2019 vision,\u00e2\u0080\u009d that\u2019s probably a six-year vision to deliver, I\u2019d say. [laughs] You know, with a lot of resources.</p>\n<p><strong>Lauren</strong>: That\u2019s actually a little scary: six years to \u00e2\u0080\u009cWestworld.\u00e2\u0080\u009d [laughs] That\u2019s\u2026</p>\n<p><strong>Jade</strong>: [laughs] Well it would maybe a janky \u00e2\u0080\u009cWestworld.\u00e2\u0080\u009d</p>\n<p><strong>Jon</strong>: I can\u2019t wait. 5G is being deployed globally right now. I think that\u2019s also extremely exciting for the potential impact on mobile gaming because you can essentially now stream 1080p HD quality video to your phone as you\u2019re commuting, as you\u2019re jogging, as you\u2019re waiting in line for your sandwich. I think that opens up a whole new world.</p>\n<p><strong>Lauren</strong>: Following onto your point, Jade, what is your vision for the gaming landscape in five years then? How do we see this evolving? And which trends are emerging that you anticipate becoming more influential in the space?</p>\n<p><strong>Jade</strong>: It really is <a href=\"https://a16z.com/2019/11/02/come-for-the-games-stay-for-the-party/\">games as the new social platform</a>. That\u2019s number one. More and more, we\u2019re seeing the needs of players in a game as \u00e2\u0080\u009cmy place to hang out.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Right? It\u2019s not just my entertainment. It\u2019s my loved pastime. It\u2019s my subculture. It\u2019s the identity of my community. With those needs, how do we deliver something that wasn\u2019t possible before?</p>\n<p>I\u2019ve never worked at Nintendo, but I do feel that looking at their approach to creating new hardware, from an outside observer\u2019s opinion, it seems like they take a really user-first needs approach. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOkay, you know, we recognize a need for the family to have a pastime to do together. Families have fun when they get to move, right?\u00e2\u0080\u009d And that\u2019s when the Wii gets designed and a whole suite of games that sold really well and outdid the conventional thinking of: we just want more processing power or whatever.</p>\n<p>And I think the proof point is something we talked about earlier, which is \u00e2\u0080\u009cAmong Us\u00e2\u0080\u009d being the hit, \u00e2\u0080\u009cFall Guys\u00e2\u0080\u009d being the big hit. Now we\u2019re in this really exciting year where all of these big hits are coming from these small indie developers, you know, three people or new teams. And it shows that people on the pulse of what the new generation of gamers want are really going to be able to make the things that are most meaningful.</p>\n<p><strong>Jon</strong>: It also feels like in games there\u2019s been an acceleration of new hits. \u00e2\u0080\u009cFortnite\u00e2\u0080\u009d was a hit back in 2018. And then before \u00e2\u0080\u009cFortnite\u00e2\u0080\u009d I think the last big hit that reached a similar level of scale was probably \u00e2\u0080\u009cPokemon GO,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and that was, like 2015 or \u201916. So there was like two or three years between those hits.</p>\n<p>But if you look at what\u2019s happened over the last year, we\u2019ve had three, four major hits that have had tens of millions of people playing. \u00e2\u0080\u009cFall Guys,\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cAmong Us.\u00e2\u0080\u009d There was \u00e2\u0080\u009cApex Legends\u00e2\u0080\u009d and the whole the auto-chess phenomenon that came out last year.</p>\n<p><strong>Jade</strong>: Yeah, it\u2019s part of games really being <a href=\"https://a16z.com/2019/11/02/come-for-the-games-stay-for-the-party/\">part of pop culture now</a>. I think that\u2019s a fundamental shift that\u2019s happened, as well. Whereas that was always the case for music, for example, right? If you wanted to be cool with your groups of friends, you had to know about the latest rap track or the latest K-pop band. And games are so widely played by everyone now, especially in the younger generations, that you also need this as social currency.</p>\n<p>If you\u2019re a creator, obviously you need it as social currency to stay on the edge of being in the know. But even as a player, you need to talk about that. And so it\u2019s really an interesting phenomenon and shift when a medium goes from being for \u00e2\u0080\u009ccore\u00e2\u0080\u009d to being something that everyone cares about.</p>\n<p><strong>Jon</strong>: I think what struck me the most about \u00e2\u0080\u009cAmong Us\u00e2\u0080\u009d was the diversity of people playing it and also tweeting about it on social media. You have older folks that you wouldn\u2019t ordinarily identify as gamers. You know, my wife is a big fan of \u00e2\u0080\u009cAmong Us\u00e2\u0080\u009d and she plays it bi-weekly with a circle of moms where they vent about their kids while playing \u00e2\u0080\u009cAmong Us.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The sheer diversity of these people who are now gamers, I think it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an inflexion point for the industry. It\u2019s no longer just little kids playing in their basements. Everyone\u2019s a gamer.</p>\n<p><strong>Jade</strong>: Yeah, and that\u2019s exciting to me. Because I do have stereotypical core-gamer tastes, I do like a good action game, personally. But I\u2019m very excited about being able to make games for different audiences and amplifying the voices of new creators with different perspectives. And so hopefully there will be a game made especially for moms who want to vent about their kids who are playing in the background, right? [laughs] Cool. Like, why not?</p>\n<p><strong>Jon</strong>: And let\u2019s not forget that we also have concerts and birthday parties in \u00e2\u0080\u009cFortnite\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009cRoblox.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Is that the beginning of a new wave where there are actually events that are better held in a virtual world than in real life? What are the other events that might spawn from a similar concept? You know, is it political fundraisers? [laughs] Is it schools?</p>\n<p><strong>Jade</strong>: Absolutely. I think the whole area of events and performance and what that means virtually\u00e2\u0080\u0094live, real time performance\u00e2\u0080\u0094is really, really exciting. I also think there are certain ways that virtual can unlock things in a better way. I mean, we always think about the downsides. But there\u2019s also a lot of benefits to doing things virtually.</p>\n<p>As we think of some of the new constraints that we have in the world and spending more of our time on screens or in virtual social environments, there are ways to think: okay, maybe a virtual concert or a virtual performance or a virtual class can be even more fulfilling.</p>\n<p><strong>Lauren</strong>: To be determined. Well thank you both so much for joining us on the a16z podcast. It\u2019s been such a pleasure.</p>\n<p><strong>Jade</strong>: Thank you, Lauren. It\u2019s been great.</p>\n<p><strong>Jon</strong>: Thank you.</p>\n<div class=\"download-cta\"><div class=\"inner\"><h2>Everything you thought you knew about social networks is getting reinvented.</h2><p>Our new series, Social Strikes Back, explores the hyper-social future of consumer tech.</p><a class=\"btn btn-orange\" href=\"https://a16z.com/social-strikes-back\">See more</a></div></div>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\">***</p>\n<p><em>The views expressed here are those of the individual AH Capital Management, L.L.C.

I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m Hanne, and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m here today with Michael Ovitz, co-founder of the Creative Artists Agency, and our own Ben Horowitz, co-founder of Andreessen Horowitz. In this episode, we start by talking about the founding story of both CAA and a16z, and how exactly both firms went about redefining a traditional business, in two different industries, as a new upstart.<br/>\nWe talk about the power equation in Hollywood, from the history of the entertainment business from the days of vaudeville and the Jack Warners and William Foxes to Jurassic Park, to what it looks like today and where it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going.<br/>\nAnd along the way, Ovitz and Horowitz share the strategies that guided them, in building a culture, negotiation and more.<br/>\nMichael has published a new book just out, \u201cWho is Michael Ovitz.\u00e2\u0080\u009d</em></p>\n<p>Ben: Is that like a reference to like Keyser Soze?</p>\n<p>Michael: How do you know?</p>\n<p>Ben: You\u2019re one of the few people that knows who Keyser Soze is.</p>\n<p>Michael: I met Ben in 1999 when he and Marc asked me to go on the board of Loud Cloud. And I told a lot of stories about the entertainment business, about the\u00e2\u0080\u00a6</p>\n<p>Ben: Oh, good. The print stories, the rain man stories.</p>\n<p>Michael: So, I have to say I wake up and they\u2019re talking about starting their own business and possibly using some of those principles, and I was in a state of shock that they actually listened to the stories.</p>\n<p>Ben: CAA was really an impossible thing, in that if you looked at the agency business, it had been around since vaudeville, and the firms were well established. And if you\u2019re a new actress and you\u2019re picking an agency, are you gonna go with the one who like repped Betty Davis and, Gretta Garbo and all the greats, or are you gonna go with some new start? What is the differentiation? Like, how could you possibly pull that off?</p>\n<p>And the fact that he was able to create by far, the most successful talent agency in the world 15 years after starting, 75 years after vaudeville, is an impossible business story. We come from tech where like, okay, you can turn something over because the technology changes, but this was not a technology story. It was one of organizational design culture, and things that turned out we\u2019d use in venture capital.</p>\n<p>Hanne: I thought what was really interesting is that you were fundamentally reconceiving the idea of the agent, what it should be. But in some ways you were returning to an old fashioned idea of what an agent was.</p>\n<p>Michael: Yeah, I think that\u2019s really well said. We tried to ride a line between going back to the tradition of service, but couple it with the concept of putting the talent back in the driver\u2019s seat because they\u2019d been taken out of the driver\u2019s seat. The ability to get product made in the business, or to realize dreams, was in the hands of the buyers. And when we started, there was a very large barrier to entry in the media business. Anything that you would read, or see, or hear was controlled by under 25 companies around the world.</p>\n<p>You had four television networks in the United States. You had seven motion picture studios that had all of the distribution, and without that you couldn\u2019t get your movie in a theater. You had five publishing houses in New York that did books. You had about five record companies, and then a scattered number of companies in Europe that had television networks but not a lot.</p>\n<p>So, basically, if you were an artist, you had a giant barrier to entry. It\u2019s the opposite of today, which is so fascinating to me that today, and Ben and I talk about this all the time, you could get almost, look you can get this podcast on.</p>\n<p>Ben: It\u2019s very popular.</p>\n<p>Michael: And you can get people to listen to it. In the days when we started, that was impossible. If we wanted to get something like this out into the hands of the consumer, there was no way to do it.</p>\n<p>Hanne: Incredibly powerful, very few gate keepers.</p>\n<p>Michael: Right. So, basically, we decided that we would give a unique and ultra-deep service to creative people. We coupled that with an enormous amount of guidance and career advice that was incredibly direct. We were less concerned about telling people things they didn\u2019t wanna hear. We were actually more concerned about telling them things that they didn\u2019t wanna hear. We thought, too long, artistic people had been given a lot of pabulum.</p>\n<p>Hanne: Ben, when you were looking at this model, what was it that really struck you from this other industry that felt so translatable?</p>\n<p>Ben: The whole thing. It\u2019s actually funny. Everything that we tried from CAA worked, and\u00e2\u0080\u00a6</p>\n<p>Hanne: Everything?</p>\n<p>Ben: All the core principles. So, the first was this concept of a network. So, you know, a firm shouldn\u2019t be just a group of independent people who all had their own isolated networks. The network should be owned and run by the entity itself. And CAA was a breakthrough in this because you had people who were dedicated to vertical parts of the network, like publishing. And so that, of course, we did as you know our networks were different but it was the same kind of systematic network that turned the platform into a franchise.</p>\n<p>The other thing was they took pitching the clients much more seriously, the agencies were very powerful, they didn\u2019t have to put together like a great presentation to the clients about what they did. I think we\u2019re for sure, the first, and maybe still the only venture capital firm that has a pitch to entrepreneurs that\u2019s, you know, formal and professional, and involves lots of people. So that worked.</p>\n<p>But I would say the thing that I learned the most from more were the cultural things that Michael\u2019s talking about. So, do you tell people the truth not what they wanna hear? That\u2019s like one of the cultural tenets of the firm. But there were many others. To take a long view or a transactional view of a relationship, that came from CAA. A lot of the idea of the platform was to have the luxury to take a long view of our relationship.</p>\n<p>Things like, how do you treat people in the firm? Everybody here, we refer to as \u2018Partner.\u2019 That was taken from CAA. We got a lot of criticism of that early. But it worked well because we\u2019re in the services industry and \u201cLook, if you\u2019re representing the firm, you are partner.\u201d</p>\n<p>And then, you know, the other thing was honest but respectful. So, you know, showing up on time, being ahead of the competition. They did something at CAA which is they just started their staff meeting before everybody else and that just said to the company, \u201cYou know, we\u2019re not F-ing around. Like, we\u2019re gonna get this done. We\u2019re gonna be the first awake. We\u2019re gonna be the last to sleep, and we\u2019re gonna get all the best clients.\u201d And that\u2019s what they did.</p>\n<p>Hanne: I mean, it did strike me that a lot of those big conceptual shifts were about culture. You talked about things like a focus on first impressions, a siege mentality, like, you\u2019re with us or against us. Never bad mouth the competition, right? The sort of core things that trickle down in all kinds of ways.</p>\n<p>But some of what you were doing was actual business model innovation also. Can we talk about what those things were that were so different for the industry?</p>\n<p>Michael: So, I think it\u2019s important to note, the idea was to differentiate. So, one of the things when Ben and I and Marc talked originally, was there\u2019s several hundred VC firms that have been in existence for a long time. When we came into the agency business there were 200 franchised agencies and we were\u00e2\u0080\u00a6</p>\n<p>Hanne: New kid on the block.</p>\n<p>Michael: This new kid on the block with nothing, no clients. How do you make a name for yourself by other than just saying, \u201cOh, we\u2019re fantastic\u201d? Which is irrelevant, because everyone thinks they\u2019re fantastic even though they know deep down they\u2019re not.</p>\n<p>But the reality is that it was about differentiation, and how can you make yourself different? And we decided we were gonna create a service model that was completely different. If you\u2019re an entrepreneur, you come here, you have access to things that you didn\u2019t have at a lot of other places in the community, and that would include budget help, you can get marketing help, you can get PR help, you can get advice about how to operate your business. You\u2019ve got a built-in person to get operational advice on. You\u2019ve got extraordinary technical background, so you can get technical advice.</p>\n<p>I view what we did very much like a pointillist painting, like the painter Seurat. If you look at a square inch of a pointillist painting, you see a bunch of dots. You look at two square inches, you see a few more dots, three, four, five, and all the sudden, maybe at six or eight square inches you start to see a picture.</p>\n<p>So, I think what we tried to do, is look at our business like a pointillist painting, which is how many points of differentiation are there that create a full picture? Within the culture there\u2019s all these little things. There are just all these little things. There\u2019s no one thing, Hanne, that you can say, \u201cMy God, you guys called everybody a partner, that\u2019s really a game changer.\u201d</p>\n<p>Hanne: It\u2019s a composite, yeah.</p>\n<p>Michael: It\u2019s a composite of looking at a pointillist picture. On the business principle side, it was the same thing. So, this sounds ridiculous, but telling someone the truth, it seems so logically normal. It was completely abnormal in the business we were in in 1974. It didn\u2019t exist. Knowledge was power, but people felt they had to lie to show that they had knowledge.</p>\n<p>Hanne: And what were those kinds of lies? Just, \u201cYou\u2019re great. I can get you that\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u201d What were the actual\u00e2\u0080\u00a6?</p>\n<p>Michael: Empty flattery. That\u2019s not what people are interested in. People wanna know the truth. They wanna be critiqued. And They want positive criticism. They don\u2019t want you to tear them apart without something to say that\u2019s constructive. They want constructive, positive critique.</p>\n<p>Hanne: In fact, you say that\u2019s where you often started, when you were trying to sign somebody.</p>\n<p>Michael: Well, it was easier to tell the truth. Like, the truth is a funny thing in entertainment.</p>\n<p>Ben: It\u2019s easier to remember, yeah.</p>\n<p>Michael: The entertainment business is loaded with untruths. The TV business, less so, because everything was so fast. You could start a television idea and get it made into a show very quickly. But in movies, it\u2019s years to get a movie made and released. And the amount of story changes in, not the story of the movie but the story around the story of the movie, is quite extraordinary.</p>\n<p>We pioneered this concept of I don\u2019t know the answer to that question, but I\u2019m gonna get back to you.\u201d Now, that\u2019s no big deal, right? But that\u2019s part of the composite. It\u2019s part of the hundreds and thousands of points that we did to be different.</p>\n<p>Hanne: So let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s shift gears again from culture and towards the business models. What are more of some of those ways you were really doing something new on the business model side.</p>\n<p>Michael: In the construction of business concepts, we felt that no client should come up with an idea and go out and make it on their own, with that idea standing on its own in the marketplace. We felt that in-house, we should take that idea like a lump of clay on a table and sculpt it into a magnificent sculpture that was a composite of a lot of elements, other clients input and partnerships that gave us a full package, and really use that leverage against the buyer to be able to play the game of, \u201cYou didn\u2019t put in any time or money to develop this. We did, so we wanna be paid a premium.\u201d</p>\n<p>Now, that worked really well for the creative clients. It did not make us popular.</p>\n<p>Ben: There is some controversy around you, and a lot of it came from\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 prior to CAA, a top actor or actress made maybe a 10th or a 20th of what they did, or maybe even a 50th of what they did after CAA because you changed the leverage from the studio to the talent.</p>\n<p>And that was not free, you know, and so maybe describe what it was like, how you changed it, and why they were mad.</p>\n<p>Michael: So, I think\u00e2\u0080\u00a6I don\u2019t know that mad\u00e2\u0080\u00a6it\u2019s interesting, I used to think that, and I think it\u2019s more we did so many things that were positive for the creative community, but we coupled it with this relentless aggressive attitude and this point of view that we had to win at all costs.</p>\n<p>The big question for me was did we have to win at all costs? At the time, I actually thought we did. Someone asked me the other day, \u201cDo you think you could have done it differently in the day?\u201d And I don\u2019t think that we could have, because we were in a cutthroat business to start with. We didn\u2019t invent the entertainment business. It was a cutthroat\u00e2\u0080\u00a6</p>\n<p>Ben: Notoriously, yeah.</p>\n<p>Michael: It\u2019s notoriously cutthroat. It wasn\u2019t a gentleman\u2019s business. My God, if you go back to the moguls of the 30s, 40s, and 50s, the Mayors, the Thurmans, the Harry Collins, the Jack Warners of Warner Brothers, William Fox of, you know, who founded Fox Studios. These guys were tough as nails. They took no prisoners. They made us look like we were in the priesthood, frankly.</p>\n<p>Now, to me, past is prologue. So, in studying all of this I actually thought that the toughness of those guys was good.</p>\n<p>Hanne: Because, why?</p>\n<p>Michael: Well, they were decisive You may not like the answers, but they give you answers. And they were doers. When Diller decided to create \u201cThe Movie of The Week\u201d on ABC, which everyone said is a terrible idea and impossible, you can\u2019t make a movie for 90 minutes for a million dollars, and he said, \u201cWatch me,\u201d and he did it, that kind of attitude impresses me. And helped me think really hard and heavy about what we would do at CAA.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s 45 years later, it\u2019s still working. So something worked. Now, could we have backed off and been softer and gentler probably a bit all the way? I don\u2019t think so.</p>\n<p>Not in the business we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re in.</p>\n<p>Hanne: Can you walk us through how that would play out on a daily level as you were actually making these deals?</p>\n<p>Michael: Take a movie that you put together, let\u2019s just take one, \u201cJurassic Park.\u201d Michael Crighton said, \u201cI\u2019ve got this idea about something that I\u2019ve always loved. It\u2019s paleontology. It\u2019s dinosaurs. But not in a prehistoric, you\u2019re in a contemporary setting, and it\u2019s an amusement park run amuck. No movie stars.\u00e2\u0080\u009d</p>\n<p>And I said, \u201cMy God, everybody loves dinosaurs. Let\u2019s try to write this.\u201d So, he writes it. He gives it to me. I can\u2019t put it down. It\u2019s a page turner. We decide there is only one director that can do this. We give it to Steven Spielberg. He calls the next morning at six a.m. and says, \u201cI\u2019m doing this,\u201d after reading it. That\u2019s unheard of for a director of that stature to commit in 12 hours to a\u00e2\u0080\u00a6</p>\n<p>Hanne: I mean, to have read it that quickly, let alone\u00e2\u0080\u00a6</p>\n<p>Michael: Yeah. He gets it at six o\u2019clock at night and calls at six the next morning and says, \u201cI\u2019m in.\u201d Kathy Kennedy is the producer. She does a budget. You\u2019ve got a writer, you don\u2019t need movie stars, the star is the dinosaur. And you\u2019re sitting there and no one has this except us, you talk to Spielberg, you talk to Crighton, who would you like to finance and distribute it? Because frankly, it doesn\u2019t really matter, because it matters who\u2019s gonna write it and direct it, and we have that.</p>\n<p>So, they decide we should go to Universal, and for an opening salvo, you know, you call the president of the company and say, \u201cI have good news and bad news, the good news is we\u2019ve got Kathy Kennedy, and Steven Spielberg, and Michael Crighton, you know, with a detailed book that\u2019s gonna be a bestseller about dinosaurs, and we\u2019ve got a screenplay and it\u2019s gonna cost this much money.\u201d \u201cSo, what\u2019s a bad news?\u201d \u201cWell, we own it, and you don\u2019t.\u201d</p>\n<p>Now, take the six to eight other studios that don\u2019t get that phone call. They\u2019re not happy. Take the 30 directors, or 40 directors that didn\u2019t get it, they\u2019re not happy. Take the couple of hundred screenwriters that didn\u2019t get a shot at the book, they\u2019re not happy. Nobody\u2019s happy.</p>\n<p>Hanne: It reminds me, actually, when I first started as an editor and I was starting to say no to projects, there\u2019s a lot of relationship stuff that goes sour there too. And one of my colleagues said to me, \u201cYou\u2019re not doing your job right if people don\u2019t not like you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ben: No, then Michael, you did your job well.</p>\n<p>Michael: I guess I did my job well. Look, this is tough to say but, you know, I wasn\u2019t out to win a popularity contest.</p>\n<p>This was not high school, I started at the age of 27 in a business that had been around for 75, 80 years, kind of like playing hockey and skating down the ice, and the next thing you know, someone\u2019s stick is tripping you up and you\u2019re falling on your face on the ice. This was a tough game.</p>\n<p>Hanne: Let\u2019s talk a little bit about that culture that you built, that both of you built going from start up to a mature firm. Did those fundamental principles, or those pointillist dots, did they shift? Did the colors start shifting? Did things change?</p>\n<p>Michael: It\u2019s a living organism. It moves on a daily basis. You have these knobs, and it\u2019s endless, the number of knobs. There\u2019s a knob for everybody in the business. There\u2019s a knob for every deal. There\u2019s a knob for every principle. There\u2019s a knob for every service.</p>\n<p>Hanne: How do you stay the observing part when it\u2019s such a fluid living organism and there\u2019s so many dials?</p>\n<p>Michael: You sit with those knobs. I remember when we were at Loud Cloud when there were 400-plus employees and they had to take those knobs because the business model was changing.</p>\n<p>Ben: Yeah, all the knobs.</p>\n<p>Michael: And Ben sitting there at those knobs 24/7. And sometimes you over dial them, sometimes you under-dial them.</p>\n<p>Ben: Yeah. And you never get them entirely right. So many people like management consultants, or even CEOs, will talk about culture as though it\u2019s something they said they want and that was it.</p>\n<p>Hanne: Yeah.</p>\n<p>Ben: And that\u2019s never it. It\u2019s changing every day, and you have to pay attention to, as Michael said, to just sit back. And that you\u2019re really talking about how are people behaving when you\u2019re not looking.</p>\n<p>Do they return their calls? How do they treat their clients? All these kinds of things emanate from the culture of the organization. You have to observe the behaviors, you\u2019ve got to put in mechanisms, you\u2019ve got to turn things this way or that way. And, you know, some things don\u2019t work anymore. Some things you were wrong about. And so yeah, that\u2019s an evolving process.</p>\n<p>Michael: A perfect culture is a culture in constant flux and growth. Constant flux and growth.</p>\n<p>Ben: And the culture supports the strategy, so like you can\u2019t come in from the outside and know what the culture of somebody else\u2019s company should be, because you don\u2019t know which direction they\u2019re taking it. So, like an easy example is like, Amazon\u2019s got this culture of frugality because it\u2019s so important to them to be the low-cost provider.</p>\n<p>Good cultural element for Amazon. You can\u2019t put that in Apple. They\u2019re like high designs. Steve Jobs got fired because he made the product too expensive. But that\u2019s who they are. That\u2019s their strategy. Their culture has got to support their strategy. That\u2019s why you have a five billion dollar campus. Jeff Bezos will never build a five billion dollar campus because he doesn\u2019t care what the door knob looks like.</p>\n<p>Michael: It\u2019s why some businesses are fantastic and are run really in a phenomenal way, and others aren\u2019t. And the fish stinks from the head, you know? If the person who is operating the business and helping create the culture and bringing everybody together is on it 24/7, and I mean every day It never goes away out of your head.</p>\n<p>I used to walk around do the rounds. Like doctors at a hospital. I used to go in the late morning and in the late afternoon just to show my face, to see if I saw someone knotted up in their office, or to just get a sense of how people were feeling. I did it from the time we started where we had five people to the time when I left, when we had 700 people.</p>\n<p>Hanne: A thermometer read.</p>\n<p>Michael: And how do you get the read? You get it by \u201cFrame of Reference.\u201d You see the people enough on a daily basis, and you get a sense if there\u2019s somebody who\u2019s got a problem. Is it fun? Absolutely not. It\u2019s time consumptive, and to be human is to err. And to be human is to have a problem. Everyone had problems. And as someone who is like the gatherer of the culture, you\u2019re not allowed to have a problem. You have to solve everybody else\u2019s problem.</p>\n<p>So, it\u2019s not something you can do by yourself, by the way. I wanna be very clear that I did not do this by myself. I had a partner who was phenomenal at rounding this out, Ron Meyer. We would tell each other problems with individuals and then one of us would shore it up and then the other one would go in and take the temperature to see if it was shored up.</p>\n<p>I used to wonder every day when I went home, you know, where did I make a mistake today? You know, who did I tell some bad advice to? Which executive in the company did I let down, you know? And then when you get home say the same thing about your own kids.</p>\n<p>Ben: That is the one thing that is so dangerous when you\u2019re CEO, you have to be in this mindset that you\u2019re making decisions, you\u2019re hardnosed. You have high expectations of everybody. Your standard has to be very high, or it will slip for everyone. You take that attitude home, it\u2019s not good. That\u2019s not the way you need to be a parent. And it\u2019s a real challenge.</p>\n<p>Hanne: Yeah. You talked about trying to agent your children for a while, that was\u00e2\u0080\u00a6</p>\n<p>Michael: I would come home and sometimes not flip gears.</p>\n<p>Ben: Yeah.</p>\n<p>Michael: Sometimes I\u2019d come home and I didn\u2019t downshift, and I\u2019m talking to my kids like they\u2019re clients, believe me. Regrettable, but unfortunately, factually accurate.</p>\n<p>Hanne: Well, human.</p>\n<p>Ben: Absolutely.</p>\n<p>Hanne: Well, you even use the word agenting as a negative. The first time you used it, it really surprised me. You were talking about your grandmother, right? Brutally agenting your father.</p>\n<p>Michael: Yeah, well, agenting\u00e2\u0080\u00a6</p>\n<p>Hanne: What do you mean by that?</p>\n<p>Michael: Agenting is, you know, it\u2019s manipulating. It\u2019s pushing. It\u2019s maneuvering. It\u2019s trying to force your will on someone. That\u2019s agenting. And it\u2019s a tough word, and it\u2019s a tough mechanism.</p>\n<p>Hanne: It\u2019s the dark side of that.</p>\n<p>Michael: It\u2019s the Darth Vader side of the business. By the way, it is not just agents that do that. Producers do it. Some people call directors light-handed, or heavy-handed, or that they work by example, or they work in different ways. Well, they agent too. You know, everyone has an act that they use, and agenting is a part of everybody\u2019s life in the entertainment business.</p>\n<p>Hanne: So your career has spanned an incredible evolution of the entertainment business over the last several decades. What\u00e2\u0080\u0099s your sense of what the entertainment and media landscape looks like now, and where it might be going?</p>\n<p>Michael: The entertainment business to me is, parts of it are wildly exciting and parts of it are incredibly disappointing. It\u2019s hard to not be excited about the dissenter mediation of streaming. It\u2019s hard to be excited about the dissenter mediation of streaming, when it\u2019s taking the entire culture of 100 years of history and turning it on its ear.</p>\n<p>We had a business where with these barriers to entry that had some negative connotation and some positive connotation. People paid to go see people do big projects. Today, people go to streaming services and their viewing patterns are antithetical to history. So, for 50 years in this country people sat around a radio or a TV set for set times when things were on.</p>\n<p>Hanne: Right.</p>\n<p>Michael: So, on Thursday nights when \u201cSeinfeld\u201d was on and something culturally happened on \u201cSeinfeld\u201d that was significant, people\u00e2\u0080\u00a6</p>\n<p>Hanne: Right, the water cooler effect.</p>\n<p>Michael: The water cooler effect. Everybody talked about it. There is no day and date except for sports. People talk about things on social media as they see them, but everything\u2019s disjointed.</p>\n<p>Hanne: So, how do you think that will change, if you had to look forward five years, the power equation, you know, that you guys really changed with your model?</p>\n<p>Michael: When I look at my old business, I am happy for the progress that\u2019s being made. I\u2019m sad that the traditions of the business have dissipated to this point. The idea of building a movie star now is not possible.</p>\n<p>Hanne: What do you mean by that?</p>\n<p>Michael: The idea of finding a 19-year-old kid named Tom Cruise and building him brick by brick with his own talent, and putting him with great directors, and letting that mature and grow, it\u2019s hard to do right now because there are so few movies being made.</p>\n<p>Yes, people go to see movies, but a lot of them are event movies, they\u2019re\u00e2\u0080\u00a6</p>\n<p>Ben: Sequels.</p>\n<p>Michael: \u00e2\u0080\u00a6sequels.</p>\n<p>Ben: Remakes.</p>\n<p>Hanne: Yeah.</p>\n<p>Michael: And you don\u2019t get that, \u201cRisky Business,\u201d and then \u201cTop Gun,\u201d and then all of a sudden you throw in \u201cBorn on the Fourth of July,\u201d which is a great actors\u2019 piece. That way of building a career doesn\u2019t exist anymore. It\u2019s very hard to do.</p>\n<p>Ben: you know, it\u2019s interesting, because music is following a similar curve where, yeah, it\u2019s much harder to build a great artist than it used to be, you know, with a series of albums that everybody knows. That\u2019s becoming a more rare thing.</p>\n<p>Hanne: To nurture a whole career.</p>\n<p>Michael: Plus, there\u2019s so much here today, gone tomorrow.</p>\n<p>Ben: Yeah, that\u2019s\u00e2\u0080\u00a6</p>\n<p>Michael: It\u2019s really tough for an artist.</p>\n<p>Ben: \u00e2\u0080\u00a6very fast, yeah. Extremely difficult.</p>\n<p>Hanne: So, what do you think will take its place?</p>\n<p>Michael: I have no idea. I really don\u2019t. We\u2019re in the middle of the trough right now. We\u2019re not at the beginning, we\u2019re not at the end, we\u2019re dead center in the middle.</p>\n<p>Ben: Yeah.</p>\n<p>Michael: We\u2019ve got a big shoe to drop when Disney and Fox complete their merger and they start that streaming service. What\u2019s gonna happen with Hulu is gonna be interesting. Amazon seems very committed, they\u2019re not gonna be left behind. So, you\u2019ve got behemoth businesses that are well financed getting into content, and that\u2019s without Microsoft and Facebook and Google.</p>\n<p>Ben: Yeah, it\u2019s a great time to be a writer.</p>\n<p>Michael: Oh my God, it\u2019s a great time to be a writer. It\u2019s a great time to be a creative person, because we went from a dearth of money to more money than anyone needs, and a new form of distribution. So, do I think it ends up good? Yeah. Do I think it ends up great? Yeah. Do I know how it gets there? I don\u2019t have a clue.</p>\n<p>Hanne: Let\u2019s talk a little bit about negotiation, because that\u2019s obviously such a big thread through both industries, you talk about incredibly complex negotiations from, you know, signing Sean Connery to IMPAY coming to design your buildings, to the MCA deal. You talk about some of the key principles. Kind of in a little offhand way, one of them was always plot out the desired end point. There was another moment in the book where you talked about the importance of reading body language during negotiations. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d love to know what those core principles are for you for how to negotiate.</p>\n<p>Michael: I didn\u2019t wanna put in a bunch of principles in a row, like make a list, like, \u201cHere\u2019s how you negotiate.\u201d And the reason is I believe that every single deal that one approaches is like an art form. It\u2019s not a science. Everything has to be plotted out in its own vernacular.</p>\n<p>So selling Universal to Matsushita Electric, or selling Columbia Pictures to Sony, or CBS Records to Sony, or MGM, you know, is bad debt, or signing Sean Connery who\u2019s come off three bad pictures, or negotiating a new kind of deal for \u201cJurassic Park\u201d where no money changes hands and it\u2019s all about ownership. Every single situation is different, and necessitates its own architecture.</p>\n<p>Hanne: It\u2019s its own universe.</p>\n<p>Michael: Everything is different. Saying that you have to know where you wanna end up when you go in is the same for everything, but that\u2019s not the art of putting the deal together.</p>\n<p>Hanne: They\u00e2\u0080\u0099re two separate things.</p>\n<p>Michael: They\u2019re separate things. Of course, one wants to know where they wanna come out. I always liked to have my end result in my mind as I was working toward it, because to me, I\u2019m actually building a house when I negotiate. And I start with a foundation. That foundation is usually the idea or the material that I\u2019m negotiating on, whatever it is. Whether it\u2019s a company, a screenplay, a movie, a television show, a book, or a record, it didn\u2019t matter what it was. There\u2019s a foundation. And then we try to build a framework around it. And then putting the roof on is getting the right deal.</p>\n<p>Negotiating is not a rote act, which is something that I learned early on from a man named Howard West, who was one of my bosses at an early age. I was 22 years old, and I watched him negotiate writers\u2019 deals and I used to ask him, \u201cHow did you decide what a writer\u2019s material is worth? $100, or $1,000, or $10,000? There\u2019s no rate card for it.\u201d And he explained to me this concept of how it\u2019s a fluid and loose moving idea around it. That struck me.</p>\n<p>Hanne: Well, we\u2019re all agreeing on value all the time, right? Value is always like ephemeral shifting thing that we just agree on.</p>\n<p>Michael: Except when you sit in a room and the other side vehemently disagrees with you, and then you\u2019ve got to bridge the gap.</p>\n<p>Ben: It\u2019s such an important point, in that we can improve in the way we think about deals and how we train people in these kinds of things, but it\u2019s dynamic, you know, you walk in, you\u2019re dealing with a very, very complex person or entity on the other side. They have a history. They have needs. They have things they want. They have things they don\u2019t care about. They have motivations.</p>\n<p>Michael: And they wanna win.</p>\n<p>Ben: And they wanna win. They wanna win in the deal. And you have to understand all those things and then plan a strategy but as soon as you get into a formula, or a set of principles, or something you can just run, then you\u2019re not listening. And that\u2019s death in a deal. And a lot of it is emotional like, you know, do you have the right mentality?</p>\n<p>One of my favorite memories of being CEO, it\u2019s the worst memory and the best memory, we were working on the deal with EDS and we had EDS and IBM both in the hunt. And, you know, we really needed the deal to finish at a certain time, but there was no reason to have it finished at that time. So, I asked Michael, can we say the deal is gonna end here even if it may not end here? And how do we think about that?\u201d</p>\n<p>That question just made him stop and he said, \u201cLook, I believe in artificial deadlines. I believe in playing one against the other, and I believe that you have to do anything and everything possible short of immoral or illegal, to get the damn deal done.\u201d And I was like, \u201cOkay, I\u2019ve just been thinking about this one.\u201d</p>\n<p>You have to believe you can figure it out. You have to convince yourself, and then convince the other side. I was thinking I was on my heels, and like you have to be on your toes to win in a deal, but there was no\u00e2\u0080\u00a6and I couldn\u2019t ask him for like, \u201cWhat\u2019s the recipe?\u201d</p>\n<p>You know, click this, and you\u2019ll have a $64 million plus a $20 million a year contract. Like, that\u2019s not how you get that.</p>\n<p>Hanne: No recipe but kind of a constitution, or like the walls of a house. I\u2019m hearing still like kind of core concepts of how you approach it, like visualize what you want at the end. Be aggressive. Everything has its own language, kind of its own principles.</p>\n<p>Michael: But all the houses are different.</p>\n<p>Ben: All the houses are different. That was that house.</p>\n<p>Michael: Yeah.</p>\n<p>Ben: He gave me the rules for that house.</p>\n<p>Hanne: Yeah.</p>\n<p>Michael: That rule may and would not have applied to about 99% of the other deals.</p>\n<p>Hanne: You joke in your book from going from Valley to Valley. What are some of the differences between the two cultures? And some of the advice you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve learned in Hollywood that you now find yourself sharing with tech entrepreneurs?</p>\n<p>Michael: I will say the one common denominator is everyone is particularly interested in mistakes, because they don\u2019t wanna make them. And we don\u2019t see that down in LA. No one wants to know anything about mistakes. They wanna forget them and sweep\u00e2\u0080\u00a6</p>\n<p>Hanne: Oh, how interesting.</p>\n<p>Michael: \u00e2\u0080\u00a6them under the rug. You don\u2019t see that in New York, either.</p>\n<p>Ben: Yeah, that\u2019s funny.</p>\n<p>Michael: The founders up here say, \u201cSo, when you did this, what would have happened if you did that? And why did you do it that way? In retrospect, it doesn\u2019t look like you did it the right way.\u201d And they\u2019re right, and they\u2019re really, really, they want to know.</p>\n<p>And look, they\u2019re also interested in some of the things that were successful. They\u2019re interested in the culture, Marc always talks about software eating the world. Our culture ate the entertainment business. It just did. And so did the Andreessen Horowitz culture.</p>\n<p>So, it\u2019s interesting when something works a second time.

There was a whole sort of first generation of SaaS tools that really would hallmark their benefits of it\u2019s easy to use, it\u2019s really simple.</p>\n<p>I always think back to Microsoft Excel versus Google Sheets, Excel is easy to use, but it allows you to be a power user if you want to be.</p>\n<p><strong>Rahul:</strong> I would argue that, actually, companies like Salesforce and Atlassian with Jira were catering to power users. It\u2019s just that the complexity and the configurability were so strong that the companies almost lost sight of the fact that it should be enjoyable to use.</p>\n<p>I think what\u2019s changed recently is the ability to then also package it in a consumer-ish fashion.</p>\n<p>The challenge with tools like Salesforce and JIRA as well as really any other piece of enterprise software, or more generally, any piece of power user software, is that they often end up looking inelegant and becoming visually cluttered.</p>\n<span class=\"bctt-click-to-tweet\"><span class=\"bctt-ctt-text\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https://a16z.com/2020/06/23/a16z-podcast-building-products-for-power-users/&amp;text=Many%20prosumers%20don%27t%20necessarily%20have%20the%20time%20to%20become%20power%20users%2C%20but%20if%20you%20can%20get%20them%20there%2C%20they%20then%20represent%20a%20very%20powerful%20market.%20-Rahul%20Vohra&amp;via=a16z&amp;related=a16z\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Many prosumers don't necessarily have the time to become power users, but if you can get them there, they then represent a very powerful market. -Rahul Vohra </a></span><a class=\"bctt-ctt-btn\" href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https://a16z.com/2020/06/23/a16z-podcast-building-products-for-power-users/&amp;text=Many%20prosumers%20don%27t%20necessarily%20have%20the%20time%20to%20become%20power%20users%2C%20but%20if%20you%20can%20get%20them%20there%2C%20they%20then%20represent%20a%20very%20powerful%20market.%20-Rahul%20Vohra&amp;via=a16z&amp;related=a16z\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Click To Tweet</a></span>\n<p><strong>David:</strong> You\u2019re totally right that Salesforce and JIRA are very configurable. But in fact, most companies that deploy Salesforce end up hiring a third party, or hiring a specialized person inside the company just to administer it just because it\u2019s so configurable. And I don\u2019t think anybody that ever uses Salesforce would call it a joy to use.</p>\n<p>That lends itself to a conversation around design. And for those that don\u2019t know, Superhuman is often driven through two mechanisms. One is called a command palette, which is sort of like a command line that pops up wherever you are, and then through lots of keyboard shortcuts.</p>\n<p>And so, what gave you the confidence to build a prosumer application that really encouraged or forced people through their onboarding, to become power users? How did you know that was gonna work, and how do you think about usability in light of that?</p>\n<p><strong>Rahul:</strong> Those who know me well know that I started a PhD in computer science. I spent a lot of time thinking about human computer interaction and this idea of ease of use. And I came to the conclusion that as a whole industry, we had played way too hard into learnability and into ease of use, and that we were really doing our customers a disservice. We are assuming they\u2019re not as intelligent as they actually are.</p>\n<p>So, we aggressively push in the other direction. What we worry about is can it do all the things that you want it to do? When you\u2019re a power user are you really, really fast? And we\u2019ll solve the problem of you becoming a power user through other techniques.</p>\n<p>I had this belief, having grown up as a developer that keyboard shortcuts were the way to go. But I knew that people generally don\u2019t use them. Less than two percent of the entire Gmail user base have even used a keyboard shortcut once.</p>\n<p>So, how do we solve the problem of teaching users? Funnily enough, I realized the answer had been staring me in the face for my entire career as a programmer. It\u2019s this idea of a command palette. Every text editor for programmers from VI through Emacs through Vim to things like TextMate and Sublime more recently, and every big IDE has a command palette.</p>\n<p>We\u2019re able to add arbitrary amounts of functionality without ever making it more cluttered, because we found an entirely new way to interact and to operate the software.</p>\n<p>You simply hit one master keyboard shortcut, in Superhuman that happens to be command K, and then you just type in the thing you\u2019re looking for. At that point, you can hit \u201cEnter,\u201d and it will do it. But not only that, it will also teach you the keyboard shortcut for next time. So, you start up this mastery curve.</p>\n<p><strong>David:</strong> I had an interesting reminder of exactly what you\u2019re talking about during this quarantine. I decided that since I was stuck at home, I was gonna go buy an Xbox. And when I have been a gamer in other parts of my life, it\u2019s always been on a PC, where I\u2019ve used a keyboard and a mouse. For the first time, I had this controller, and all I could think about was, \u201cMan, this is terrible compared to gaming on a PC, where you have so many buttons at your fingertips and you can drive shortcuts and remap your keys the way you want.\u201d</p>\n<p>And I actually found that the Xbox controller was nowhere near as fun as playing a game using a keyboard and a mouse.</p>\n<p><strong>Rahul:</strong> So, in game design, we have this notion of a lean-back or a lean-forward experience. And TV is a lean-back experience. Now, with console gaming, it really does depend on the game. You\u2019re probably not going to play \u201cCall of Duty\u201d leaning back. But you might play \u201cAnimal Crossing\u201d that way.</p>\n<p>And so as a product designer, I think there\u2019s just a set of questions you have to answer.</p>\n<p>Are you building a lean-back versus a lean-forward experience? How do you want people to feel? What is the primary thing you\u2019re optimizing for? Is it the feeling of power? Well, then, you\u2019re going to want to let customers remap their keys and run things their own way.</p>\n<p><strong>David:</strong> You take a very consumer-like view to how you present, essentially, an enterprise software product, So, how do you think about the lines between consumer and enterprise software? And does that relate to that learning curve of letting something be powerful but also be a joy to use?</p>\n<span class=\"bctt-click-to-tweet\"><span class=\"bctt-ctt-text\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https://a16z.com/2020/06/23/a16z-podcast-building-products-for-power-users/&amp;text=No%20feature%20or%20product%20has%20ever%20really%20had%20a%20viral%20loop%20of%20greater%20than%20one%20for%20any%20meaningful%20period%20of%20time.%20-Rahul%20Vohra&amp;via=a16z&amp;related=a16z\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">No feature or product has ever really had a viral loop of greater than one for any meaningful period of time. -Rahul Vohra </a></span><a class=\"bctt-ctt-btn\" href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https://a16z.com/2020/06/23/a16z-podcast-building-products-for-power-users/&amp;text=No%20feature%20or%20product%20has%20ever%20really%20had%20a%20viral%20loop%20of%20greater%20than%20one%20for%20any%20meaningful%20period%20of%20time.%20-Rahul%20Vohra&amp;via=a16z&amp;related=a16z\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Click To Tweet</a></span>\n<p><strong>Rahul:</strong> In practice, we\u2019ve ended up with a very interesting hybrid of both enterprise and consumer. Around 60% of our subscriptions are enterprise. They are expensed or paid for directly by companies. But the other 40% is what you might call consumer. They are paid for directly by end-users, albeit for their work email.</p>\n<p>All of our customers come to us as prosumers, but not all of them come to us as power users. Historically, many power users simply have not been able to pay. That\u2019s why they became power users in the first place, because often they were writing their own software. And many prosumers don\u2019t necessarily have the time to become power users, but if you can get them there, they then represent a very powerful market.</p>\n<p>And we see a big part of our responsibility, when they buy our software, to help them become the power user that they aspire to be. So, we put a lot of effort into helping folks level up. And believe it or not, we get many customers who come to us who have never used a keyboard shortcut in their life.</p>\n<p>And this is one of the main reasons why we onboard users. For each new user, we do a 30-minute one-to-one video call. We teach faster workflows, powerful shortcuts, And using innovations like the command palette, we teach you how to teach yourself so you can quickly become a power user.</p>\n<p><strong>David:</strong> Do you think that the way that you\u2019re doing your onboarding would be another reason why you couldn\u2019t have gone down the mass adoption consumer route?</p>\n<p><strong>Rahul:</strong> The constraints around whether or not you can onboard fundamentally come down to unit economics. You can do it so long as your churn and retention are good enough.</p>\n<p>There is an argument to be made that if something has more of a consumer price point, it becomes economically untenable. But in practice, it really does depend on your churn. Let\u2019s say you had a $10 per month price point. If you could show me that your churn was zero or perhaps even negative, then by all means, I would say yes, you should onboard.</p>\n<p>Zooming out all the way, the question is, are you making net promoters or are you making net detractors? And I don\u2019t like to leave this to chance. Personally, I would rather invest every dollar we have in helping every single customer become a net promoter, because that is the flywheel behind any company that has reached massive scale.</p>\n<p>And this was a lesson that I learned relatively early in my career. So, when I sold Rapportive to LinkedIn, I had the very fortunate privilege of working for Elliott Shmukler, who was our Head of Growth, and took the company from 25 million members to 250 million members.</p>\n<p>In our first one-to-one I sat down and I said, \u201cHey, Elliot, please teach me everything that you know about virality.\u201d And he said, \u201cWell, lesson number one is that there isn\u2019t such a thing as true virality. No feature or product has ever really had a viral loop of greater than one for any meaningful period of time. Even at LinkedIn the address book import has had a viral factor of 0.4. And even at Facebook, the most viral company of all time, they were not able to sustain 0.7 for more than about seven months.\u201d</p>\n<p>At the end of the day, it always comes down to word-of-mouth organic spread, it comes down to brand, it comes down to building a product that people love.</p>\n<span class=\"bctt-click-to-tweet\"><span class=\"bctt-ctt-text\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https://a16z.com/2020/06/23/a16z-podcast-building-products-for-power-users/&amp;text=At%20the%20end%20of%20the%20day%2C%20it%20always%20comes%20down%20to%20word-of-mouth%20organic%20spread%2C%20it%20comes%20down%20to%20brand%2C%20it%20comes%20down%20to%20building%20a%20product%20that%20people%20love.%20-Rahul%20Vohra&amp;via=a16z&amp;related=a16z\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">At the end of the day, it always comes down to word-of-mouth organic spread, it comes down to brand, it comes down to building a product that people love. -Rahul Vohra </a></span><a class=\"bctt-ctt-btn\" href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https://a16z.com/2020/06/23/a16z-podcast-building-products-for-power-users/&amp;text=At%20the%20end%20of%20the%20day%2C%20it%20always%20comes%20down%20to%20word-of-mouth%20organic%20spread%2C%20it%20comes%20down%20to%20brand%2C%20it%20comes%20down%20to%20building%20a%20product%20that%20people%20love.%20-Rahul%20Vohra&amp;via=a16z&amp;related=a16z\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Click To Tweet</a></span>\n<p><strong>David:</strong> I wrote a blog post last year about this idea of product-user fit, and you\u2019ve talked about how do you satisfy that high expectation customer. One of the things I\u2019ve noticed over the last 18 months or so, as I spent some time with, seed-stage companies that are building a product that they want to be widely available, is that, when they look at their numbers, the averages are terrible. So, if they look at retention, it looks terrible. If they look at, number of minutes per day in the application, it\u2019s terrible.</p>\n<p>But then if they focus on the users who are using the application every single day, those users are using it constantly, they\u2019re spending hours a day in it. And so they\u2019ve started to try to figure out how do you focus on what\u2019s making those users really happy.</p>\n<p><strong>Rahul:</strong> I see this all the time in founders. They\u2019ll come to me lamenting, \u201cHey, my month-to-month churn rate is north of seven percent. Surely, we are screwed.\u201d And I\u2019m like, \u201cWait, hold up, hold up. Let\u2019s segment these users out. First of all, let\u2019s discard all users who didn\u2019t activate, because we need to separate activation problems from ongoing value proposition problems. And then next let\u2019s segment out users who have different personas, different job titles, those who are paying personally versus those who are expensing it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Because if you\u2019ve built something even half interesting, there will be a set of users who find it compelling. And the whole purpose of the product-market fit engine is to identify that segment, and then to systematically expand it over time.</p>\n<p><strong>David:</strong> When users love a product, you\u2019re constantly getting suggestions and requests for features or changes for what would make it better, how do you balance those priorities for new users while you\u2019re still trying to serve that core base of power users?</p>\n<p><strong>Rahul:</strong> In my experience, startups tend towards one of two extremes. Some teams, especially those which are driven by vision, tend to constantly double down on what users love, whereas some teams, especially those which are driven by data, tend to systematically address user issues.</p>\n<p>In practice, you need to keep vision and data in very careful balance. Now, doubling down on vision is truly an art. This is where we get to exercise the so-called product instinct. And this is all about talking to your users, and figuring out the most impactful ways to give people more of the feelings that they crave.</p>\n<p>Now, addressing user issues is much more straightforward, and for that, we use a very simple cost-impact analysis. We then pick the projects, which are both low-cost as well as high-impact.</p>\n<p><strong>David:</strong> But then there must be things that are hard and take a long time. How do you deal with things that are high-cost, high-impact?</p>\n<p><strong>Rahul:</strong> So the answer is yes. I have a metaphor that I wrote down the other day that I\u2019m looking for.</p>\n<p><strong>David:</strong> Did you use a command palette to find it?</p>\n<p><strong>Rahul:</strong> I used Command E to open the document, so actually, yes. So, what do we do about the big things that are high-impact?</p>\n<span class=\"bctt-click-to-tweet\"><span class=\"bctt-ctt-text\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https://a16z.com/2020/06/23/a16z-podcast-building-products-for-power-users/&amp;text=If%20you%27ve%20built%20something%20even%20half%20interesting%2C%20there%20will%20be%20a%20set%20of%20users%20who%20find%20it%20compelling.%20-Rahul%20Vohra&amp;via=a16z&amp;related=a16z\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">If you've built something even half interesting, there will be a set of users who find it compelling. -Rahul Vohra </a></span><a class=\"bctt-ctt-btn\" href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https://a16z.com/2020/06/23/a16z-podcast-building-products-for-power-users/&amp;text=If%20you%27ve%20built%20something%20even%20half%20interesting%2C%20there%20will%20be%20a%20set%20of%20users%20who%20find%20it%20compelling.%20-Rahul%20Vohra&amp;via=a16z&amp;related=a16z\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Click To Tweet</a></span>\n<p>We get asked this question a lot by customers who write in, and they say, \u201cHey, why haven\u2019t you built my pet feature?\u201d that incidentally, would take us a year or two to build. And so I think of our team capacity as a glass jar. Launch projects are big rocks, medium and small projects are pebbles of various sizes.</p>\n<p>The most efficient way to fill the jar is a combination of big rocks and small pebbles. First, add in the big rocks, and then the pebbles can fit in and around them to fill the jar. If you were to add the pebbles first, fewer big rocks would fit in. But if you added big rocks only, there would be unused space.</p>\n<p>So, it\u2019s sort of classic Silicon Valley tradition that when a new engineer joins a team, they should ship on the first day or two. That\u2019s a really good opportunity to work on a small pebble, to fix a bug, to get something out into production.</p>\n<p>Every quarter, we also identify one massive rock and a few medium sized stones and a large number of small pebbles. We know roughly what order we\u2019re going to do them, but what the small pebbles give us is the opportunity to be flexible with the plan in the face of unknown unknowns.</p>\n<p>Let\u2019s say we run into an API issue, or there\u2019s a scaling problem, that throws a wrench in our otherwise beautifully designed plan. Well, then we can move the small pebbles around and still ship with high cadence, despite the changes.</p>\n<p><strong>David:</strong> So, how do you know when your product is mature and you can sustain the sort of innovation on the core product, while expanding into a new product or a new surface area? When do you make that decision, and how do you think about those things?</p>\n<p><strong>Rahul:</strong> It\u2019s not: \u00e2\u0080\u009cis the product mature?\u00e2\u0080\u009d It\u2019s: \u00e2\u0080\u009cis the company ready?\u00e2\u0080\u009d</p>\n<p>I think it\u2019s a fairly common mistake for founders to see that a product is working well, and then they move on to starting the next one. But they often forget just how hard it was to get to product-market fit in the first place. Now, imagine searching for product-market fit again, whilst maintaining product-market fit on the first product, presumably in the face of competition, and on top of that, balancing resources and attention between the two.</p>\n<p>For us, it was absolutely the right strategy at the start to sell to prosumers, the right thin edge of a wedge, to paraphrase C. Dixon.</p>\n<p>As for whether you lower the bar to appeal to customers, the question I would ask is this: do you have to? Because it comes with significant cost, attention, time, money, brand.</p>\n<p>Another way of asking the same question is: can you be a billion dollar company without lowering the bar? Let\u2019s assume that at the point, we\u2019re a billion-dollar company, our valuation is 10 times our run rate, and so our ARR is $100 million. That would then imply we have 300,000 subscribers at $30 a month.</p>\n<p>So we ask ourselves, do we think we can reach hundreds of thousands of prosumers? And our answer is, absolutely, yes, we can.</p>\n<p>So, if something is working, I now believe that it is almost always better to double down and do more of that thing than to spin up something new. When every single team is fully staffed; when you have an excess of resources and personnel; when, to quote Marc Andreessen, with his famous description of product-market fit, \u201cYour checking account is overflowing with money because you\u2019re just making so much cash.\u201d That\u2019s the right time to take on the focus risk and to start an adjacent product.</p>\n<p><strong>David:</strong> When I think through the iconic products of our time, almost all of those companies then tried to create adjacent products. And in fact, the two things exactly that you don\u2019t want to have happen, happened.</p>\n<p>First, the second products generally did not take off the way they had hoped. And oftentimes, the first product sort of stagnated. There\u2019s products that all of us have used where now, maybe five-plus years later, they\u2019re finally going back to the core product and just incrementally making it better. What they\u2019re doing is expanding the surface area of that core product, as opposed to building these adjacent products that are not based on the same core use cases and audience of that initial product.</p>\n<p><strong>Rahul:</strong> I think when you can do this also depends on the structure of the business. Do you have a moat? Are there network effects?</p>\n<p>Now, for most SaaS companies there are network effects, but they\u2019re relatively weak by comparison to a Facebook or more classically, an eBay or a Skype. And so inherently, SaaS companies just have to spend more time on building features and staying competitive. Arguably, if you\u2019re building, let\u2019s say, a classic social network or a company with that kind of network effect, once you\u2019re up and operating and at scale, you do have a little bit more latitude to go and try something else, because there\u2019s inherently more defense built into the products and the ecosystem that you have created.</p>\n<p>And for founders who are interested in sort of thinking about this a little bit more Hiten Shah wrote a really good article when the acquisition of Trello was announced. He posed the question, \u201cWell, why did they sell even at half a billion? Why didn\u2019t they keep on growing?\u201d</p>\n<p>And he posited that it was because the thing that they had popularized, the drag and drop kanban board, had simply become a feature of things like GitHub, and Asana, and Jira, and so it was no longer competitive. What they failed to do was to constantly build and focus on their core products.</p>\n<p><strong>David:</strong> Now that you\u2019ve said you\u2019re committed to doubling down on the core product and adding features that make it better, that opens up the discussion of what about packaging? What about pricing? Is pricing something that should be optimized? If you\u2019re just reinvesting in your core product and adding features, does everybody get those features?</p>\n<p><strong>Rahul:</strong> It is impossible to truly separate pricing from packaging from positioning. Now, I\u2019d go to a cocktail party, back when we used to have those, and I\u2019d listen to people talking. By the way, this is a great way to learn how to market your product. They would invariably say two things. Number one, Superhuman is super crazy fast, and number two, Superhuman is $30 a month.</p>\n<p>The second thing that they would say was the price of the product. In our case, the price is literally part of both package and positioning. And when founders ask me, \u201cHow do I figure out what my pricing should be?\u201d My answer is always, \u201cYou should first figure out your positioning.\u201d</p>\n<p>So, we started with this article by Arielle Jackson who, for folks who don\u2019t know her, she actually happened to be the first product marketing manager on Gmail.</p>\n<p>She wrote this article called \u201cPositioning Your Startup is Vital \u2013 Here\u2019s How to Nail It.\u201d She advises using a formula \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and it\u2019s a little bit of a Mad Libs game for a target customer who has a need or an opportunity. [Your product] is in a [product category] that provides [some key benefits], and unlike [competitors], [your product] has these [differentiators].</p>\n<p>Folks will notice that was a very tight definition. You can then use that to figure out your pricing.</p>\n<p>In the book \u201cMonetizing Innovation,\u201d the author, Madhavan, advocates for developing pricing alongside product in a way that supports the positioning that you\u2019ve just come up with. Now, he covers a lot of ways to do this, and we used one of the easiest methods, which is the Van Westendorp price sensitivity meter.</p>\n<p>In late 2015, we asked 100 of our earliest users these questions. Number one, at what price would you consider Superhuman to be so expensive that you just wouldn\u2019t buy it? Number two, what price would you consider Superhuman to be priced so low that you would feel the quality wouldn\u2019t be very good, and that would be concerning? Number three, at what price would you consider Superhuman to be starting to get expensive so that it is not out of the question, but you would have to give some thought to buying it and you still would? And number four, at what price would you consider Superhuman to be a bargain, a great buy for the money?</p>\n<p>Now, most Silicon Valley companies orient around question number four, the bargain question. And that\u2019s because most tend to be selling into a new market or a new buyer in an existing market. But for us, it made sense to adopt that premium position. And the price points that most directly supports the premium position comes out of the third question, when does it feel expensive, but you\u2019d still buy it anyway? For us, the median answer to that third question was $30 a month, and that\u2019s how we picked our price.</p>\n<p>Once you\u2019ve picked the price, it\u2019s always a good idea to do a quick gut check on market size, can you grow into a billion dollar valuation?</p>\n<p><strong>David:</strong> So, this has been an awesome discussion. We started at this really exciting place of really understanding the difference between power users and prosumers, and how do we turn prosumers into power users. And then how to make sure users are engaged and are net promoters, and ultimately, how you think about pricing and packaging.</p>\n<p>So thank you, Rahul, it\u2019s excellent that you spend your time talking about these things for other founders out there.</p>\n<p><strong>Rahul:</strong> Well, thank you so much for having me.</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p><em>The views expressed here are those of the individual AH Capital Management, L.L.C.

We have published the full transcript below.</em></p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p><strong>Das:</strong> Throughout the history of open source, talking about making money on open source has been a pretty controversial topic with a lot of different views. So, I\u2019m curious, Ali and Armon, how have you thought about commercializing open source, and why did you choose to turn a project into a business?</p>\n<p><strong>Armon:</strong> For us, it didn\u2019t start necessarily as thinking about turning the open source into the business. It was more around recognizing that there\u2019s a clear market gap in terms of, in our case, DevOps tooling, and how do we actually provision things in cloud infrastructure. And then realizing it\u2019s very hard to become a large sustainable project if you have negative cash flow forever.</p>\n<p>If you\u2019re at a university and you have grants and things that can fund it, or it\u2019s a little hobby project and it\u2019s two or three people doing it on a weekend. fine. But if you\u2019re solving a large enough problem, you eventually need teams of dozens, hundreds, thousands to work on that problem. You need a business. There has to be a topline connected to your bottom line. Otherwise, it doesn\u2019t make a lot of sense.</p>\n<p>And so, for us, it started pretty pragmatically in terms of, \u201cHey, we are passionate about the technology, passionate about the space. We want this to be viable long-term.\u201d Well, the only way for it to be viable long-term is if you make money.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<h3><em><strong>If you\u2019re solving a large enough problem, you eventually need teams of dozens, hundreds, thousands to work on that problem. You need a business. There has to be a topline connected to your bottom line. </strong></em><strong>\u00e2\u0080\u0093</strong><strong>Armon Dadgar, HashiCorp</strong></h3>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Ali:</strong> I\u2019m just gonna be honest. We were academics. We just wanted to have impact, and we wanted to publish papers. And the software we built, people didn\u2019t want to adopt it. We went to all the companies that were out there \u00e2\u0080\u0093 went to Cloudera, all these guys. We said, \u201cPlease take the software. Take it with you. Take credit for it.\u201d And they all just refused. They said, \u201cThis is just academic mumbo jumbo. Not interesting. What if these PhD students just leave?\u201d This is enterprise software we\u2019re selling, so they rejected us.</p>\n<p>So, in 2013, we were kind of frustrated. We said, \u201cIf we wanna actually succeed, the only way we can get these projects off the ground is if we actually start something ourselves.\u201d They wasted so much of our time.</p>\n<p><strong>Peter:</strong> What do you really think?</p>\n<p><strong>Ali:</strong> We were sending interns into these companies, hoping that they would adopt our software. It never happened. We were frustrated. In 2013, we just said, \u201cLet\u2019s create a company ourselves and do it.\u201d I don\u2019t think revenue was top of mind for us.</p>\n<p>The first two years at Databricks, our only goal was how can we make Spark and the software that we have take over the world?</p>\n<p><strong>Das:</strong> Let\u2019s talk about the flip side. You choose to go out and have a commercial venture. How have you gone about managing your community and communicating that with them and keeping their support for what you\u2019re doing?</p>\n<p><strong>Armon:</strong> For us, it goes back to Peter\u2019s point around having a clear product management framework that you can articulate where your community doesn\u2019t feel like you\u2019re just randomly picking what goes one way or the other. For us, it was really trying to draw that line and saying: the things that are truly organizational complexity problems \u00e2\u0080\u0093 you have role-based access control; you want audit logging; you need PCI, ISO, SOC compliance \u00e2\u0080\u0093 if you have those problems, you\u2019re probably a global 10,000 business. You\u2019re not an SMB hobbyist.</p>\n<p>We drew that line and articulated to the community and said, \u201cHey. things in this bucket, great, they go into enterprise.\u201d And the people who were gonna pay for that are the people who have that problem. You as a hobbyist don\u2019t care about hardware security device integration for your compliance. It\u2019s not a problem you have.</p>\n<p>I think if you articulate it clearly that way, and have the discipline to stick to it, then the community doesn\u2019t feel like they\u2019re sort of randomly being jerked around. And they don\u2019t feel like they\u2019re losing value because those aren\u2019t problems they have.</p>\n<p><strong>Ali:</strong> For us, we\u2019re different \u00e2\u0080\u0093 you guys are much smarter than us. We didn\u2019t think these things through. We just wanted Spark to take over the world as an open source project, so we only had one roadmap. It was the open source roadmap. And we were frustrated that no one would adopt it.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<h3><em><strong>The first three years, our only goal was get adoption. We didn\u2019t care about any revenue \u00e2\u0080\u0093 three or four years in, we only had one million revenue. We only had one roadmap. We only managed the community. </strong></em><strong>\u00e2\u0080\u0093</strong><strong>Ali Ghodsi, Databricks</strong></h3>\n</blockquote>\n<p>There was a lot of FUD (fear, uncertainty, doubt) in the market that the technology we built won\u2019t work for this and won\u2019t work for that. It only works if it\u2019s in memory, not if it\u2019s on disk. We were super frustrated, and the first three years, our only goal was get adoption. We didn\u2019t care about any revenue \u00e2\u0080\u0093 three or four years in, we only had one million revenue. We only had one roadmap. We only managed the community.</p>\n<p>Then in 2015, it just exploded. You saw some of the curves. Thousands of developers started contributing code to it. And at that point, that\u2019s when things started turning. The community was so big, and this thing became way bigger than we were. We were unknown, and then the project was huge. So, at that point, we started thinking, \u201cHey. How do we actually monetize this thing?\u201d</p>\n<p><strong>Das:</strong> Can you talk a little bit more about that moment in 2015 where you have this huge community and now you\u2019re starting to think about the secondary roadmap where you\u2019re commercializing something? How did the conversations change?</p>\n<p><strong>Ali:</strong> Well, remember those guys that said, \u201cHey, we don\u2019t want your stuff, it\u2019s crap\u201d? In 2015, they all took it. And then they went and said, \u201cWe are the Spark company,\u201d and they took credit for it. At that point, we were like, \u201cWow, okay.\u201d Everyone was adopting Spark, and these established vendors were actually taking credit for the product and we were an unknown small company with one million revenue.</p>\n<p>It was at that point that we had to start figure out, \u201cOkay, how do we do this?\u201d And that\u2019s when we actually started leveraging product management and really listening to what do the customers really need. Enterprise customers, what do they need to succeed?</p>\n<p>We realized, actually, that the open source project itself just covers a small portion of it. So, we started building all the other things that they need to have a managed solution for enterprises. We started building that, and we kept a lot of that proprietary, frankly speaking. Starting in 2016, we kind of swung the pendulum the other way.</p>\n<p><strong>Das:</strong> You mentioned a little bit some of these other companies starting. And I think that\u2019s an interesting space that happens with these open source communities as you\u2019re not just the only company contributing back to this code base. How have you navigated some of those relationships where you have competitors in there as well?</p>\n<p><strong>Armon:</strong> You have this natural advantage if you\u2019re the spiritual center of the project. Yes, you could take one of our projects and fork it, and go contribute to yourself. But in any conversation, they\u2019re like, \u201cWhy would I use your version instead of the HashiCorp version?\u201d They\u2019re the author. They\u2019re the creator. They\u2019re the one with the roadmap control.</p>\n<p>So, I think, you see some of it, but it just falls by the wayside so rapidly because it\u2019s so hard for someone else to build a community when there\u2019s already an orbit and universe around the spiritual center of the project. So, I think it\u2019s just super tough. You just don\u2019t see a lot of that.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<h3><em><strong>It\u2019s so hard for someone else to build a community when there\u2019s already an orbit and universe around the spiritual center of the project. </strong></em><strong>\u00e2\u0080\u0093</strong><strong>Armon Dadgar</strong></h3>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Das:</strong> When you say that spiritual center of the project. What gives you that? Where does that come from?</p>\n<p><strong>Armon:</strong> I think a lot of it comes from the credibility of having the founders still there. It\u2019s super hard if you don\u2019t have, if not the founding team, at least the core contributing team. If you have that core development team, the core founders still there, it\u2019s very much the spiritual center.</p>\n<p>And it matters a lot in sales conversations, when you can say, \u201cHey, we have the creator. We have the top 20 contributors.\u00e2\u0080\u009d And I think that\u2019s what gives us that spiritual center.</p>\n<p><strong>Das:</strong> Ali, you mentioned that you had all these other competitors starting around that same time. How did that play out for you with the community and making people realize you guys were the ones to go to for that?</p>\n<p><strong>Ali:</strong> I have a controversial opinion, and it\u2019s that most open source projects are actually just led by one company. There\u2019s really one company that\u2019s contributing to it.</p>\n<p>In fact, most open source projects are super brittle. If you actually look really closely, you\u2019ll notice it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s five people only. It\u2019s six guys or gals that are building the project. And that\u2019s just one company.</p>\n<p>There are some counter examples. In the case of Hadoop, there were two companies, and that created a huge mess. They were fighting each other. One would contribute code to it, the other one would delete it, and then the other one would add it back. Kubernetes maybe has two companies, Google, and it used to be Red Hat. So, it\u2019s usually just one company or two companies.</p>\n<p>In our case, while other people started saying, \u201cHey, we also, offer Spark,\u201d on the ground, they weren\u2019t really actually digging in. They were just selling it.</p>\n<p><strong>Armon:</strong> They\u2019re just packaging it up.</p>\n<p><strong>Ali:</strong> They\u2019re just packaging it up. In the case of HashiCorp, you guys are the only real major contributors. If you look at GitHub, if you sort on contributions and commits, you\u2019ll find that the absolute majority is just probably HashiCorp.</p>\n<p><strong>Peter:</strong> We saw the exact same thing at XenSource. There\u2019s a lot of people who look at the code and maybe put a comment in or whatever. But fundamentally, looking at really innovating and all that really happening, it\u2019s down to really a handful of folks who do it. It\u2019s actually very interesting not withstanding how large the company is getting and all that, there\u2019s always the core group that knows it. Absolutely.</p>\n<p><strong>Armon:</strong> The way we sort of articulate it is almost all of our products make a distinction between what we\u2019ll call core and then the extension points around the edge. If I look at the contributor graph, if you look at the core, it\u2019s exactly that, it\u2019s 5, 10, 20 people working at HashiCorp on 99% of the core.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s the contributions set at the edge where you have these integration points \u00e2\u0080\u0093 take a Terraform, for example, its integration surface is infinite \u00e2\u0080\u0093 And so, at that edge is where you go from 20 contributors to 2,000 contributors on the outside. I would guess for you guys it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a similar thing around there\u2019s the core versus maybe some of the algorithms or plugins that sit at the edge where it\u2019s easier to contribute. You don\u2019t have to be a core expert.</p>\n<p><strong>Ali:</strong> Yeah, I agree. I\u2019m just saying, in terms of a core ownership of the project, it\u2019s one company.</p>\n<p><strong>Peter:</strong> And I would say that where open source sort of degrades is the opposite of that where you have many companies all arguing with each other. OpenStack was really, to me, a great example of that where it was a jump ball. Every company had their own version, had their own thing, and there was no consistency with it because there was, in my mind, no leadership of that project.</p>\n<p><strong>Das:</strong> While we\u2019re kind of on the topic of participating in these communities, how have you gone about managing the engineering function within an organization, and keeping them involved? And how do they interact with that community?</p>\n<p><strong>Ali:</strong> The way I see it these days is you run a company, you have an engineering department, you have your product management, and you\u2019re building an awesome product that\u2019s gonna wow your customers. That\u2019s it. A portion of it happens to be open source for us these days. And that portion, we manage the community, and we give them roadmaps, and do that.</p>\n<p>But really, by and large, Databricks is a software company that focuses on building software. The fact that some portions of it happened to be open source, that\u2019s just an amazing lead gen machine that makes us be able to walk into accounts and get ahead of the competition because they say, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe know you guys. You guys created Spark.\u00e2\u0080\u009d</p>\n<p>The way I look at the company is build amazing software that you can monetize with enterprise customers. That\u2019s the only way I look at it.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<h3><em><strong>The way I look at the company is build amazing software that you can monetize with enterprise customers. </strong></em><strong>\u00e2\u0080\u0093</strong><strong>Ali Ghodsi</strong></h3>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Armon:</strong> Yeah, our engineering probably looks pretty similar. It\u2019s not an open source side of engineering and then the enterprise side, it\u2019s one team. They just work against two different roadmaps. And some of the features land in open source, some of them land in enterprise, but it\u2019s the same engineering team, same product management team.</p>\n<p><strong>Peter:</strong> Do you guys have a framework for how to think about what goes in open source and not? And is that consistent over time, or for each release, do you debate that?</p>\n<p><strong>Armon:</strong> We articulated something early 2017, which was we think of our split as what\u2019s technical complexity versus what\u2019s organizational. So, if we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re solving for something that\u2019s fundamentally caused by the organization \u00e2\u0080\u0093 you have, for example, a silo between networking and security ops, you have a collaboration problem now. Or you have a PKI (public key infrastructure) team that\u2019s distinct from your security team. Those are enterprise things. Versus is it a core technical thing that we\u2019re solving where the tool fundamentally needs it? That\u2019s open source.</p>\n<p><strong>Ali:</strong> SaaS software is very different from the Red Hat support and services on-prem. That\u2019s really the big difference for Databricks. What we open source and what we don\u2019t open source doesn\u2019t really matter to our customers because we\u2019re a SaaS company.</p>\n<p>If we were on-prem, it would have been a different business. But because we\u2019re in the cloud, they\u2019re renting the service from us. They\u2019re not trying to run our software. They\u2019re just renting it from us, and they\u2019re paying us rent for that service. They just want us to work in the cloud, and we manage it for them.</p>\n<p>Where it would maybe get iffy is if someone else decides to take all of our software and offer it as well, so it\u2019s just that competitive angle. Otherwise, our customers don\u2019t care. And I think the perfect example of that is Amazon Web Services. People use Amazon Web Services. As an enterprise, they have over a million customers now. They never ask, \u201cHey, is EC2 from Amazon open source? Is S3 from Amazon open source? Is Redshift from Amazon open source?\u201d They\u2019re not. And no one seems to care.</p>\n<p>The truth is when you\u2019re renting a service in the cloud, it\u2019s just a different dynamic. So, we don\u2019t have to worry too much about these things, what becomes open source and what\u2019s not.</p>\n<p><strong>Armon:</strong> I think that\u2019s an interesting thing because we sit in phase 1.0 and you\u2019re phase 2.0. We\u2019re by and large an on-premise desktop software vendor.</p>\n<p><strong>Ali:</strong> This is why we didn\u2019t go to on-prem at Databricks because we wanted to have this model. We didn\u2019t want to have to worry about this. You just rent the service from us in the cloud. That\u2019s it. It\u2019s very inspired by Amazon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s business model rather than the Red Hat model, which is what exists on-prem and is harder to monetize, I think.</p>\n<p><strong>Das:</strong> Since you\u2019re talking about these cloud vendors, you mentioned AWS. Peter said in his presentation, \u201cHey, we\u2019ve maybe over-rotated on this threat.\u201d Agree or disagree with that?</p>\n<p><strong>Armon:</strong> I think it depends on the type of software you run. And what I mean by that is there\u2019s things that are super compelling for the cloud to want to run, and there\u2019s things that maybe they care less about.</p>\n<p>I think about, HashiCorp tooling, for example. Terraform, for example, allows you to consume more cloud. And so, in that sense, anything that allows you to conceive more cloud, wonderful. What do they care? They don\u2019t care if you\u2019re running Windows or Linux or whatever you want to do, if you just draw more power basically. And so, in that sense, is there value in them co-opting Terraform or Consul or Vault and running it themselves? You\u2019re going to run two more extra nodes in Amazon, it\u2019s a rounding error for them.</p>\n<p>By the nature being management tooling, it doesn\u2019t drive what they really monetize, which is CPU hours, network I/O, disk gigs. That\u2019s it. Everything else is just different packaging of that. So, I think it depends where you sit in that and how aligned are you to what the cloud cares about.</p>\n<p>You guys are an interesting case. You sort of drive all three of those, probably heavy users of compute, network, and storage. I think it\u2019s probably a different interest.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<h3><em><strong>What we open source and what we don\u2019t open source doesn\u2019t really matter to our customers because we\u2019re a SaaS company. </strong></em><strong>\u00e2\u0080\u0093</strong><strong>Ali Ghodsi</strong></h3>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Ali:</strong> We don\u2019t get paid on those things. We only get paid on the software. They get a separate bill from the cloud vendors.</p>\n<p>I agree with Peter. I see it differently from the community or the media in how they describe this problem. The way I see it is, basically, there\u2019s a bunch of on-prem vendors, ISVs (independent software vendors), startups like us. They\u00e2\u0080\u0099re running successful open source projects, and then their customer base is moving to the cloud. So, they say, \u201cOkay, we\u2019ll also offer our service in the cloud,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Then they try to offer it in the cloud.</p>\n<p>It turns out it\u2019s actually extremely hard to offer a cloud service, and it takes so many years to get good at it. In our case, we\u2019ve only been in the cloud from the very beginning. We\u2019ve never been on-prem. We\u2019re good at running cloud services. There\u2019s no problem in offering services that has a lot of value to customers and they pay you for it. And we can run it really well in the cloud.</p>\n<p>As an example of that, we had a proprietary thing called Delta, which had massive adoption in the last few years. It\u2019s completely proprietary, and we decided to open source it this year. We open sourced it with completely liberal open licenses with no shenanigans in there. You don\u2019t need to freak out and be afraid of the cloud vendors if you know how to run a cloud service. But it\u2019s hard to run a cloud service.</p>\n<p>Running the SaaS model has been very hard. It took a long time to get good at it. When we did the shift over to start monetizing it, you tell your engineers, \u201cHey, dude. Can you have this pager duty? I might have to wake you up at 3 a.m. if the thing goes down.\u201d And then they\u2019re like, \u201cWhat? I don\u2019t want to.\u201d It\u2019s like, \u201cYeah, you\u2019re on-call. This is the rotation. You have to wake up at 4 a.m. Between 4 and 6, you\u2019re covering if there\u2019s any outage or security breach and so on.\u201d</p>\n<p>That\u2019s the hard thing that we have to do, which the on-prem vendors don\u2019t have to do for their service. Because it\u2019s the responsibility of the IT department of that private data center of your customer to handle outages, security breaches, SLAs. Whereas in our case, we had to tell our engineers, \u201cHey, sorry. It\u2019s why you\u2019re getting paid the big bucks. Carry this pager.\u201d</p>\n<p><strong>Armon:</strong> It feels like there\u2019s an interesting analogy, which is there was an era where as everything went from hardware to software, you saw the hardware companies really struggle. Because, fundamentally, if your core competency is hardware, it doesn\u2019t translate super well to software. And I think as you go from being a software vendor to saying, \u201cHey, I want to be a cloud service provider,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the skillset, the core competency of writing and developing software actually doesn\u2019t translate that well into being good operationally. It\u2019s a completely different skillset.</p>\n<p>As you go through from being from a software vendor into saying, \u201cI want to be a cloud SaaS vendor,\u201d you might find that actually your internal core competency isn\u2019t there.</p>\n<p><strong>Peter:</strong> My sort of opinion on this. It\u2019s very hard to do both. And many startups are tempted to do both so that we have optionality. \u201cHey, a customer can buy in any case, right?\u00e2\u0080\u009d But I think you guys have pointed out a very important part here that doing both is really, really hard to do as a large company, let alone as a startup.</p>\n<p><strong>Ali:</strong> The misunderstanding is, in the media, they say, \u201cOh, these big cloud vendors, they\u2019re just taking other people\u2019s open source software and not contributing anything back and just exploiting that.\u201d What they forget to tell you is they\u2019re really, really good at running that software in the cloud, and almost no one else can do it. That\u2019s really hard to do. And they\u2019re getting paid the big bucks for that. That\u2019s what they don\u2019t tell you because, it ruins the villain and hero story.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<h3><em><strong>You don\u2019t need to freak out and be afraid of the cloud vendors if you know how to run a cloud service. But it\u2019s hard to run a cloud service. </strong></em><strong>\u00e2\u0080\u0093</strong><strong>Ali Ghodsi</strong></h3>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Das:</strong> That speaks to the fact that there\u2019s a lot more nuance to the relationship between an open source company and a cloud vendor than maybe what we see in the media. How have you or how have you seen other open source companies navigate the nuance of a cloud vendor relationship or other partnerships around open source?</p>\n<p><strong>Ali:</strong> I think you can partner with them. They\u2019re good partners. We have an extremely close partnership with Microsoft. We also have a good partnership with Amazon and other cloud vendors. You can partner with them.</p>\n<p>All these workloads on the planet are moving into the cloud. There\u2019s just so much for us all to eat. Figure out what the cloud vendors are good at. Let them add value there. Look at where they\u2019re not adding value, you can go there and focus on that, and then partner with them. It\u2019s a win/win situation. You can do that.</p>\n<p>I do think one has to figure out how to align with them. And I think one mistake a lot of big companies are doing is they don\u2019t align their sales force comp models to be compatible with the big company\u2019s comp model.</p>\n<p>The way it works at Databricks is our customers get two bills \u00e2\u0080\u0094 one bill from the cloud vendor and then one bill from us. They get a bill for the hardware storage, the watts, from the cloud vendors, and they get a bill from us on the software. The reason that is really important is that that other bill that they get from the cloud vendors is actually paying the sales compensation of the cloud company sales people. Hence, they like us. So, they partner with us in the field in every account.</p>\n<p>However, if we changed the pricing model so that they don\u2019t get paid, then they would hate us and block us from all the accounts. That\u2019s a minor nuance that some companies haven\u2019t figured out and they end up in a really fierce competitive situation with the cloud vendors. We don\u2019t have that problem. The cloud vendors are very friendly to us.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<h3><em><strong>One mistake a lot of big companies are doing is they don\u2019t align their sales force comp models to be compatible with the big company\u2019s comp model.</strong></em><strong>\u00e2\u0080\u0093Ali Ghodsi</strong></h3>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Das:</strong> I want to zoom in a little bit and put Peter in the hot seat. He shared that four-stage funnel from developer community management, to product management, to the lead gen and sales dev, and then to sales. I\u2019m curious, how has that played out for you? Has that held true? What parts didn\u2019t necessarily hold true?</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://info.a16z.com/register-for-open-source-download.html\"><img alt=\"OSS deck\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-295599\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"250\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/OSS-Ad.jpg?resize=886%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" width=\"886\"/></a></p>\n<p><strong>Armon:</strong> I think it goes through those exact phases that Peter laid out. Those phases actually map pretty well into the funnel as well. At that early phase of product market fit, it\u2019s a lot about developer advocacy, building the community, things like that.</p>\n<p>As you go into repeatable sales cycle, that only works if you have a tight fit between product management and product marketing in terms of, \u201cOkay, great. We need the features customers are asking for and then we should tell them about that.\u00e2\u0080\u009d There has to be an integration there in that phase.</p>\n<p>Then as you start going to scale, you get to those phases 3 and 4 in the funnel to really be able to amplify that message and bring in the cloud partners as part of your channel.</p>\n<p>I think the only thing that we experienced slightly differently would be in that fourth phase. You laid out that start with SaaS self-service, then go departmental, then go enterprise. For us, it\u2019s always been exactly the opposite.</p>\n<p>Again, I think it\u2019s because we were sort of a phase 1.0 versus a phase 2.0.</p>\n<p><strong>Peter:</strong> I also think it depends on what product you\u2019re actually selling. Your value may not accrete to an individual user, in which case, I just want to make it clear, you may not have that line because the product doesn\u2019t support that line.</p>\n<p>Many companies start with field sales first. It was an example of how to layer it up, as opposed to every company ought to be that.</p>\n<p><strong>Armon:</strong> But I think it goes to your point of having a framework in terms of what you decide goes open versus enterprise. Because as I described our framework, our dividing line is what accretes to an individual \u00e2\u0080\u0094 well, that\u2019s open source. And what accretes to an enterprise?</p>\n<p>Because of the divide we use in product management, it\u2019s very hard for us to have a sort of self-service model.</p>\n<p><strong>Peter:</strong> There is no self-service. That\u2019s given away for free. You could look at that bottom curve and say, \u201cThis is the open source line.\u201d</p>\n<p><strong>Armon:</strong> Bingo.</p>\n<p><strong>Peter:</strong> \u201cIt\u2019s not dollars per customer,\u201d whatever the y-axis would be. And then you\u2019d build your revenue model on top of that.</p>\n<p><strong>Armon:</strong> Exactly. For us, once you acknowledge that\u2019s the divide, it makes sense to start on the enterprise side.</p>\n<p><strong>Ali:</strong> In an article that Peter wrote in 2013 \u00e2\u0080\u0093 that was the same time we started Databricks \u00e2\u0080\u0093 he really accentuated the big difference between this Red Hat model and the SaaS model. And it really resonated with us. We really thought this on-prem, Red Hat open source model is dead. It\u2019s bad. We looked down on it. We didn\u2019t wanna have anything to do with it.</p>\n<p>We really saw this sort of SaaS model as extremely powerful. And it\u2019s pretty prescient because 2012-13 AWS was not the huge phenomenon it is today. Now, it\u2019s absolutely exploded. It\u2019s like taken over the whole planet.</p>\n<p>So, agree with it, but the thing that I would really emphasize is the difference between SaaS and non-SaaS makes a huge difference. I think churn is higher if you\u2019re not SaaS. I think net expansion rates are lower. I think everything is worse if you\u2019re not SaaS. Because what can happen\u2026</p>\n<p>I\u2019ll give you an example. I\u2019m not gonna name the names. But basically, there was an open source vendor \u00e2\u0080\u0093 this is one of those cases where the open source software actually had two companies fighting over it. They had contributors. One would run it on-prem and give support and services. What would happen is after a couple years, the customer would keep the software, because it\u2019s free, but then migrate and get support from the other cheaper vendor. But keep the same software.</p>\n<p>That you can\u2019t do with SaaS services. If you don\u2019t want to have a contract with us, we would shut down the service. You can\u2019t use it anymore.</p>\n<p>And then what they would do is they get the cheaper vendor. And then after a couple years, they would not even renew with the cheaper vendor because they would say, \u201cI actually hired your support guy into my company. So, I don\u2019t need to buy any support from you anymore. And I\u2019m still going to keep the software.\u201d With SaaS, you can\u2019t do that. So, churn ends up being lower. Expansion rates are higher. Everything is just better.</p>\n<p><strong>Peter:</strong> It\u2019s super interesting as I think about it, well, there\u2019s an exact example of commodity. All this software has been developed, and yet it\u2019s total commodity that I can basically go from one vendor to another to hiring a person to actually support this thing. That\u2019s what was happening during that era when I mentioned the difference between open source valuation versus proprietary. This was exactly that characteristic that propagated that particular dynamic.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<h3><em><strong>Red Hat is a great company. It\u2019s just very hard for a startup to go replicate what they have done because their value-add is the scale. And the thing that startups don\u2019t do very well is scale because you don\u2019t have the money to go and do that. </strong></em><strong>\u00e2\u0080\u0093</strong><strong>Peter Levine, a16z</strong></h3>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Ali:</strong> Open source, the software itself has zero intrinsic value. Anyone can download it.</p>\n<p>What these companies were selling, their value was support and services, which quickly gets commoditized. And it boils down to who can do that most efficiently where on the planet and they can manage that P&amp;L.</p>\n<p><strong>Armon:</strong> And any other company like Red Hat, which has a scale advantage.</p>\n<p><strong>Peter:</strong> Exactly. That\u2019s their value add. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a scale advantage to do exactly that.</p>\n<p><strong>Das:</strong> For people who aren\u2019t familiar with that article from back in 2013, could you give kind of a quick summary\u00e2\u0080\u00a6</p>\n<p><strong>Peter:</strong> The title of this blog was \u201cWhy There Will Never Be Another Red Hat.\u00e2\u0080\u009d And I made the argument, to Ali\u2019s point, that the support model was pretty broken at the time. And thinking about going to a service, to an open source service model, hosted service, was a way to really uncover and accentuate the value of the product that you\u2019re bringing to the market.</p>\n<p>That\u2019s basically all the points that we argued here. Red Hat, they had the scale and capacity to go and do that. Don\u2019t get me wrong, Red Hat is a great company. It\u2019s just very hard for a startup to go replicate what they have done because their value-add is the scale. And the thing that startups don\u2019t do very well is scale because you don\u2019t have the money to go and do that. So, it\u2019s counterproductive on that dimension.</p>\n<p><strong>Armon:</strong> It\u2019s like trying to compete with Procter &amp; Gamble on distribution.</p>\n<p><strong>Peter:</strong> Exactly, you can\u2019t do that as a startup.</p>\n<p><strong>Ali:</strong> SaaS also is killing that business model even more. The thing that\u2019s weird about Red Hat is that of all the open source companies that existed for some reason, that people can analyze and debate forever, they ended up being a monopoly without really any fierce competition, which is generally not true about open source software. Because the software has zero intrinsic value, you end up getting lots of competitors, which commoditizes the price and brings it down.</p>\n<p>But with the cloud vendors now, you\u2019re much more unlikely to have a monopoly like they had because if you offer free software that you\u2019re just distributing, they can also pick it up and offer it. So, it\u2019s very unlikely there\u2019ll ever be another Red Hat because of that.</p>\n<p><strong>Das:</strong>So, what practical advice might you give to an entrepreneur starting down that journey?</p>\n<p><strong>Armon:</strong> Having done on-prem, I\u2019d say skip on-prem. Go straight to SaaS. Save yourself.</p>\n<p>The advantages that Ali has talked about around the SaaS model are very true. And to Peter\u2019s point about changing competence being very hard, if you go down the road of building software competence and then realize you want to switch to SaaS competence, which is very much the bucket we\u2019re in, to be honest, you realize it\u2019s a hard shift. It is a different skillset. It\u2019s a different set of practices. And so the earlier you can do that, ideally at inception, the easier your life will be. The further you get down one road, the harder and more painful that shift really is.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<h3><em><strong>Infrastructure software isn\u2019t like, \u201cHey, I\u2019m gonna bang it out over a week and launch my cool new app and put it on Hacker News.\u201d You spend years building this stuff. </strong></em><strong>\u00e2\u0080\u0093</strong><strong>Armon Dadgar</strong></h3>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Ali:</strong> For me, I would say SaaS is obviously the one. I definitely would just start with SaaS. Wall Street likes SaaS and gives you higher multiples. You get a higher valuation, so there\u2019s that as well.</p>\n<p>But ignoring that aspect, what do you want your company to do? Which space do you pick? And the way I think about it is you have to expect these three cloud vendors \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Amazon, Microsoft, Google \u00e2\u0080\u0094 they each have roughly $100 billion of cash sitting around. They actually have a printing press that\u2019s not the cloud business. They either have an ad business as a printing press or they have the Windows or something server business that is a printing press, or they have a retail of everything on the planet as a printing press.</p>\n<p>You should just assume that they\u2019re gonna get really, really good at the lower levels of the stack. And the lower levels of the stack, there aren\u2019t that many things. There\u2019s machines, there\u2019s storage, there\u2019s networking, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s some databases. That\u2019s it. You move up the stack a little bit, you start having much more.</p>\n<p>As you move up the stack, it gets more and more verticalized. It actually becomes a lot of different things, a lot of different products. The cloud vendors can\u2019t win all of those. They can dominate and crush and just completely own the bottom layers. The higher up you go, there\u2019s gonna be a lot of vendors. Otherwise, if I\u2019m wrong about the statement, there will only be three companies on the whole planet in software. That\u2019s very unlikely.</p>\n<p>So, pick a space higher up in the stack. Competition will be much less. It\u2019s going to be much more verticalized. Go with SaaS and you\u2019ll probably be very successful.</p>\n<p><strong>Das:</strong> I did want to touch on briefly kind of your backgrounds and the origin of open source as well as your own start in academia. Those two have been really tightly linked. Now, with commercializing open source, what does that relationship look like? How are academia and open source connected in your mind?</p>\n<p><strong>Armon:</strong> One of the interesting things about academia is going back forever, it\u2019s always had this ethos of \u00e2\u0080\u009cit\u2019s free software.\u00e2\u0080\u009d It\u2019s publicly funded. You\u2019re getting government grants to pay for this stuff. So, you\u2019re naturally giving it out or your code is there so other people can reproduce the work and extend it and add on to it. If you spend time in that, you soak in that ethos, that notion that the software is free and other people collaborate and extend it and remix it becomes normal. It doesn\u2019t seem weird.</p>\n<p>Infrastructure software isn\u2019t like, \u201cHey, I\u2019m gonna bang it out over a week and launch my cool new app and put it on Hacker News.\u201d You spend years building this stuff and really getting it to a point of broad usability, scalability, etc. And where are the environments where you can spend years and years working on a thing? You have that luxury in academia to be able to do that. And so the first few years of development take place at a university. Then it becomes an industrial project from there. But it would be very hard to boot strap some of the stuff from zero in an industrial setting.</p>\n<p><strong>Ali:</strong> I actually think academia is misconfigured. I\u2019m an adjunct professor, so I wear that hat, too. But I think in the systems research field, it\u2019s misconfigured. There\u2019s a huge opportunity for academia to come in and completely disrupt the software scene. But the way it\u2019s configured right now is, as academics, we get incentivized on publishing papers in the top conferences and that\u2019s what we focus on typically.</p>\n<p>If the focus was on pushing the boundaries of what software you can build and disrupt the world with it, all these universities with all these students that have five years to sit and create the open source project could completely disrupt how software is done on the planet. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a gigantic opportunity for any university to take on.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<h3><em><strong>If the focus was on pushing the boundaries of what software you can build and disrupt the world with it, all these universities with all these students that have five years to sit and create the open source project could completely disrupt how software is done. </strong></em><strong>\u00e2\u0080\u0093</strong><strong>Ali Ghodsi</strong></h3>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Berkeley actually did it to our credit. We pushed forward on that with some of these labs that we had like AMPLab, RISELab. But it\u2019s just scratching the surface.</p>\n<p>There is a scenario if all the universities figured this out, which they haven\u2019t, that they could completely start owning the software space. It could become the future of how software has developed. It\u2019s basically open source projects that the different universities are leading. That\u2019s not happening right now.</p>\n<p><strong>Das:</strong> So, time for a last question. What area of open source right now is the most fascinating to you? Where do you think the most interesting things are happening?</p>\n<p><strong>Ali:</strong> So, I\u2019m gonna kinda not answer that by saying: data, the value of data and the ecosystem around it, how you can buy it, how you can sell it, how you can leverage it, and the models that interpret that data.</p>\n<p>We used to think of hardware, software and so on. I think data is the next thing. A lot of people have said it, it\u2019s the new oil. But we\u2019re just in the beginning of that. It\u2019s the early innings of how there\u2019s going to be an economy forming around data itself. And it\u2019s already happening. So, that\u2019s fascinating.</p>\n<p>I think the next third wave of interesting market trend that you\u2019re going to see in the software space, the software will be free, but who has the data and the models around that, that\u2019s going to be the competitive edge.</p>\n<p><strong>Armon:</strong> I have always personally been a bit of a systems guy, so I love following what\u2019s happening in database research land. To me, it\u2019s been interesting because RDBMS has ruled the world for decades and decades. And I think what\u2019s finally happening is you\u2019re either seeing shifts because of scale \u00e2\u0080\u0093 you\u2019re no longer saying, \u201cokay, let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fit all the data on one machine. I need to fundamentally go to a clustered architecture.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Or now as we think about IoT, Edge, Fog computing, whatever you wanna call it, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s these notions of hierarchical levels of data where you might have high bandwidth, high throughput cloud data centers and then go out to an Akamai or Fastly POP and then go out to someone\u2019s house and then go out to your phone.</p>\n<p>So, how do you actually design systems that can reconcile and handle data at a planetary scale, much higher volume, much lower latency, and reconcile and do it all in a comprehensible way? That\u2019s a fascinating space in terms of is RDBMS finally being challenged as supreme when it comes to data management?</p>\n<p><strong>Peter:</strong> I think one of the fascinating elements of open source is the origination of projects now. These stats have Google doing 2,000 projects and all of that. Maybe that\u2019s part of the answer. I love your academic comment. It may not happen there, but the fact that all of these companies are really built on large backbones of open source and are releasing these projects into the market where there\u2019s not a lot of strategic value to them, I think it\u2019s incredible. It\u2019s unlocking a huge number of opportunities that I think will very much dominate the landscape as we roll into the future. That\u2019s really interesting.</p>\n<p><strong>Das:</strong> I want to thank you, thank the panelists.

I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m Hanne. We\u2019re talking today about what is happening to oncology and to patients going through cancer treatment today during the outbreak of coronavirus\u00e2\u0080\u0094how treatment is affected, what kind of clinical decisions oncologists are having to make, and what happens to oncology as a whole when it\u2019s forced in this moment to go so virtual. Joining myself and Vineeta Agarwala, physician and general partner at a16z are Dr. Bobby Green, MD (Community Oncologist; Chief Medical Officer, Flatiron Health) (the first voice you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll hear) and Dr. Sumit Shah MD, MPH (Oncologist; Head of Digital Health, Stanford Cancer Center).</em></p>\n<p>Hanne: We\u2019re here today because coronavirus is now disrupting the entire health care system, not just because of the burden of dealing with the actual disease itself, but because of everything else that\u2019s had to grind to a halt. One of those areas where we really worry about things coming to a total stop like that is, of course, cancer treatment, which can often feel like a race against the clock even under the best conditions. So, can we just start by talking about the biggest issues that your cancer patients are facing right now? How are they handling this?</p>\n<p>Dr. Green: I\u2019ve been sort of, I guess, surprised how much more resilience I\u2019ve actually seen among a lot of my patients, and maybe it\u2019s just because they\u2019ve lived through so much uncertainty and gone through so much as part of their diagnosis that, you know, this is just one more thing. But I do think people have been remarkably resilient and, in fact, in some ways, a lot more so and maybe more laid back about this than some of my, you know, healthy friends and colleagues who haven\u2019t had to deal with any health crisis.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s been a little bit of confusion about what does it mean for my treatments and uncertainty about timing, because I think none of us really know how long is this going to last and how long is the world going to look like this. And then, also, uncertainty about jobs and, you know, most people have their health insurances, we all know if they\u2019re not on Medicare, their place of employment, and that\u2019s a concern as well.</p>\n<p>Dr. Agarwala: I\u2019d totally echo what you said about resilience, Bobby. I had a patient last week who told our team that, you know, they can empathize with what everybody is going through, because it\u2019s exactly what they felt like every time they had chemotherapy, that they\u2019re suddenly susceptible to infection and that they have to be careful. And that was, like, their dominant reflection is that I understand why everyone is afraid, and I felt that fear myself, which was incredibly sort of empathic and a resilient thing for somebody to say you could have been worrying entirely about their own care.</p>\n<p>Hanne: It feels like, from the outside, you\u2019d imagine that would almost double that, you know, that you\u2019d get sort of extra doses of that fear instead of almost being, like, inoculated against it because you\u2019ve gotten so used to it. That\u2019s really inspiring.</p>\n<p>Dr. Shah: I will agree with you guys that, I think, most of our patients have been incredibly resilient and understanding of the current time, but I\u2019ve also had a fair number of patients telling me, \u201cDr. Shah, my cancer can\u2019t shelter in place, what do I do right now,\u201d which is a very poignant point as well. So I think a lot of the patients are wondering about the timing of chemotherapy, \u201cShould I initiate chemotherapy? Should I delay chemotherapy? What are the risks of doing so? Am I going to put my body at higher jeopardy for becoming immunocompromised? Or am I going to lead my body at higher risk for this coming back in the future?\u201d So these are very difficult decisions to kind of make, And we don\u2019t have a whole lot of data to help us support that decision-making capacity, so a lot of this is done on a case-by-case basis.</p>\n<p>Dr. Agarwala: A lot of providers are discussing the Lancet paper about a relatively small cohort of 18 cancer patients who got infected with coronavirus across China and looking at outcomes and results there. You know, our data that are emerging like this factoring into your decision-making and into the decisions that cancer centers across the country are making, that data was, of course, limited, but it did suggest increased morbidity even among patients who are not actively immunosuppressed. How are you guys thinking about data like this and also about generating data within your centers?</p>\n<p>Dr. Shah: We do, in general, think that cancer patients are probably more susceptible to viruses in general. they\u2019re also more likely to get more serious complications. So I think we do have to be very ginger about what types of treatments we\u2019re giving our patients, and we know that, for patients who are at higher risk for complications, we may be able to give them more support in terms of medications that can maybe decrease the risk of their immune system being compromised. So I think it is a valid concern, and I think that most of our treatments can affect patients in terms of their immune system. And we have to be very cognizant of how we\u2019re treating those patents.</p>\n<p>Hanne: So let\u2019s get into those kinds of clinical decisions that patients are facing right now. There must be an enormous amount of gray area. Is there any kind of broad framework in place, or is it really on a case-by-case basis?</p>\n<p>Dr. Shah: We broadly categorize treatments in terms of curative intent versus palliative intent. Curative intent meaning that you\u2019re initiating chemotherapy or immunotherapy or any surgery, for instance, to be able to cure that patient from cancer. Palliative is thinking about treatments more in terms of improving patient\u2019s symptoms or helping them to live longer, but we know that, for the majority of these patients, they won\u2019t be able to be cured from this condition. So there had been some larger frameworks about saying that, for patients who are undergoing curative intent chemotherapy that we should go forward with that because the risks of recurrence could be, you know, causing a great deal of harm for those patients. However, for palliative patients maybe we should be a little bit more ginger about starting chemotherapy, which may dampen their immune system in the short run while we\u2019re facing a higher risk from coronavirus.</p>\n<p>Dr. Green: I think almost everything we do in oncology is looking at, you know, risks and benefits of various treatments, and I think, you know, most decisions we make are based on that calculation. And what\u2019s so interesting now is you have a whole new set of risks with COVID, right. Some of that is, like, you take a risk by walking out of your house in the morning, which certainly wasn\u2019t the case. You take a risk by walking in the clinic. You know, we take for granted that if someone gets sick and needs to go to the hospital, we have a good hospital for them, but if someone needs an ICU bed or needed a ventilator for something, is that going to be available? So, you know, spend a lot of time just trying to think about these risks, a lot of which are, you know, very uncertain in how those play into those treatment decisions about starting someone on adjuvant therapy or starting someone on, you know, palliative therapy.</p>\n<p>Dr. Agarwala: Several of the guideline organizations that guide cancer care in this country, like ASCO, have put out relatively broad statements outlining the role of coronavirus factoring into decision-making with respect to both curative intent and palliative intent chemotherapy, with respect to timing of bone marrow transplantation, for example, recommending that such a procedure potentially be delayed for patients, thinking about adjuvant therapy, but most of the guidance has left a lot of room for interpretation. And so I\u2019m curious, how are you personalizing that guidance?</p>\n<p>Dr. Green: I think ASCO has done a really nice job of, you know, responding to this and putting out information, but at the end of the day, at least from where I sit, most of the recommendations have been use your clinical judgment and take into account,\u201d you know, again, going back to that sort of risk-benefit framework. So I\u2019ll give you a couple examples.</p>\n<p>I saw someone this week who was an early-stage lung cancer patient who I had seen at the end of February and we planned to give him adjuvant chemotherapy, and we just had our second discussion today, and you know, we went from the conversation about what\u2019s the benefit of adjuvant chemotherapy and should we go through with this in February before any of us were really thinking of coronavirus, And then we had the conversation twice over the last week and a half, and the framework shifted, right. Like, it made sense to do it at the end of February both to me and to the patient, and it no longer made sense, because the absolute benefit that we\u2019re going to see for this when you compound it with the risk of \u201cHe\u2019s going to need to come into the office frequently, it\u2019s going to be harder and harder for him to stay isolated. What happens if he has a side effect or toxicity that puts him in the hospital? What are the additional risk factors for him being immunosuppressed because he\u2019s having chemotherapy?\u201d It just didn\u2019t make sense to do that.</p>\n<p>Now, he was a stage 1B lung cancer, and he was high risk, but it\u2019s a situation in which, you know, you would go back and forth, to begin with, about whether to give adjuvant chemotherapy. I\u2019ve had patients on bone modifying agents. These are drugs that are supportive drugs that are typically used in a variety of diseases, but while there\u2019s benefit, the benefit accrues over a long period of time, and I\u2019ve pushed those off because, you know, again, I don\u2019t know that there\u2019s a right or wrong answer, but in my judgment, the risk of them stepping out of their house and coming into the clinic probably doesn\u2019t make sense.</p>\n<p>Dr. Shah: Most practitioners would probably continue with the chemotherapy for patients who are young and otherwise fit and doing well with treatment. For patients where you\u2019ve had a deep remission, now, one year, two years beyond treatment, for a lot of those patients, we can probably safely stop treatment at that time, and hopefully, the patients will continue to remain in remission. So it really depends on where the patient is and what kind of response they\u2019ve had, but it also depends on the type of cancer they have. We know that there is a significant amount of heterogeneity between cancers, so not all cancers are graded equal by any means. So in each situation, we have to kind of do the risk-benefit calculation, and make sure that it\u2019s in the best interest of the patient.</p>\n<p>Dr. Agarwala: Are questions like this coming up at our tumor boards? Who is the group that you\u2019re able to engage in real time on such difficult decisions for individual patients?</p>\n<p>Dr. Green: Well, Vineeta, as one of my seven Twitter followers, you may have seen that I actually\u2026</p>\n<p>Dr. Agarwala: I saw that you crowdsourced that. Well done.</p>\n<p>Dr. Green: Yeah, I crowdsourced the early-stage lung cancer question today. There\u2019s just been\u2026we have a multidisciplinary lung tumor board, Vineeta, where these questions have come up, a lot of curbsiding other docs, that\u2019s been my experience.</p>\n<p>I think what\u2019s really interesting about the problems we\u2019re facing is there\u2019s sort of the art and the science of medicine, and this is really one of those circumstances that the art of medicine and judgment and how to apply sort of knowledge about data to great areas of uncertainty really comes into play. And it\u2019s been intellectually challenging to do so.</p>\n<p>Hanne: I\u2019m glad you brought up Twitter, because I\u2019m wondering, is that a viable kind of tool for you guys for crowdsourcing for even anecdotal, you know, data, advice, decision-making in this area?</p>\n<p>Dr. Green: I\u2019ve personally found the discussions on Twitter about this to be really helpful and really informative. So, to me, yes. And you, obviously, you know, you can only give\u2026you have to be a little bit more general than you would like to be for PHI reasons, obviously. But I find it very useful.</p>\n<p>I actually think that Twitter is probably the best source of medical information right now as oncologist. The majority of data that I\u2019m actually receiving, I\u2019m receiving in real time from my Twitter feed as opposed to waiting for publications to come out. So it\u2019s actually been very, very helpful to have access to Twitter. It\u2019s just been a tremendous communication tool from experts around the country and the world, in general.</p>\n<p>Dr. Shah: We\u2019ve been using our tumor boards to discuss a lot of these cases. As we were alluding to earlier that the data is very gray, we really don\u2019t have a lot of information to base these decisions on. There have been consensus statements that have been put out into large publications from thought leaders across the world, and we\u2019ve been using those as a framework by which to make our decisions at Stanford as well. But it\u2019s still very much a gray area. It\u2019s important that we employ shared decision-making with our patients to make sure that they also, you know, feel that they\u2019re a part of this conversation.</p>\n<p>Hanne: It strikes me that a lot of the decisions that you\u2019re talking about making, you already are at a place of understanding to a large degree what you\u2019re dealing with, what kind of cancer how it tends to behave. What about the patients that just found a lump, you know, and were coming to you for the very first step? What are the guidelines there?</p>\n<p>Dr. Shah: The answer to this, in general, will really vary depending on where you are in the country, what kind of health system you\u2019re in right now, and then where we are in the pandemic as well. while I think it\u2019s true that most non-essential procedures and surgeries are being postponed, the suspicion for cancer does increase the prioritization of certain standard procedures. a new breast mass that you may feel in the shower, for instance, that would actually take prioritization to have that worked up. for patients or for men who have an increase in PSA over a slow period of time, they probably don\u2019t need a prostate biopsy right away. So it really will vary on the type of cancer and the type of patient as well, but in general, patients with a cancer suspicion will probably be at a higher prioritization for getting their treatment done.</p>\n<p>Dr. Green: So, at Flatiron Health, among our practices which use our electronic health record, OncoEMR, we\u2019re able to track patient volume, and we saw, last week, a 22% drop in office visits across the network of practices. That also included a 16% drop in visits related to chemotherapy volume.</p>\n<p>I think those are partially shock of the system, let\u2019s reevaluate and see who needs to come in and who doesn\u2019t. But it was pretty impactful. I mean, you know, our numbers across our network are very, very consistent, and then there was just this, you know, big drop last week. A lot of that is just going to be, \u201cWell, hold on, we have to figure out what we\u2019re doing.\u201d I don\u2019t think, necessarily, you\u2019re going to see that much drop in chemotherapy, but I think there\u2019s going to be a lot of really interesting data that\u2019s going to come out of that to try to understand, you know, how this impacted cancer outcomes.</p>\n<p>Dr. Agarwala: And to your point, Bobby, about kind of this being sort of unprecedented shock to the oncology care system for us to really see what kind of an impact happens on visit volume and treatment volume, and you know, some of that may even extend to outcomes. And it may be a really sort of fine-grained sensitivity analysis that we sort of have an opportunity to later look back at and say, \u201cWell, what really happened if, you know, surgery was delayed by this period of time? And how did outcomes change? And what really happened if adjuvant therapy was delayed by this period of time? How did outcomes change?\u201d You know, I think, I hope that, to some extent, some of that may be a silver lining in terms of learning from this crisis.</p>\n<p>Dr. Green: The other sort of interesting thing that\u2019s come out of this is it makes you spend a lot of time thinking how much you really need things that you thought you really needed. Like, you know, usually, this patient comes in and gets blood drawn, and you know, \u201cYeah, I\u2019m going to do this telemedicine visit, and we\u2019re going to skip the blood draw.\u201d And I find myself saying, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, we can do it again in three to six months,\u201d which sort of raises the question, did they really need that blood draw to begin with?</p>\n<p>Dr. Agarwala: Yeah, or that scan or that physical exam. we\u2019ve all felt sort of the sadness when we hear a patient describe their five-hour drive and then their, you know, hour-long wait in the waiting room and then their five-hour drive back, because it\u2019s crazy to try to get a hotel room on the day of their visit, and this kind of logistical nightmare that many patients undergo in order to seek cancer care or seek second opinions or seek clinical trial evaluation. And I think we\u2019ve all wondered, well, could some of this be happening more efficiently and in a more patient-centric way if we were to embrace technology in various ways? And sometimes a crisis is an opportunity for us to embrace that tech stack, and I\u2019ve been sort of floored and amazed at how much of the Stanford oncology clinics are now sort of operating in the telemedicine sphere. I\u2019d love to hear how you guys are managing this. Which patients are you bringing into clinic, which are you managing via telemedicine?</p>\n<p>Dr. Green: I mean, I think the whole remote care telemedicine, virtual medicine, you know, I did my first telemedicine session, and I finished it, and my thought was, \u201cWhere have you been all my life?\u201d It was, I mean, just phenomenal.</p>\n<p>Dr. Agarwala: Your patient might have had the same thoughts.</p>\n<p>Dr. Green: Yeah, I know, right? Like, that was easy. the easy answer is, you know, routine follow-up. So the patients who were coming in for routine follow-ups who didn\u2019t want to reschedule or push back, I\u2019ve done those over telemedicine, and that\u2019s been relatively easy and relatively straightforward. I\u2019ve also had a couple other patients who weren\u2019t routine follow-up, but I wanted to try to keep out of the office. I\u2019m thinking about a couple of patients, for example, with a disease called chronic lymphocytic leukemia who were on relatively new therapies were coming in to get their blood counts checked, so they weren\u2019t just routine follow-ups. But given the changing circumstances, I felt relatively comfortable doing a telemedicine visit, making sure they\u2019re okay, and pushing back their lab results for a few weeks. Where you obviously can\u2019t do it is on people who need treatment, so people who need medicines to boost up their blood counts to keep their blood counts from getting too low. There are ways you can give those at home, but for patients who are getting it in the office, sometimes it\u2019s just not easy to get that quickly done.</p>\n<p>And then, the regulations around using FaceTime and Skype and other non-HIPAA compliant platforms has been listed, at least for the time being. So I\u2019ve had a couple of circumstances where I\u2019ve just FaceTimed patients to do those.</p>\n<p>Dr. Shah: We\u2019ve really dramatically scaled up the virtual clinics in our clinics in the last two weeks, which is quite ironic, because we\u2019ve actually had virtual capabilities for over a year now. but it\u2019s literally taken a pandemic to do this. utilization by virtual is around 5% to 10% of our clinic visits over the past year, but now, over the last week, it\u2019s now greater than 60% of our visits are actually now all virtual, which is quite extraordinary, yeah. And really, we have this alignment for the first time, actually, where we actually have an alignment between providers, patients, and now even payers as CMS changed their laws in the past week to allow for reimbursement for telemedicine and virtual medicine. So that\u2019s really changed the landscape completely, and so now we\u2019re seeing a huge rise in our ability to deliver virtual care.</p>\n<p>Hanne: So we had a podcast recently where we talked quite a bit about using virtual medicine and telemedicine tools for primary care and sort of triaging symptoms from your home. Are there particular pressure points that you\u2019re noticing from the specialist point of view where things aren\u2019t working so well, where there are sticking points or where the data flow gets messed up?</p>\n<p>Dr. Green: Part of the thing, you know, oncology is, you know, you administer therapies to patients, and a lot of those therapies, it\u2019s sort of hard to do in a remote setting. I think, from the oncology standpoint, that\u2019s a barrier. The other area which I\u2019ve sort of seen, and again, this has been in a limited experience, is, you know, there are often difficult discussions you have, and I think we\u2019re all accustomed to delivering those difficult discussions in person and the ability to have physical contact. I think that\u2019s been a tough part of remote oncology.</p>\n<p>Hanne: Wow.</p>\n<p>Dr. Shah: So much of oncology is an art form, as you were saying, And it\u2019s really our ability to connect with patient which makes oncology so special and which is why so many of us went into this field in the first place. But it\u2019s very difficult to do that virtually. As much as I love an emoji, you know, I think an embrace after giving someone good news is much more wanted by us. And we also know that the physical exam, as you were saying, is also very limited for these virtual visits. we do have some limitations, especially where the physical exam can be a little more important, such as gynecological cancers like endometrial cancer or cervical cancer.</p>\n<p>Dr. Agarwala: What could be better? Like, if you had to brainstorm a feature list for the platforms that you\u2019ve tried, what would help?</p>\n<p>Dr. Shah: On our current platform, we can\u2019t share screens nearly as easily. So I always try to tell a patient about a long nodule and he wanted to see it actually on his CT scan, so I actually had to take a mirror and show him his lung scans through the reflection on the mirror, which I thought was extraordinary in 2020 that we can\u2019t do this quite yet.</p>\n<p>Hanne: How about the sharing of information like provider to provider or specialist to specialist? That\u2019s something that our partner, Julie Yoo, brought up on the last podcast as being, you know, still not seamless with the data flow of these telemedicine tools.</p>\n<p>Dr. Green: Well, I mean, I\u2019ll give you an example today that happened to me as one of my patients who I didn\u2019t think I was going to need to examine said, \u201cOh, I have this thing on my back,\u201d and turned around and tried to show me this thing on his back. And it was\u2026which as an aside, there had been a lot of sort of comical technology-related things that have happened in the last week and a half too.</p>\n<p>Hanne: Like, what? Like, I can\u2019t even\u2026would you put your phone on your cabinet and, like, turn around and take your shirt off? I can\u2019t even really imagine how that\u2026</p>\n<p>Dr. Green: Well, like, this was one trying to turn around and show, you know, my patient trying to show me a picture of his lower back and called his wife in and not being able to see where he was. Another patient who just wasn\u2019t really used to using the phone on his camera, and he kept putting his camera up against his ear so I could see the inside of his ear, but not the\u2026you know. you assume that everyone in the world uses technology like you do, and you quickly find out that that is, you know, not the case. Like, people who don\u2019t, you know, aren\u2019t sure what to do with a hyperlink. So that\u2019s been sort of interesting, but I\u2019ve had some nice laughs with my patient around this as well.</p>\n<p>So some of this are sort of growing pains and grow-out pains. But maybe, in the future, if a cancer patient was expecting a certain fraction of their visits to be over telehealth, you know, maybe that adaption curve would look different.</p>\n<p>Dr. Green: Yes. So, I mean, I\u2019ll just give you one example for a feature that would have been nice. So this patient, who I just told you about, who had this thing on his back, I couldn\u2019t get a clear enough picture on the video. He actually took a picture of it with his camera and then emailed it to me. I looked at it. I thought I knew what it probably was, then went through a long and arduous process of communicating with his dermatologist who he was supposed to see next week and sending him the image. Boy, wouldn\u2019t it have been nice if I could have taken the image right from the telehealth platform, sent it over to his dermatologist, and messaged his dermatologist on the same platform, \u201cHey, can you take a look at this and let me know what you think?\u201d To me, it\u2019s all, like, the biggest problem, from my perspective, to solve is not just telehealth, but I think everything is, you know, real-time or fast communication between clinicians, whether it\u2019s colleagues or second opinions or docs you refer to. That\u2019s the biggest pain point for me, which, you know, ultimately, could be solved partially with this.</p>\n<p>Dr. Agarwala: a couple of the observations that I had watching some of these telehealth visits take place were just kind of how open and comfortable a lot of the patients seemed chatting over a video visit. my sense is that some of that is because applications like FaceTime and other video chatting applications are just so much more prevalent today that a lot of patients don\u2019t feel like it\u2019s quite as awkward as you might have anticipated. it was actually interesting to get a glimpse into how they\u2019re functioning and what they\u2019re doing and the fact that they\u2019re running in from the kitchen, you know, you kind of get a sense, actually, of a patient\u2019s mobility and comfort level with their ADLs, activities of daily living, in a way that you can\u2019t sometimes get when they\u2019re sitting on an exam table. So I think it\u2019s been interesting to see that we might actually learn about patients in a way that is hard to do when they come to the clinic.</p>\n<p>Dr. Green: Yeah. You know, Vineeta, it\u2019s funny you say that. I mean, I, like, found one of the really useful thing to see people in their own environments and in their homes, one thing I have always liked to do with patients is I\u2019ll ask them to bring in pictures of themselves, either when they were younger or before they were sick. And I was, you know, telehealthing with one patient, and she was sort of sitting in a desk. And behind her, she had like a million family photos all hanging on the wall, and I was, like\u2026and I didn\u2019t do it, but I was so tempted to say, \u201cHey, could we, you know, pull a couple of those off and let\u2019s take a look at them?\u201d But you really get insight that you don\u2019t, and I\u2019ve had, like\u2026I literally had 2 patients, 30 seconds into the conversation, say to me, \u201cOh my god, I forgot to put on makeup.\u201d And you know, you just realize, you see people different than you see them when they come into the office.</p>\n<p>Dr. Agarwala: One space that we\u2019ve all heard a lot of discussion about, actually, in the context of coronavirus therapy is our clinical trials that are now, you know, actively enrolling and I think a lot of people started thinking about what a clinical trial is and have heard of the word more than they might have before. But for cancer patients, this is the norm, right. A lot of our cancer patients are always thinking about a trial in the future or they might be on a trial now. We\u2019d love to hear how clinical trial operations are affected by shelter at home orders for so many of our non-essential workforce. How is that playing out for patients on trials or patients considering trials?</p>\n<p>Dr. Shah: The shelter in place has obviously hampered enrollment considerably. We\u2019ve had a tremendous decrease in enrollment over the last couple of weeks, which is very understandable. Patients just don\u2019t want to come to the hospital nearly as much. Adding to that is that a lot of trials are actually holding new recruitment to trials as well. So a lot of the crew was being held right now. For patients currently on trial, they are allowed to continue on treatment, and they are encouraged to do so. They are allowing for more deviations, I mean, that patients can skip treatments if they feel that they need to in order to protect themselves from this virus. So we\u2019re starting to see that sponsorship trials are a lot more lenient than they were in the past. A lot of the trials with oral medications are still being continued, and the sponsors are also being a lot more lenient about shipping drug home so that patients don\u2019t have to come into the hospital.</p>\n<p>I also believe that this is going to cost us to reconsider the way that we do a lot of the clinical trials. It\u2019s really necessary that you get that certain esoteric lab on day 52 of the clinical trial and make the patient come for 4 hours to do that. I think this will make us realize that a lot of the things that we\u2019re doing are probably not as important as we used to think they are.</p>\n<p>Dr. Agarwala: The FDA announced that, you know, they\u2019re working on providing guidance to sponsors and trial sites to enable sufficient regulatory flexibility to allow trials to continue through this period to the extent possible while, of course, keeping patient safety paramount. What are some of the sort of tactical ways in which you think this guidance could play out? And in which do you think there might be more flexibility than there was before?</p>\n<p>Dr. Green: I think the flexibility ultimately helps. You know, there is so much concern about not following protocols exactly to the tee and deviations to that that I think that flexibility is going to get people ultimately more comfortable with having patients on trial during this time. To me, certainly, it\u2019s understandable why things are dropping off. I think it\u2019s also, in many ways, tragic. You know, we, at baseline, don\u2019t put enough patients on clinical trials. It\u2019s such an urgent need, and it\u2019s just disappointing even if understandable to see why that\u2019s dropping off. you probably saw, I think, Pfizer made an announcement that they\u2019re stopping accrual, except for life-threatening conditions. I don\u2019t know if life-threatening applied to every cancer trial that they\u2019re doing or not. for trials where, you know, assuming you have enough staff to keep taking care of patients, if you have a trial that doesn\u2019t require visits outside of the standard of care, you know, I hope we\u2019d be able to see those continue. One thing that was, you know, really personally very exciting to me is we have a lot, you know, community oncology does a lot of clinical trials, something that, I think, not everyone appreciates. And we\u2019ve seen a lot of continued accrual to trials. We work very closely with one particular trial that we\u2019ve helped do data collection for, and you know, we\u2019ve seen practices, even in the last week, accrue four, five, or six patients to this. docs, despite adversity, get that clinical trials are important and are continuing to try to do it, you know, even in difficult times</p>\n<p>Hanne: It\u2019s interesting because, you know, going into this, I sort of, as an outsider, sort of naively thought that, at the broadest level, you know, the advice or the kind of thinking would be pause what we can pause safely. But it actually sounds like what you\u2019re saying is keep doing everything that we can keep doing safely, is more the spirit.</p>\n<p>Dr. Green: I mean, that\u2019s my perspective, especially\u2026I mean, it also depends on the file, right. So if you\u2019re doing a clinical trial, which are often the case in cancer, whether it\u2019s a phase 1 trial or a phase 2 trial for people with bad cancers who have run out of options, it\u2019s difficult to continue those. But I think it\u2019s appropriate, a lot of the time, to think about, \u201cHow can we make it work?\u201d</p>\n<p>Dr. Shah: We are doing an international cancer registry right now on patients with coronavirus, and this was an effort that was largely led through Twitter, actually, by recruiting other physicians from other institutions to capture all this data. And I do think that clinical trial data, especially randomized clinical trials, are going to be more difficult to do in the current era because of the regulation. there should be an importance placed on what we call real-world evidence, and this type of data would be very informative in the next several months as well as we\u2019re going to get limited data from randomized clinical trials.</p>\n<p>Hanne: Let\u2019s sort of go back to where we started and think about what happens to oncology as a whole when it\u2019s forced in this moment to go so virtual. What do you think is going to stick and what do you think we will let fall by the wayside when we finally get to move out of this moment?</p>\n<p>Dr. Shah: I do think that virtual clinics are here to stay. I also think that we\u2019re going to see a large shift away from hospital-based care and more toward home-based care. You really need your Infusion at Stanford or at your cancer center as opposed to the confines of your living room. I think, you know, if you look at certain examples, like for drugs that we\u2019re using, lymphoma, for instance, a drug called rituximab, it\u2019s an IV medication that is now being formulated to be subcutaneous, you can imagine a scenario where you had a digital safety lock on that syringe that could be activated by your provider after a virtual consultation to make sure that you\u2019re labs look okay and that you are feeling okay. And so I think a lot of the stuff that we\u2019re doing right now in the clinics can certainly be done at home kind of furthering the kind of the capabilities of virtual medicine.</p>\n<p>Hanne: What\u2019s the incentive to keep doing that after coronavirus goes truly away?</p>\n<p>Dr. Shah: Patients, in general, actually prefer this. It\u2019s amazing that after these virtual consultations, I\u2019ll often tell a patient that, \u201cWell, I\u2019ll see you back in three months, hopefully here at Stanford,\u201d and they say, \u201cWell, Doc, actually, this worked out pretty well. Why don\u2019t I see you back on the telephone, you know, on my cellphone in three months instead?\u201d And I do think that we\u2019re going to see greater use of digital health in public health and interventions as well in the horizon of public-private partnerships. You know, if you look at the countries that were the most successful in containing this epidemic, they\u2019re all countries that employ technology as a very large part of their response. You look at South Korea using cellphone data to be able to do contact tracing for patients who are infected with coronavirus. You know, even Russia was using artificial intelligence and facial recognition to be able to enforce their quarantine, not suggesting that we do that by any means, but then you can even look at China that was using artificial intelligence to be able to diagnose COVID just from chest x-rays. So I think that we\u2019re going to start seeing a lot more digital health in public health infrastructure, and I think that\u2019s another thing to secure this day as well.</p>\n<p>Dr. Green: Specifically around telemedicine, the genie is out of the bottle, and it\u2019s going to be hard to sort of put it back again. You know, one of the things that CMS did that I think was really, really helpful was expanding the number of codes that you could use for telemedicine. I like to think that\u2019s going to continue, because that just made the whole process much, much easier for clinicians to do.</p>\n<p>I like to think that all of us having to go through the experience of really asking, \u201cDo we really need these things that we always think we need,\u201d just like sort of value-based care has pushed us in the direction to second guess things that we used to do. I hope that this does as well. And then, lastly, one of the things that this whole episode has caused me to reflect on, I\u2019m fortunately healthy, my family\u2019s healthy, and I was basically\u2026we were all given news a couple of weeks ago that you have to stay at home, you can\u2019t go out, your life\u2019s going to be disrupted, and if you get this disease, there\u2019s like, for me and my age group, there\u2019s a couple percent chance that I\u2019m going to die. And that was really, really hard news for me to take as an individual, and in my job as an oncologist, I give people news 10 times worse than that, every single day.</p>\n<p>Hanne: Interesting, yeah.</p>\n<p>Dr. Green: And they deal with it a lot better than I, you know, have dealt with this. So I like to think that, for all of us who\u2019ve been lucky enough to be healthy, it gives us a little bit of perspective of what our patients go through.</p>\n<p>Hanne: That\u2019s wonderful.</p>\n<p>Dr. Agarwala: The silver lining in my view from sort of a technology perspective is that it\u2019s a pressure test of unprecedented scale for our system to navigate how to incorporate technology in different aspects of care, how to keep in touch with patients when they can\u2019t come in to the clinic, how to make complex decisions that require coordination in real time with uncertain data between different specialists. because this is a time when, under this type of real pressure, that\u2019s when these future lists are generated, and that\u2019s when we realize what we need and we realize we need now And so I think that this pressure test is just going to actually be an incredible learning opportunity for a variety of sectors of digital health.</p>\n<p>The other piece that I think is interesting, kind of zooming out of oncology, in particular, is just the increased awareness that\u2019s occurred for diagnostics and infectious disease therapeutics. I think it\u2019s given our public, our funding agencies, companies, investors, everyone across the board a deepened level of appreciation for how important anti-infective agents and preventive agents really are. And so I hope we\u2019ll see a renewed investment globally in technology and that domain.</p>\n<p>Hanne: That\u2019s really inspiring.

style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Transcript:</span></h2>\n<p><strong>Lauren Murrow</strong>: Why did you launch a newsletter?</p>\n<p><strong>Patrice Peck</strong>: I launched <a href=\"https://speakpatrice.substack.com/\">Coronavirus News for Black Folks</a> April 5th, I think. I became a journalist who covers stories about and for disenfranchised communities, but specifically black communities. And when I saw that the coronavirus was going to be disproportionately impacting people who have pre-existing medical conditions, I realized, \u201cThis is going to be overlooked. And so I was like, let me just aggregate this news, specifically as it relates to the black community.</p>\n<p><strong>Zach Haigney</strong>: I was aware of Substack and enamored with the process and the model. And then saw this emerging trend of psychedelic inspired medicine kind of coming through the clinical trials for things like PTSD, depression, anxiety. I thought it\u2019d be a really great way to monitor the news, but also think about the evergreen issues that we\u2019ll be facing in this new domain.</p>\n<p><strong>Edith Zimmerman</strong>: Yeah, part of the reason I started my newsletter was because I was doing these morning cartoons that I was turning into little stories that I was sharing on Instagram. I quit my job and started a newsletter and started sharing them on the newsletter instead. And there\u2019s something about the newsletter and the reemergence of certain kinds of blogdom\u2026personal voices in a more safe space, which sounds kind of lame, but something about that feels much better than Twitter. There\u2019s something about the framing of a newsletter when it comes to presenting work on the internet that was really appealing to me.</p>\n<p><strong>Lenny Rachitsky</strong>: I also quit my job and I was just like, \u201cWhat did I learn over these years at this company if I wanted to start my own company?\u201d So I started writing notes to myself. And then that turned into kind of the clich\u00c3\u00a9 medium posts, but the medium posts did really well. So I switched to Substack. And initially, I never had any intention to go paid. It was not even a thought in my mind that I would charge people for anything I was writing. And then actually COVID hit and I was out of a job for a year, the market collapsed, and so I was like, \u201cShit I gotta try to make some money again.\u201d And so, I tried this paid approach and it worked out.</p>\n<p><strong>Lauren</strong>: How do you decide whether to go the paid versus the unpaid route?</p>\n<p><strong>Lenny</strong>: I think there\u2019s basically two routes. Either you want to make a full-time income from the newsletter, and if that\u2019s how you want to approach it, then I think you charge. I think if you have another gig going, the newsletter is a really good way to give you new opportunities, get better jobs, learn about things. So the way I think about it is if you want it to be your main source of income, you should charge. Otherwise, you should not, because you lose in a lot of optionality and opportunity.</p>\n<p><strong>Lauren</strong>: Do you all agree?</p>\n<p><strong>Zach</strong>: Yes and no. I feel like they\u2019re both still open because I have a freemium model, where one post is free to the whole list every week and then two others go out to just the paying subscribers. So there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s continual growth of the free list and then there\u2019s more in-depth analysis that goes to paying subscribers.</p>\n<p><strong>Lauren</strong>: How has the pandemic shaped your writing? Clearly, Patrice, it was a real impetus for yours. But for the rest of you, has it shaped your process? Has it changed your content?</p>\n<p><strong>Edith</strong>: So I started it in December of 2019, and then the pandemic started. And I was trying to, hopefully, turn on the paid option right when everything was happening. And I was like, \u201cEither this is gonna be terrible for me or possibly good because people will be at home more interested in consuming the kind of stuff that I\u2019m creating.\u201d But it did seem like a real terrible mistake, like I was gambling with my whole future and security\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat am I doing?\u00e2\u0080\u009d</p>\n<p>But the stories I\u2019ve been telling haven\u2019t necessarily been about COVID; for the most part they aren\u2019t. And I think it\u2019s been an escapist place for people to read the stuff I\u2019m writing about. But it\u2019s definitely harder, because most of the most of my newsletter installments are little stories about my life and things I\u2019ve done. And for a while it was pretty limiting because I wasn\u2019t doing that much stuff.</p>\n<p><strong>Patrice</strong>: I had been toying around with the idea of doing a newsletter for probably a year or so. I had actually started a newsletter focused on myself as a writer and a black woman. At the end of March I sent it to my partner and one of my sisters and they were like, \u201cIt looks great.\u201d But something was holding me back from sending it. I was like, \u201cI don\u2019t know if this is the time to publish it.\u201d I had just resigned from BuzzFeed the past October and I really wanted to have a place where I could cultivate my own journalism audience and not depend on other publications to accept my pitches about black stories, and cultures, and communities.</p>\n<p><strong>Lauren</strong>: It seems like many of you did quit jobs to pursue this. Do you consider newsletters to be a side gig or a way to expand your audience? Or did many of you pursue this as a way to make a living?</p>\n<p><strong>Lenny</strong>: For me, I call it my \u00e2\u0080\u009cproject: avoid getting a real job.\u00e2\u0080\u009d And it started off as a side gig, as \u00e2\u0080\u009clet me just see what happens with this thing while I explore startup ideas or maybe look for other gigs.\u00e2\u0080\u009d But then it just kind of kept growing. And so at this point, it\u2019s completely my full-time income. And it takes maybe half my time. I don\u2019t have any plans beyond this.</p>\n<p><strong>Edith</strong>: I am definitely doing this in an attempt to make a full-time living. And I am not there yet. But I\u2019ve been trying to think in terms of two-year goals. So where I\u2019m at right now, I\u2019m not sustaining myself. But the trajectory would indicate that I could be there in about two years.</p>\n<p><strong>Lauren</strong>: Would anyone share what their income typically is from a month on Substack?</p>\n<p><strong>Zach</strong>: Right now it\u2019s more than groceries less than rent.</p>\n<p><strong>Lauren</strong>: That\u2019s a good barometer, I think.</p>\n<p><strong>Lenny</strong>: Mine\u2019s at about a six-figure yearly income at this point.</p>\n<p><strong>Patrice</strong>: I haven\u2019t charged readers yet\u00e2\u0080\u0094clearly, I need to talk to Lenny. What\u00e2\u0080\u0099s your subscription model?</p>\n<p><strong>Lenny</strong>: It\u2019s a weekly email. If you pay, you get it every week. And then if you don\u2019t pay, you get it once a month. And it\u2019s about 15 bucks a month, $150 a year. And I find most of my audiences is tech professionals. So a lot of them expense it to their company.</p>\n<p><strong>Patrice</strong>: That\u2019s a good market. [laughs]</p>\n<p><strong>Lauren</strong>: How do you all think about your audience? Do you have a particular demographic or a person you\u2019re writing for? Do you have someone in mind when you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re writing your newsletter?</p>\n<p><strong>Edith</strong>: I don\u2019t, which is hard. My newsletters are between 10- and 20-frame stories about something that happened to me recently. And it\u2019s a little awkward for me because like I still treat it like a journal. But sometimes I\u2019m like, \u201cOh, this is coming out kind of good. I think I\u2019m going to publish this.\u201d And then the tone shifts because I feel like I\u2019m talking to someone instead of talking to myself. And that\u2019s hard to preserve, and it\u2019s hard to think directly about. So I\u2019ll publish one story to every three that I feel came out the wrong tone or something.</p>\n<p><strong>Zach</strong>: So what\u2019s interesting in this landscape that I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m covering is that it\u2019s the convergence of a lot of different standalone fields in their own right: neuroscience, psychiatry, mental health, the healthcare system, clinical trials, FDA approval, and, obviously, psychedelics. I feel like the audience is people who are smarter than I am about all of these different things depending the topic for the day. And what that does is it forces me to reconcile with my imposter syndrome. There are a lot of readers who are literally experts on a particular domain, whether it\u2019s medicinal chemistry or drug development. So it needs to pass the sniff test for them, but also be informative for readers who are not necessarily experts in that particular domain.</p>\n<p><strong>Lauren</strong>: Some of you are creating original content, some of you are aggregating from various sources. I know \u00e2\u0080\u009ccreative process\u00e2\u0080\u009d sounds a little precious, but are there particular tools you find helpful in writing your newsletter, whether that\u2019s online or off? What\u2019s that process like?</p>\n<p><strong>Patrice</strong>: It\u2019s evolving. So I\u2019ve done aggregations. I did an original article about the history and culture of conspiracy theories in the black community. At the same time, I did an interview series called \u201cEssential and Black,\u201d because essential workers are disproportionately women and disproportionately black and brown people. I was like, \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf nobody else is going to do it, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m going to do it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d So I took money out of my own pocket, I paid some women illustrators to illustrate the essential workers who I profiled. It\u2019s been a mix and I\u2019ve been experimenting. I\u2019m trying to work to my own perfectionism as I do my newsletter.</p>\n<p><strong>Lauren</strong>: Many of you are charging for your newsletters. Does that create a pressure to produce? Do you feel like you have to keep up a particular cadence? Do you feel like you should be doing more? What feels like the right amount to have some kind of payoff for your reader?</p>\n<p><strong>Lenny</strong>: I always feel like there\u2019s this boulder chasing me for every week, for the next week. As soon as I put something out, I\u2019m like, \u201cOkay, what\u2019s coming next week?\u201d There\u2019s no better way to motivate myself to keep going and writing. What\u2019s funny with Substack is that people are buying these yearly plans. And so, in theory, I don\u2019t think you can ever stop, unless you\u2019re planning a year ahead.</p>\n<p><strong>Lauren</strong>: [laughs] The boulder\u2019s getting bigger, Lenny.</p>\n<p><strong>Lenny</strong>: Yeah, but I think it\u2019s a good thing, because it\u2019s motivation. Otherwise, I don\u2019t know if I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d keep going.</p>\n<p><strong>Zach</strong>: Every time somebody signs up for an annual subscription, you\u2019re on the hook for a year from that day. One of the things I think a lot about is how the psychedelic emerging ecosystem could go downhill, because we\u2019ve seen it in the past historically. And so I think about \u00e2\u0080\u009cHow could the paid newsletter ecosystem go downhill?\u00e2\u0080\u009d And it could be that eople get subscribers and then they make ambitious plans and we don\u2019t fulfill them. But it is a real motivator.</p>\n<p><strong>Lauren</strong>: How about you, Edith?</p>\n<p><strong>Edith</strong>: Yeah, when I switched to paid, I wasn\u2019t really anticipating that it would make much of a difference. But it\u2019s definitely a big deal because even if you\u2019re just asking people to pay a penny for it, the whole experience changes. It becomes like, \u201cOkay, this is something that if I fail to produce, I\u2019m actually failing people rather than just like following my own impulses.\u201d</p>\n<p>I do it three times a week and I\u2019ve been really struggling with what to send to people who pay for it and what to send out for free. Other people have lots of different kinds of advice about what I should do. Some people are like: \u00e2\u0080\u009cGive it all away for free.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cDon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t give any of it away for free, put it all behind the paywall.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou should sell prints rather than offering a subscription.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou should go to Patreon.\u00e2\u0080\u009d I just thought that it would be much more intuitive, but it\u2019s just lurching constantly all the time. I\u2019m trying to follow the NPR setup, basically, which is: if you\u2019re enjoying this, please consider supporting it. I really struggle with the language. I didn\u2019t think it would trip me up as much as it would, but I\u2019ve never had to directly ask people for money before.</p>\n<p><strong>Lauren</strong>: Do you all hear from your subscribers? Are they like, \u201cWe love that one\u00e2\u0080\u009d or \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe hated that one?\u00e2\u0080\u009d For those of you who have worked in media, how does it compare it to a traditional media following? Does it feel more intimate? Does it feel more niche?</p>\n<p><strong>Patrice</strong>: I don\u2019t get comments, really. I get a lot of feedback on Twitter mostly, people who are supporting the newsletter by saying, \u201cYou guys need to read this and here\u2019s why,\u201d and sharing posts. But I don\u2019t get as much interaction as I\u2019ve gotten when I\u2019ve worked at previous places. But, you know, the BuzzFeed audience is outspoken. [laughs]</p>\n<p><strong>Lauren</strong>: How about the rest of you? What kind of engagement are you seeing with your subscribers?</p>\n<p><strong>Edith</strong>: One of my favorite parts of doing this newsletter is that people write back to me over email, and it\u2019s just such pure pleasure. I\u2019ll share a story about my life and then someone will come back with a story about their life, and I just feel like I have all these ongoing conversations with people. And it\u2019s so meaningful to me. I find that people mostly say supportive things. And if they have something critical to say, they mostly keep it to themselves.</p>\n<p><strong>Lauren</strong>: That\u2019s a shift from traditional media, I would say.</p>\n<p><strong>Edith</strong>: Yeah, I guess there\u2019s something about if you\u2019ve opted into this, you can just opt-out if you don\u2019t like it.</p>\n<p><strong>Lenny</strong>: With my newsletter, it\u2019s positioned as an advice column for work, essentially. And so people are sending me questions all the time and then responding to questions I\u2019m answering. And the thing that I realized recently is that there\u2019s this really interesting community that\u2019s created. The people that subscribe to the newsletter are really interesting, and smart, and doing really cool things. And so what I ended up doing is building a Slack group for paid subscribers. If you\u2019re paid, you get into the Slack group.</p>\n<p>And that\u2019s turned into something really unexpectedly amazing, where people are asking questions, helping each other with things. There are jobs that have been found through it. I\u2019m starting to think about taking content from that community and adding it to the newsletter to give other folks a chance to surface things they\u2019ve experienced. And so that\u2019s something I definitely recommend you guys do if you have a big enough subscriber base.</p>\n<p><strong>Lauren</strong>: How do you think about growing your subscribers? Do you think about branding? How do you promote your newsletter?</p>\n<p><strong>Lenny</strong>: For me, it\u2019s essentially word of mouth, people sharing it with their co-workers and with their friends. I also use Twitter a lot. I find this really cool flywheel between Twitter and the newsletter, where I write a post and then I tweet the nuggets of the post in Twitter and give it away as much as I can. And people retweet that thing and then they follow the newsletter. So there\u2019s just kind of a back-and-forth that happens.</p>\n<p><strong>Lauren</strong>: It\u2019s a bit easier for you to say, Lenny, because you have a massive Twitter following.</p>\n<p><strong>Lenny</strong>: But it wasn\u2019t that massive initially, it started small. And I built both platforms at the same time, where I started writing and then I tweeted the same idea. And it kept growing in both directions.</p>\n<p><strong>Lauren</strong>: How do you think about it, Zach? Because, as you say, you\u2019re kind of coming into it new. How do you promote your newsletter?</p>\n<p><strong>Zach</strong>: The way I think about it is: it\u2019s B2B, so it\u2019s about the business and the policy of this emerging industry, but it\u2019s also B to what I\u2019m thinking of as, like, a fanatical C. This stuff has a lot of personal meaning for people.</p>\n<p>It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s very much chaos at this point in this space. If we can combine a curational aspect with news and then linking them together and contextualizing it, then it gets shared. And so I started with posting it to LinkedIn\u00e2\u0080\u0094 which, I\u2019ve never used my LinkedIn profile at all.</p>\n<p><strong>Lauren</strong>: Did that work?</p>\n<p><strong>Zach</strong>: It did. Yeah, I was shocked. Because there\u2019s a lot of early energy, people are looking for jobs, people are looking for investment, people are really hungry for information in this particular domain. And so even though it\u2019s a small topic in the scheme of things, when people find it seems to have been readily shared. So then I just cut off all sharing on social whatsoever, just to see if it would continue to grow, and it continued to grow. I used that as a bellwether that I was onto something in the early days.</p>\n<p><strong>Lauren</strong>: How about you, Patrice?</p>\n<p><strong>Patrice</strong>: It\u2019s interesting. Maybe the first or second week that I launched back in April, I saw that publications that target black audiences like Blavity, The Root, Black Enterprise, all covered the newsletter. I hadn\u2019t even reached out to them.</p>\n<p>It was just this one tweet that sort of got the ball rolling. Nicole Hannah Jones over at the <em>New York Times</em>, maybe mid-April, started tweeting about how the coronavirus pandemic was going to disproportionately impact black communities. And in the Twitter thread I was like, \u201cHey, actually, I started a newsletter about this in case anyone wants to check it out,\u201d and put the link. The people who are following the thread and also responding are going to see that in the Twitter thread.</p>\n<p>So, Adriana Lacy who works at the <em>Los Angeles Times</em> and who also has her own Substack newsletter called <a href=\"https://adriana.substack.com/\">The Intersection</a>\u00e2\u0080\u0094which is like musings about journalism at the intersection of tech and innovation\u00e2\u0080\u0094she saw my tweet and was like, \u201cHey, can I interview you for my newsletter?\u201d She\u2019s also a black woman, so let it be known that black women and journalists gave me the attention that really got the ball rolling with this newsletter. Nieman Lab reposted it, which got me whole bunch of other subscribers.</p>\n<p><strong>Lauren</strong>: That actually feeds in to another question I have for all of you. Does the newsletter community feel interconnected? In the way that there\u2019s an influencer community on many other social platforms that kind of feed off one another, does the same thing exist in newsletters, or does it feel more siloed?</p>\n<p><strong>Edith</strong>: It does feel connected, to me. I think when I used to read blogs, the blogs would be visibly connected to me in my mind, as a reader. But now that I\u2019m like a newsletter creator, I feel connected to other newsletter creators.</p>\n<p>And similarly, that\u2019s been my experience of growing the newsletter. I get my hugest bumps in subscriber rates after someone recommends it in their newsletter. It feels like a bunch of wheels that are layered on top of one another, Venn diagrams or something, and the spokes are often odd. The topics aren\u2019t necessarily the same, but, like, I feel more connected to someone who writes about money in a newsletter than I feel connected to a cartoonist in another form, necessarily. And it\u2019s been fun to talk about the business end of it and stuff like this podcast. We\u2019re gnawing on the same bone, but from different angles. I find that to be a really nice point of connection with people.</p>\n<p><strong>Lauren</strong>: Having all had your newsletters for roughly a year or so now\u00e2\u0080\u0094some less, some slightly more\u00e2\u0080\u0094what do you wish you\u2019d known in the beginning that you know now?</p>\n<p><strong>Lenny</strong>: I called mine \u201cLenny\u2019s Newsletter\u201d because I had no better name when I was signing up for Substack, and it\u2019s like really hard to change later. The other is going paid is a bigger deal than you think. Now you\u2019re committed to writing for a long time. And very few people see it, at least initially, only the people paying for it. I went from like thousands of people reading everything I wrote to a few hundred. And over time that builds again, but it feels really weird.</p>\n<p><strong>Lauren</strong>: How attuned are you all to how many subscribers you have?</p>\n<p><strong>Edith</strong>: Very attuned.</p>\n<p><strong>Lenny</strong>: Let\u2019s not talk about how often we check our dashboards.</p>\n<p><strong>Patrice</strong>: I\u2019m attuned also and sometimes it\u2019s like, \u201cOkay, how many followers do you have?\u201d For me, I\u2019m interested in how many people are receiving the things I\u2019m writing and creating because my intention was to empower people with information and to make a difference.</p>\n<p>At the end of the day, I think it\u2019s cool to focus on a smaller following of more loyal people rather than a massive following of people who are tepid about what you\u2019re doing. It\u2019s more impactful and influential that way.</p>\n<p><strong>Lauren</strong>: In that your newsletter is more mission-driven, do you think you will monetize? You went the Patreon route. Can you talk about why you decided to go that route, rather than others?</p>\n<p><strong>Patrice</strong>: I wrote an <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/29/opinion/coronavirus-black-people-media.html\">op-ed for the <em>New York Times</em></a> about how myself and other black journalists are exhausted because we\u2019re experiencing all these pandemics within pandemics, and they didn\u2019t just emerge overnight. That, of course, got me a huge boost in subscribers and people just reaching out, \u201cHow can I support you?\u201d This one woman was like, \u201cI just wanna send you $300, how can I do that?\u201d [laughs]</p>\n<p>But I didn\u2019t want to have that boulder, like Lenny was talking about, because I\u2019ve had that boulder my whole career working in digital media. So with my Patreon, I was like, okay, well, this is a way people can support me individually and if I skip a week on the newsletter, it will still be okay. It won\u2019t be these people paying and I\u2019m not producing anything. I do want to pivot to a subscription model because I want to provide opportunities for other black journalists, to write the stories that they see are missing about black people within the pandemic.</p>\n<p><strong>Lauren</strong>: A lot of traditional journalists are being laid off now in the midst of a pandemic. Lenny, you mentioned tech. Academia is shrinking. I think a lot of newsletter writers are coming from a lot of different industries at the moment. Do you think this is part of the evolution of media? Do you think that this kind of niche community-targeted media is the direction we\u2019re going? Or do you think that it\u2019s tangential to traditional journalism?</p>\n<p><strong>Patrice</strong>: I think it\u2019s the route that we\u2019re going. Traditional media is changing. But also, look at the way that our society has become so fractured and so siloed in terms of perspectives. It\u2019s like a snake eating its tail. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going anywhere, especially because we have these tools where anyone can become a platform.</p>\n<p><strong>Lauren</strong>: My question for all of you then is: what is the draw of a newsletter compared to either traditional media or compared to social media?</p>\n<p><strong>Zach</strong>: The architype of a writer has been something that I\u2019ve looked up to, but I never had the gumption, the courage, the orientation to go that route. So, for me, it was like, just start a Substack and then there\u2019s no gatekeeper. I reached out to a handful of publications when I first got started and never heard back from anybody. So I just started myself. From the creator\u2019s perspective, that to me feels significant. The internet allows a non-journalist to have a chance of creating something.</p>\n<p>I haven\u2019t figured out the art of Twitter. And so I want to reserve my energies for the writing and the newsletter, which I actually feel very comfortable with. I feel like that\u2019s a medium that has this unique feature of being open because it\u2019s over email. It\u2019s not on a \u201cplatform\u201d like Facebook or what have you.</p>\n<p><strong>Lauren</strong>: What\u2019s your perspective, Edith?</p>\n<p><strong>Edith</strong>: A lot of this I did because it seemed to align with the kind of stuff I wanted to create, which didn\u2019t totally exist. It\u2019s like, I wanted to have it be comics, but also writing, with ways to link into other stuff. That wasn\u2019t something I could pitch to a traditional media outlet.</p>\n<p>One problem that I think about and would be curious other people\u2019s thoughts on is: Is there a natural ceiling for this? I started following all these newsletters and I loved them, and then I became bored of them, and then now I get way too many. It really starts to add up very quickly. And I feel a sense of being one of those people. There\u2019s like an audacity of, like, \u00e2\u0080\u009cMe, my voice alone is good. Please listen to it. Don\u2019t listen to me on a team with other people, listen to me alone.\u00e2\u0080\u009d There\u2019s a lot of talk about like a fostering community, and I think a lot of newsletters have done a good job with that.</p>\n<p>That was like a big part of my favorite past job when I was running <a href=\"https://www.thehairpin.com/\">another website</a> that was a community-driven site. And so I\u2019ve moved on to this thing that\u2019s not really community-driven. It\u2019s just me creating and other people reading. I worry that the average person has an appetite for that, but will soon be exceeded by the amount of newsletters that are being created.</p>\n<p><strong>Lauren</strong>: Right. The question is, do you worry about newsletter oversaturation?</p>\n<p><strong>Edith</strong>: And specifically, the newsletters that are asking people to pay for them, like my own.</p>\n<p><strong>Lenny</strong>: Yeah, the way I think about it is: you can basically make a living off a newsletter if you have 1,000 to 3,000 paid subscribers. There\u2019s a lot of people in the world that care about a lot of different things. The way I think about it is, what are the topics that people are interested in, especially if it\u2019s professional, or something that they value enough to pay for in some way? And if you can be one of the better content producers in that vertical, I think you can make a living, and I think a lot of people can make a living doing that. I think there\u2019s so much opportunity. I personally subscribe to 65 newsletters.</p>\n<p><strong>Lauren</strong>: How many of them do you read?</p>\n<p><strong>Lenny</strong>: I read most of them. I unsubscribe for the ones I don\u2019t.</p>\n<p><strong>Lauren</strong>: As newsletter writers and readers, what are the main components behind a successful newsletter, in your opinion? The newsletters that you love, and read, and actively engage with, what makes those successful?</p>\n<p><strong>Lenny</strong>: I think there\u2019s essentially five ways to provide value. What are the different types of newsletters? Entertain the reader, make them smarter about some topic, keep them informed on what\u2019s happening, make them money, or make them feel like they\u2019re part of something bigger. If you can do one of those things really well, consistently, I think you\u2019ll have a really successful newsletter.</p>\n<p><strong>Zach</strong>: Do you optimize for one versus the other or do you feel like you\u2019re kind of mixing and matching?</p>\n<p><strong>Lenny</strong>: I\u2019ve been looking at newsletters to see if they generally fall in one of these buckets and I think generally, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just one.</p>\n<p><strong>Patrice</strong>: As someone who\u2019s always interested in hearing from marginalized and underrepresented voices, I would advocate to put your unique vantage point on top of those different buckets, whichever one you fall into. Lean into what makes you different. A lot of times, that\u2019s going to involve some transparency and being vulnerable with your subscribers, but I think that really resonates with people.</p>\n<p><strong>Lauren</strong>: One thing I\u2019m interested in is it seems to me that media is shrinking somewhat, but also becoming increasingly personality-driven. How much of your newsletters do you feel is driven by your perspective, your personality, versus information-driven? And what\u2019s the benefit of each?</p>\n<p><strong>Zach</strong>: I will say that my experience with that has been challenging. I think Naval Ravikant is credited with this quote of \u201cEscape competition through authenticity.\u201d Nobody can compete with you on being you. The early days of my newsletter were way funnier than they are now. And that that was a challenge. One, it\u2019s really tough to keep it up. But also, as the audience grows, there\u2019s a feeling of pressure. I\u2019m sort of struggling with that. I think I\u2019m coming back to that a little bit, offering more of my character, personality\u00e2\u0080\u00a6cursing to readers. But that was really challenging. It\u2019s like, \u201cOh, people are paying attention to this,\u201d and now I\u2019m shrinking in my authenticity.</p>\n<p><strong>Lauren</strong>: How do the rest do you think about how personality-driven your newsletter is?</p>\n<p><strong>Patrice</strong>: I don\u2019t have a formula for mine. It really just depends on the tone. And like Edith said, subscribers don\u2019t have to be there if they don\u2019t want to. Which is great freedom for everyone involved. So, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a right or wrong way to insert yourself.</p>\n<p><strong>Edith</strong>: Mine is definitely very personality-driven. it makes me feel close to other people in the ways that it plays out. But it\u2019s hard, it\u2019s intense and it feels very personal in a way where it\u2019s hard to just do the work and do it well. It\u2019s harder to step away from it because it feels like the camera\u2019s very, very close to my face\u00e2\u0080\u0094which is exactly where I placed it. But I wouldn\u2019t say it was necessarily the most sustainable business model.</p>\n<p><strong>Lauren</strong>: Lenny, what do you think about that?</p>\n<p><strong>Lenny</strong>: My newsletter is definitely information-driven. I try to balance \u201cOh, it\u2019s Lenny\u2019s newsletter,\u201d with \u201cOkay, it\u2019s actually just a bunch of information that you can use.\u201d But I find, similar to what Zach said, that it\u2019s really important to be authentic and honest about what you\u2019re saying and not just say things that sound good and things that other people have said. So whenever I write I try to, one, always include my perspective and my experience, but still focus it around information. And then, two, make sure I feel like this is real and honest and not just fluffy things that quickly come off as you\u2019re writing. Often when something\u2019s too easy to write, I\u2019m like, \u201cI don\u2019t know if that\u2019s actually true. Let me really think about this.\u201d</p>\n<p><strong>Lauren</strong>: How do you think about competition? Your topics are all fairly niche. Is that by design? And how do you think about others in your space?</p>\n<p><strong>Lenny</strong>: I don\u2019t spend a lot of time thinking about it. The thing I find though is most people just can\u2019t keep it up. And so even if there is somebody that\u2019s like, \u201cOh, wow, this guy is going to be even better than me,\u201d oftentimes, they have other things to do. They have jobs they gotta work on. And so, a lot of it is just consistency.</p>\n<p><strong>Lauren</strong>: Outlasting the competition.</p>\n<p><strong>Lenny</strong>: That\u2019s part of it, it\u2019s outlasting. And then the other thing is, people just don\u2019t have time to write newsletters well. And so if you actually have time and you don\u2019t have a day job that\u2019s sucking up all your brain energy and hours, you have a big advantage over a lot of other people that are thinking about it or trying to do it. Because in my experience, there\u2019s a really direct correlation between the hours I put into a newsletter and how well it does.</p>\n<p><strong>Lauren</strong>: It\u2019s tricky, you\u2019re gonna recommend a lot of people quit their jobs and start newsletters. [laughs]</p>\n<p><strong>Lenny</strong>: There\u2019s a lot of benefits to having a job. Health insurance, for example.</p>\n<p><strong>Lauren</strong>: Zach, are you a full-time newsletter writer or do you have a day job?</p>\n<p><strong>Zach</strong>: I\u2019m an acupuncturist and we recently moved from Brooklyn to Portland, Maine about a year ago. So I was in the process of getting a new practice up and running in March of this past year, and then I had to shut it down. But I very much intend to be doing this full-time as soon as I can. And I think I could probably get to that point in the next year and a half to two years.</p>\n<p><strong>Lauren</strong>: Patrice, how do you strike that balance, in that this is not your full-time gig? How do you strike the balance between making a living and this newsletter, which started out as kind of a passion project?</p>\n<p><strong>Patrice</strong>: I freelance, but that\u2019s more writing. And from someone who\u2019s burnt out from writing, it\u2019s <em>a lot</em>. So, yeah. I\u2019m figuring it all out as I go.</p>\n<p><strong>Lauren</strong>: How would you define success when it comes to your newsletter? So, what\u2019s the point you\u2019re aiming for when you\u2019ll be like, \u201cI\u2019ve made it. It\u2019s a successful newsletter.\u201d Or if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve reached that point, how long did it take?</p>\n<p><strong>Lenny</strong>: I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll say, for me, there\u2019s the financial goal and then there\u2019s the emotional goal. I\u2019d say financially, it\u2019s when I can get past the salary that I had in my last job. Then I would feel like, \u201cHoly shit, this is crazy, and real, and I could stick with this for a while.\u201d</p>\n<p><strong>Lauren</strong>: Have you done that?</p>\n<p><strong>Lenny</strong>: I haven\u2019t done it yet. And then emotionally, I think it\u2019s just consistently feeling people are getting value from it by emails I get, and replies, and tweets, and things like that. As long as it continues, I feel like I\u2019m on the right track.</p>\n<p><strong>Edith</strong>: Yeah, I really like that answer. That that speaks to my experience too, which is that it was emotionally fulfilling pretty much right off the bat. And financially, my goal is to get 1,000 paying subscribers in one year and 2,000 by the end of the second year. I\u2019m like halfway to the first, so just shy of 500 paying subscribers. But I kind of like the previous salary thing. That\u2019s a nice benchmark.</p>\n<p><strong>Zach</strong>: <a href=\"https://a16z.com/2020/02/06/100-true-fans/\">1,000 True Fans</a> is like a mantra for me, trying to get to that point. I think that\u2019s a real proof of concept.</p>\n<p><strong>Lauren</strong>: How close are you to reaching that benchmark?</p>\n<p><strong>Zach</strong>: Not close. But I think I can do it in 12 to 18 months. But then there\u2019s also this idea of optionality. I set out with the intent to create an opportunity for myself in this emerging space. And the at-bats that I have on that front, that are creating something analogous, that would allow me to keep writing, but also provide some sort of steady income, that seems to be getting closer. And they\u2019re getting more substantive. So those are the two frameworks that I\u2019m using.</p>\n<p><strong>Lauren</strong>: Patrice, do you have a perspective on that?</p>\n<p><strong>Patrice</strong>: Ideally, you know, it\u2019s so successful that there\u2019s no longer a need for it because there\u2019s no disproportionate impact. And hopefully my newsletter contributes to that in some way. Hopefully, it allows someone to avoid getting infected or to better care for people in their community once they\u2019re diagnosed with it.</p>\n<p><strong>Lauren</strong>: In our last couple minutes, I\u2019d like to do a lightning round. What are some of your favorite newsletters?</p>\n<p><strong>Patrice</strong>: I really like Darian Symon\u00c3\u00a9 Harvin\u2019s <a href=\"https://darian.substack.com/\">Beauty IRL</a>. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a deep dive into beauty, the same way people do deep dives into politics and other hard news. <a href=\"https://zebablay.substack.com/\">Carefree Black Girl</a> by Zeba Blay. <a href=\"https://haleynahman.substack.com/\">Maybe Baby</a>, it\u2019s this writer she was at Man Repeller and she left and she started her own newsletter. It\u2019s just musings on what\u2019s happening in her life. The common thread is millennial women being transparent about the way culture and society are impacting their life and perspective.</p>\n<p><strong>Lauren</strong>: Zach?</p>\n<p><strong>Zach</strong>: <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/\">Stratechery</a> by Ben Thompson is one. Bill Bishop, who\u2019s like the OG Substack writer writes a <a href=\"https://sinocism.com/\">China newsletter</a> that\u2019s been motivational for me. There\u2019s another guy, Jacob Donnelly, who writes a newsletter called <a href=\"https://www.amediaoperator.com/\">A Media Operator</a>. It\u2019s about operating a media company, but he\u2019s a one-person operation himself. So it focuses a lot on the solo creator. <a href=\"https://pomp.substack.com/\">Anthony Pompliano</a> has got a good one. <a href=\"https://andrewsullivan.substack.com/\">Andrew Sullivan</a> just switched over to Substack, so that\u2019s a full circle there.</p>\n<p><strong>Lauren</strong>: Edith?</p>\n<p><strong>Edith</strong>: I really like <a href=\"https://thebrowser.com/\">The Browser</a>, which is a selection of stories from around the internet every day and they\u2019re always from really weird corners. There\u2019s a British writer, Ian Leslie, he has a personal newsletter. He recently switched to Substack. It\u2019s called <a href=\"https://ianleslie.substack.com/\">The Ruffian</a>, it\u2019s selections of his own work, but then also stories he finds online, and I really like his tone. I like <a href=\"https://craigmod.com/ridgeline/\">Craig Mod</a>\u2018s newsletter. He\u2019s in Japan. He\u2019s a photographer and it\u2019s sort of like personal musings. There\u2019s an antique jewelry newsletter that I love. My friend Monica McLaughlin runs it and it\u2019s called <a href=\"https://dearest.substack.com/\">Dearest</a>. It\u2019s also on Substack. And then a daily newsletter I really like that I\u2019ve contributed to in the past is called <a href=\"https://whyisthisinteresting.substack.com/\">Why Is This Interesting?</a> And it\u2019s just different stuff every morning.</p>\n<p><strong>Lauren</strong>: Lenny?</p>\n<p><strong>Lenny</strong>: <a href=\"https://2pml.com/\">2PM</a> by Webb Smith talks about DTC ecommerce, a really good newsletter. <a href=\"https://li.substack.com/\">Li Jin</a> has an awesome newsletter about the Passion Economy, and now she has like a video series every week where they interview someone in the Passion Economy. <a href=\"https://danco.substack.com/\">Alex Danko</a> has an awesome newsletter about tech and trends and things like that. <a href=\"https://turner.substack.com/\">Turner Novak</a>, who\u2019s a VC, he has a great newsletter which goes deep on various companies like TikTok and Pinduoduo. Nikhil he has this great newsletter called <a href=\"https://nbt.substack.com/\">Next Big Thing</a>. Alex Kantrowitz left BuzzFeed and started a newsletter called <a href=\"https://bigtechnology.substack.com/\">Big Technology</a>, where he writes about tech. Polina has an awesome newsletter called <a href=\"https://theprofile.substack.com/\">The Profile</a> where she profiles successful people. There\u2019s also The <a href=\"https://everything.substack.com/\">Everything</a>, which has a lot of great content. And there\u2019s also one called <a href=\"https://notboring.substack.com/\">Not Boring</a> that\u2019s not boring and great that I recommend.</p>\n<p><strong>Lauren</strong>: Great title.

I\u2019m Sonal, and today we\u2019re sharing more founder stories; this one hosted by Ben Horowitz and starting with one of our very own partners, Lars Dalgaard. We cover Lars\u2019s own story founding SuccessFactors, one of the earlier software as a service companies. It was founded in 2001 which IPOed in 2008 and was acquired by SAP in 2012.</p>\n<p>The company focused on software for human capital management in the enterprise. And on that note, in this episode, we cover Lars\u2019s views on what are the success factors in talent, scaling companies, and most importantly scaling culture. Over to Ben and Lars.</p>\n<p>Ben: Hello, this is Ben Horowitz, and I\u2019m here with Lars Dalgaard. And we are going to talk today about how he built SuccessFactors and achieved the first great outcome in software as a service and then what he took away from that. Welcome, Lars.</p>\n<p>Lars: Thank you, Ben. I\u2019m excited to have this discussion.</p>\n<p>Ben: Well, let\u2019s start with SuccessFactors. So you came here from Denmark. How did you and SuccessFactors first get started, and were people all fired up about it? Did they believe in you? How did you get it going?</p>\n<p>Lars: Yeah, it seemed like pretty much no one believed in it. We had the opportunity, or I personally did, to pitch through 73 venture capitalists who all said no. That was painful because in some cases, I brought it in front of customers and also good stuff\u2026</p>\n<p>Ben: Freaking venture capitalists.</p>\n<p>Lars: Yeah, I know.</p>\n<p>Ben: I hate those guys.</p>\n<p>Lars: Who the hell wants to be around them? It hurt my feelings. It was hard and oddly, it didn\u2019t really influenced me much because I kind of felt that this had to be done. And to me, that is the number one piece of information for anybody starting a company; don\u2019t try and catch a wave. Don\u2019t try and do something you\u2019ve read in a magazine that might be hot and you can just get in on it because there is no such thing. Once you try to catch that wave, that wave is gone, and it\u2019s got a bunch of people on it that came up with it, and they are well-funded and it\u2019s over.</p>\n<p>Ben: So you\u2019re saying, don\u2019t do it if you want to do it or if you think it\u2019s a good idea; only do it if you have no choice?</p>\n<p>Lars: I think so, it must be done.</p>\n<p>Ben: It must be done.</p>\n<p>Lars: I remember asking Reed Hastings a long, long time ago over a decade ago\u2026 started Netflix\u2026 get done, Pure Software, a bunch of other companies I was impressed with. And at that time the story was because I got tired of walking the extra blocks to the blockbuster store with my VHS tape. Why couldn\u2019t I just use DVDs? So I think it\u2019s\u2026</p>\n<p>Ben: You had to do it for a walk.</p>\n<p>Lars: \u2026to assume that he didn\u2019t imagine a $50 billion streaming empire. It had to be done. For him it was too damn stupid. And every amazing entrepreneur I meet, when they start talking, they get so steely-eyed when they talk about the reason that they\u2019re doing this and why it must be done. It literally means that nobody will ever extinguish that fire. It will just keep burning.</p>\n<p>Ben: Yeah, so did that\u2026what did that mean? Did that mean that SuccessFactors was straightforward to build because it had to be done or was it challenging or how did you go from no from 73 VCs to $3.5 billion outcome?</p>\n<p>Lars: Well, first of all, it was an exceptional effort of a lot of people that all of a sudden began finding a place that was as important to them as their family and their friends, and it was a big part of their lives and they gave it everything they had. They left nothing on the field. I have over 10,000 examples of what they did to get us there, and I\u2019m grateful to all of them.</p>\n<p>It was extremely hard. In fact, I just spoke to my co-founder this morning, and we joked about it never got any easier. We looked at each other like, \u201cWhen did it got easy?\u201d And people ask us this thing. When did you get into a glide path and on the stride? It was like, \u201cI don\u2019t remember when I was checking in with him. Do you remember?\u201d No, it never got easier. So it was always hard. It was different degrees of hard. Sometimes it was just physically hard challenge. Sometimes your brain turned upside down and you were wondering what the hell you were doing. There are many different hards.</p>\n<p>Ben: And so why did you continue? If it was hard the whole way, and every step of the way was a grind, what was the thing that kind of kept you going? Every quarter is hard, every sale is hard, every product cycle is hard, every employee quitting is hard.</p>\n<p>Lars: Well, it starts back with it had to be done. I believed in the overvalue of creating a much, much more richer, better informed dialogue in the workplace across the globe, whether it\u2019s a non-profit or it\u2019s the NFL or it\u2019s Walmart. I believe that better dialogue create greater, big lives for every individual who goes to work every day and in the process, the whole company could be lifted up because they could do better work and then create better products.</p>\n<p>And so I had to see that come into fruition, and at 50 million people using it, I began to believe that it was going to be a consistent and systemic change that would not go away. So that was exciting for me. The second thing is something begins to happen when you\u2019re together with people, and it\u2019s like a sports team. You just have to do it together and you\u2019re excited and you look forward to coming back and doing that thing, you\u2019re all together.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s not like you show up at 8:00 in the morning; you\u2019re always doing it. And so I had to find a part that I could accept that I was always working because I always was working and so were the people I was teaming up with. And so it became a thing that we were involved with. That was part of our systems, part of our body.</p>\n<p>Ben: So really, interestingly, the company that you built, SuccessFactors, helped other companies with their success factors. Basically, the whole point of the company was to basically help people build better companies.</p>\n<p>Lars: Yes.</p>\n<p>Ben: And so as you looked at how you did that within your company for your customers and then now as you\u2019re trying to help entrepreneurs do it, what are the things that get people to do what you said? What are the things that get someone to build a company where people are doing it for each other? They\u2019re not doing it for like a billion dollars. They\u2019re not doing it to sell their stock in series B. They\u2019re not doing it to be in TechCrunch or on a headline but they\u2019re actually doing it for each other and that\u2019s something larger than themselves, how do you build a culture like that?</p>\n<p>Lars: So I think it starts with values. Many times when I say that people will say, \u201cOh, I saw those at another company I worked at. Nobody knew them, nobody remembered them, and it didn\u2019t mean anything.\u201d Well, then don\u2019t make those values. Make some values that people remember.</p>\n<p>Ben: I thought that was an HR offsite like exercise, what are you talking about?</p>\n<p>Lars: Exactly. Why not make some values that you can remember, that you\u2019re proud to espouse that you want to tell everyone about? Your family, your friends, that when you look at those values, they mean something to you. And those are the type of values we had. My first one was respect for the individual that starts and it said, no assholes. I just believed that with every part of my fiber, and I believe that if you set that tone to everyone, then there is no discussion of whether that\u2019s how we\u2019re going to work together or not.</p>\n<p>Ben: What\u2019s an asshole?</p>\n<p>Lars: First of all, everybody has one, and I think everybody is not confused.</p>\n<p>Ben: I thought that was an opinion.</p>\n<p>Lars: No. It\u2019s okay to have one; it\u2019s just not okay to be one is what we used to say. The reality is everybody knows what are those. It\u2019s somebody who is abusive. It\u2019s somebody who doesn\u2019t think before they speak. It\u2019s somebody who\u2019s not accountable for the shit they throw out there. It\u2019s somebody who\u2019s politically trying to get somewhere without actually being part of a team that does somewhere. It\u2019s someone who needs to put themselves forward at the cost of everyone else. It\u2019s someone who\u2019s rude. It\u2019s someone who takes advantage of a situation that they full well know they shouldn\u2019t be. I could keep going and going and going and going.</p>\n<p>Ben: But those are all things that are really interesting but they\u2019re generally things that people feel about other people but rarely feel about themselves. So how do you go about with a value like that building like real self-awareness and what are the object lessons that occurred in your company to change that behavior? Because you\u2019re really not here talking about getting rid of a behavior rather than a person in a lot of ways when you say no assholes.</p>\n<p>Lars: Yeah. The way it ended up working for us was it became very self-selecting because people thought that they could still join because we happen to be the fastest-growing company for many years in Silicon Valley. So in that part, people were like, \u201cI\u2019ll join this because they\u2019re growing fast and they won\u2019t discover who I am, and I can get away with my asshole ways.\u201d But the second they came into an organization where you\u2019re actually allowed to speak up if someone is, everybody becomes a police officer that governs this incredibly important value. And so many people self-select out after a couple of weeks and just say, \u201cShit. This is not for me, man. I\u2019m not there yet in my life.\u201d I like to believe everybody can\u2019t become not an asshole, but it\u2019s just you need to have that much introspectively.</p>\n<p>Ben: You have to want to be not an asshole.</p>\n<p>Lars: Yeah, you have to want to. Yeah, and some people have had so much hurt and pain, and they have so little commitment to changing themselves that they\u2019re not going to go there. But I\u2019ll give you a very specific example of how we put this into practice which has a lot of allure just because it\u2019s kind of funny, but it actually wasn\u2019t funny to me when I came up with it and became legend for our company which was, it was very normal for people to email the CEO and say, \u201cHey, I don\u2019t like what Joan was doing and you need to know as a CEO because it\u2019s really bad for the company, and it\u2019s the opposite of what you want.\u201d So if you kind of focus\u2026</p>\n<p>Ben: Kind of a little bit of manipulation going on there. It\u2019s like, all right, I\u2019m going to kiss the boss\u2019s ass and take out my peer at the same time. This is going to be awesome.</p>\n<p>Lars: It\u2019s a double, these two samurai swords. Of course, the shock then is when you send that email back and you copy Joan on it, who this person was speaking about and you don\u2019t make either Joan or this person feel bad but you say\u2026</p>\n<p>Ben: How does Joan not feel bad?</p>\n<p>Lars: Well, she\u2019s probably surprised when she sees it, but what happens to her when she sees that she\u2019s being respected because she knew she wanted to know what the other person wrote. And when she knows and she knows she\u2019s supported by the CEO and the management that that sort of shit won\u2019t happen, her whole life changes.</p>\n<p>She gets a commitment to that organization because she now knows that she feels a level of safety and trust that in this company, that won\u2019t happen again. And it\u2019s almost as if when they come into an organization they\u2019re thinking, \u201cThere\u2019s so much of that but I\u2019m willing to do it. I get paid. It\u2019s a good job. It\u2019s better than the other one and this works for me. But I\u2019m going to tolerate that 20% to 30% of bullshit that\u2019s just inhuman that I don\u2019t want to be around, but fuck it, it\u2019s how companies are.\u201d</p>\n<p>But when you all of a sudden see that being completely x-rayed and it\u2019s right out there and you say in a very supportive way, \u201cHey, you wrote me this about Joan. I\u2019m sure Joan would like to know and I think you guys need to go figure this out.\u201d So first of all, in our office, we all sat out in the open. Nobody had a big fancy office. We\u2019re all sitting in the same desk, and what you can begin to realize around the office is people seeing the electricity that happens and then they meet and you see them talk about it, and something magical happens. Because I think deep down everyone wants to have that conversation and that person who wrote it actually want to tell Joan. They just aren\u2019t equipped to do it, and they\u2019ve gotten scared of doing it. What happens now is now it\u2019s endorsed and it\u2019s, \u201cWe need to have this conversation otherwise this company can\u2019t move on any further.\u201d And that\u2019s what the power is of that type of exchange.</p>\n<p>And when it begins to happen throughout the\u2026and guarantee you never get an email from that person again, and you actually begin to see the two of those people work together. I\u2019d say 9 out of 10 cases, they become people who trust each other and start working together. People can forgive.</p>\n<p>Ben: Well, let\u2019s get to the 1 out of the 10 cases. A lot of CEOs in Silicon Valley would say, \u201cLook, we\u2019re in a war for talent.\u201d If that person, the so-called that person is, whatever, 10x or top-end engineer who are often the kind of people who will send you an email like that, and I stripped them naked like you\u2019re talking about, emotionally naked, they might quit. And so like I can\u2019t afford to lose my 10x\u00e2\u0080\u00a6or how would you react to that kind of thinking?</p>\n<p>Lars: Oh, I\u2019m completely comfortable losing the 10x. What the total unanimous team that are together in fighting this big battle can gain together because they have that power of trust, completely dwarfs that one 10x. You multiply all those people up, what they were doing like that and let them perform together, there\u2019s no 10x and no single 10x that can even think about competing with that type of power. And I\u2019ve seen that scale. Nobody can stop you.</p>\n<p>I believe strongly it\u2019s what Southwest Airlines did. They came and turned to, everybody said, \u201cIt\u2019s monopoly. You can\u2019t do anything in this. What are you thinking?\u201d And 20 years later, their market cap was that of all the others combined. You can.</p>\n<p>Ben: Let\u2019s talk about scale for a moment. So SuccessFactors was the biggest thing and most important thing that you ever ran, so how did you learn to run the biggest thing that you ever ran? How did you go about that?</p>\n<p>Lars: So how do you learn things you don\u2019t know, and how do you learn that the speed you\u2019ll need to not lose market share and not get killed by a competitor? You think you have to adopt a perpetually learning mindset. In particular, my hardest part was I like to be right and I didn\u2019t really like to admit that I was ever wrong, and I really didn\u2019t want to personally ask anyone anything.</p>\n<p>In fact, you can\u2019t find any of my friends working for my company for the first decade, and you couldn\u2019t find any of our customers being any of my friends, and many of my friends run big companies. So that\u2019s a bit stupid you\u2019d think. For me it wasn\u2019t because I thought it was complete waste of time signing them up. It would be like a keiretsu or a pyramid scheme. Of course they would sign up, but that\u2019s not what I\u2019m here to build. I\u2019m here to build a gigantic business that could really, with zero friction, grow to massive scale and be amazing to everyone involved and be very profitable.</p>\n<p>And so if I\u2019m just signing up all of my buddies, that doesn\u2019t tell me anything, and it informs me nothing. So it\u2019s a waste of time. I can always sign them up. So what I wanted to do was find out how do I get customers that really believe in what we\u2019re dealing with.</p>\n<p>And so therefore, my biggest principle came not lying to yourself, and what that meant was reams of data because it doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m a complete math freak. It just means data doesn\u2019t lie as much as your own brain does, and you can come up with all sorts of interpretations around why what you\u2019re thinking is actually right but there is nothing to prove it. Also it had massive instincts and more ideas than a Quaker has oats, so I\u2019d always throw new things out there.</p>\n<p>But I have data underneath it, I would make sure that it was actually somewhat realistic that it was going to go there. So what I wouldn\u2019t track was the 12th and the 13th month only. I would track every quarter and every month was always very easily accessible not, \u201cHey, can you guys go get it? It was right there in front of us.\u201d And that did not tell as many lies as my brain did. I would think that market was actually doing well and the data just wasn\u2019t there, and then we had an organization where people are allowed to say, but it\u2019s not there.</p>\n<p>You\u2019d like it to be there but it\u2019s not there. It\u2019s just not there. And so that type of truth in what you\u2019re actually doing and then also allowing other people to believe that they could tell the truth and not get blamed by, \u201cHey, you\u2019re speaking against this person and therefore you shouldn\u2019t be allowed to talk.\u201d Like having a culture where that\u2019s allowed; it\u2019s permitted to speak your truth.</p>\n<p>Ben: Well, getting back to the war for talent because I think this is where I see a lot of entrepreneurs who would not do what you\u2019re talking about, they like to always paint the rosiest few of their company particularly to their employees, the last people they want to say, \u201cLook, the data says we\u2019re fucked,\u201d or \u201cThe data says we failed,\u201d or \u201cThe data said we missed,\u201d because they want to go, \u201cOh no, it\u2019s going great.\u201d Like when I told you we were going to be the biggest company ever when I recruited you and you were going to make $100 million, that\u2019s still true. And so how do you think about that and how do you reconcile having an honest culture that doesn\u2019t lie to itself versus keeping people who are very focused on their fiduciary responsibility to their family staying in the company?</p>\n<p>Lars: So nobody in my company sold before we went public. Secondly, my co-founder and I agreed that if somebody would ever say, \u201cSo when are you going public?\u201d They could not get a job. And that\u2019s pretty extreme but it tells you our culture. We weren\u2019t there to go public and despite how many people have said this and it\u2019s just a financing event. So going public cannot be a goal in itself. And if that\u2019s what you\u2019ve put in everyone\u2019s head, then you\u2019re constantly fighting that until you\u2019re public, and that\u2019s not where you want to be.</p>\n<p>You want to take everyone\u2019s energy and put it into building something of value that they can relate to. And that\u2019s how you bring it back to, \u201cWell, so this quarter wasn\u2019t great. Let\u2019s talk about why we don\u2019t think it was great, and what went wrong, and what your role is in fixing it.\u201d The amazing thing is I was so afraid of admitting this for 10-20 years is people actually want to be led. If you give them very clear leadership around what their role is in taking us to the promised land, that\u2019s not some big number.</p>\n<p>Another thing was I got a very big resume person in who would in the leadership she almost said, \u201cWe\u2019re almost 1000 employees now. Let\u2019s tell everyone.\u201d How is that a goal to achieve 1000 employees? It doesn\u2019t mean anything. It\u2019s a lot of cost. It doesn\u2019t mean a thing. And so why bring that out there? Or now we\u2019re valued at a billion or 2 billion. Why tell anyone that? It\u2019s just not important. What\u2019s important is\u2026</p>\n<p>Ben: A hundred million registered users.</p>\n<p>Lars: Yeah.</p>\n<p>Ben: They\u2019re not users. They\u2019re just registered.</p>\n<p>Lars: They\u2019re just registered. Yeah, exactly. So what matters is, let me have this customer come up on stage and talk about how their life has actually been changed because of the work you\u2019ve done, or let me pick an engineer that did something that everyone thought was outstanding. Another thing we would do is we would pick MVPs which was very, very, very unpopular but I do this way to the algorithm where even somebody who didn\u2019t have as many people in their organization would get a fair value based on the votes that they were collecting.</p>\n<p>And having this absolute score, we both did that as well as the way to the algorithm ended up the same way. And so we\u2019d have people actually being cherished in the company for the contribution that they have had and the number thing was how they contribute to everyone else\u2019s productivity. And that just became legend for that company. We had these batons like when you\u2019re running the 4\u00d7100 that we would hand out to everyone showing that what we don\u2019t care about is you throwing\u00e2\u0080\u00a6another word I learned when I came to Silicon Valley was throwing something over the wall.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s like the most asinine toxic thing I\u2019ve ever heard in my life and people would say it with a big smile on their face. I just threw it all over the wall to the product management, and walked off. Who the hell wants to receive anything that was thrown over the wall? You want to have something that is\u2026like if you\u2019ve seen Carl Lewis practice the handover of that baton, there was nothing they hadn\u2019t thought about. They didn\u2019t shatter those world records by accident. They were the first\u2026</p>\n<p>Ben: Carl Lewis was that famous track star in the \u201980s, for those of you who are young.</p>\n<p>Lars: He was legendary, yeah. But what they would do is they would show you how to nail that handover. It was timed perfectly and every little millimeter of handover was figured out. And that\u2019s how I always thought at the back of my mind of building an organization. Drucker, sort of OG of management, would talk about the real power of an organization is not in the silos. It\u2019s when you can leverage across the organization, product management to marketing, sales to engineering. When you can have a fluid communication flow there that is honest, you can do insane thing with the company. You can be unstoppable.</p>\n<p>Ben: Moving onto board of directors, is the board of directors really important for a young company? Isn\u2019t that just like a bureaucratic waste of time, I mean having a bunch of guys who sit on your board and you\u2019ve got to go present to them every quarter? Aren\u2019t you better off just running fast?</p>\n<p>Lars: Breathing down your throat.</p>\n<p>Ben: Yeah, breathing down your throat, asking you a bunch of questions that you don\u2019t want to answer.</p>\n<p>Lars: Yeah. Well, I think there\u2019s at least three things. First of all, a board member will\u00e2\u0080\u00a6the combined board will never know more than you can balance on a pin hat of the company and they shouldn\u2019t. That\u2019s for the CEO to know; CEO runs the company. But what I learned the hard way, I would say, as I expanded my board is that these people are people who care about your company, and they actually understand company building. And if you\u2019ve hired good people to the same degree that you\u2019ve built the great company, then they will give you advice that is immeasurable and is important to you.</p>\n<p>Many times you can\u2019t see it at first back to that learning mindset, you just can\u2019t believe it even, and particularly because you\u2019re probably not that challenged in your daily job because everybody adores you as the founding CEO that\u2019s so amazing, that\u2019s a rock star. But here are some people that couldn\u2019t give less of a shit. They have your best interest in heart and they\u2019re going to tell you some things that you need to hear.</p>\n<p>So you can either find those things out because it\u2019s the immutable laws of physics. You will find these things out by running your head straight into the wall without a helmet and that\u2019s going to hurt a lot. You might not even recover from the brain trauma or you can try and listen to some of the stuff that you\u2019ve actually learned. They\u2019re not sitting there because there\u2019s money in it, it\u2019s because they want to help.</p>\n<p>And then the final thing is I think you will be surprised, I certainly was, of how important some of the things that I had first just rejected almost in reactivity like the\u2026</p>\n<p>Ben: Like what kinds of things did you reject?</p>\n<p>Lars: Well, my reptilian brain would shoot in because for me mostly because I was probably afraid of what they were telling me.</p>\n<p>Ben: Tell you to do something you don\u2019t know how to do.</p>\n<p>Lars: Yeah, I had no experience in it. It\u2019s scary, and don\u2019t you know how good I am? Look at me. I\u2019m growing faster than everyone else. Do you not understand how great I am? Look at my people what we all did; it was insane what we did. Have you ever grown a company this fast? Which most of them hadn\u2019t, but that\u2019s irrelevant. They had grown companies fast at their time.</p>\n<p>And so the relevance is that you become all victim-y and ego based when they start telling you that you need to think different but the reality is they\u2019re giving you really important insights for where you need to take your company. And in most of the cases where there was turnaround people, geographical trouble, pricing issues, where you need to\u2026one big one that I thought I had figured out forever was when we have to do a big layoff in Q3 of 2008 when the whole world was melting. I thought I was all clever because I was out with customers and I went to a Boston office and one of my board members said, \u201cNo, you need to be in the head office.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ben: Yeah.</p>\n<p>Lars: It hurts mostly because I thought I was the cultural leader that got that more than she did but she was right and I was wrong, and I needed to get my ass on a plane back to the head office and face the music. And I am so happy I did that. I ended up walking out to people\u2019s cars with their boxes hugging them and I tell you, that made me put in the position where I could rehire them later when we were doing well again. But if I had been in that Boston office, it would\u2019ve been the biggest mistake I made.</p>\n<p>Ben: So you touched on something very interesting there which is your strength which was determination, confidence, will to power ended up being your issue which is all that led you to not want to take any advice even advice that would be very, very valuable to you. How did you learn how to listen and then how do you see that on entrepreneurs today where their great strength can end up undermining all of their efforts?</p>\n<p>Lars: So I learned that I think by running my head into the wall and getting some big cuts in my forehead and a\u2026</p>\n<p>Ben: Head concussion.</p>\n<p>Lars: Concussion.</p>\n<p>Ben: CEO CTE.</p>\n<p>Lars: Yeah, and so I think you can even manage to ignore that because there\u2019s so many other great things because you\u2019re living in the best time ever and you have to acknowledge supporting you to get such turbo propellers into an opportunity that you really can\u2019t get in old industries. And so it\u2019s very hard if you compare to what the alternatives are to believe that you are actually not doing as well as you can.</p>\n<p>But once you begin to see that there are some decay and there are some issues when the company starts scaling, then it becomes very natural to realize you need help. Another important thing I did was I got a coach. And what\u2019s really great about a coach is that they\u2019re actually a safer place in a way than a board is. And it\u2019s not like we all have an adviser, that\u2019s not the same. An adviser will cancel a meeting with you if they have something else to do. They won\u2019t be consistent even if they\u2019re your friend.</p>\n<p>This is not your friend, and you don\u2019t need friends here. You need friends for other things. You need somebody who has got business experience and who can actually talk truth to you around how they can start out with the 360, where you\u2019re getting real input anonymously from the whole organization including the board. But once you begin to realize the power of asking for help which was really a hard place for me to get, you realize that now you are building a muscle structure you never even knew was possible. You\u2019re running faster. You\u2019re hitting the ball faster, hit longer. You\u2019re doing something you never even know you\u2019re able to do.</p>\n<p>And so, like inviting that crowd sourced power of knowledge around people that care about your company, it\u2019s the only way to get there. I actually don\u2019t think you can get there all the way, and certainly not the potential that you would be able to if you don\u2019t tap into all of these people. And I think, most people that have real success now, you ask them, they always have a bunch of people that they ask a lot of great questions.</p>\n<p>Ben: All right. Well, I\u2019d like to thank Lars for joining me. And as you heard from him, and as Michael Jackson said, you are not alone.</p>\n<p>Lars: You are not alone\u2026</p>\n<p>Ben: And this has been the a16z Podcast.

Our first game was a mobile title, then we did another PC title before Spellbreak. We\u2019re mostly located in Boston, although right now everyone is remote. We\u2019ve raised about 30 million in total venture capital over a couple of rounds of funding. We have about 85 people on the team currently, but we\u2019re growing to around 150 to support Spellbreak for the rest of this year.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">For anyone who hasn\u2019t seen it, Spellbreak is an action spellcasting Battle Royale. It\u2019s going to be free to play. We started developing it back in Q4 of 2016, which feels like forever ago, but we are launching the cross-platform version later this year [ed: <a href=\"https://playspellbreak.com/en\">September 3, 2020</a>]. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to be releasing it on Xbox One, Switch PS4, and the Epic Game Store with full cross-play and full cross-progression.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">But this presentation is focused on the pre-alpha that we ran over the summer of 2018, and how we gained traction for the PC alpha launch in February 2019.</span></p>\n<span class=\"bctt-click-to-tweet\"><span class=\"bctt-ctt-text\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https://a16z.com/2020/09/02/spellbreak-lessons/&amp;text=If%20there%27s%20one%20thing%20you%20take%20away%20from%20this%20talk%2C%20it%20should%20be%20this%3A%20No%20one%20cares%20about%20your%20game.%20I%20cannot%20recommend%20enough%20how%20humble%20you%20should%20be%20about%20this...It%27s%20your%20job%20to%20make%20people%20care.&amp;via=sjsivak&amp;related=sjsivak\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">If there's one thing you take away from this talk, it should be this: No one cares about your game.

There are so many games coming out, and there\u2019s so much noise all time, and you\u2019re competing with everyone. You\u2019re competing with Netflix, you\u2019re competing with Facebook and TikTok. No one cares about your game. It\u2019s your job to make people care.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">And it\u2019s not too early. If you think it\u2019s too early to start, I can tell you that we made the decision to go out in a pre-alpha because we were not really getting anywhere with potential partners and publishers. We knew we had to show traction, and it was way before any of us were comfortable having players in the game. I look back at some of those videos now of what the gameplay actually looked like at that time, and it was very early in terms of its course of development. But I think it\u2019s really important to find a way to make players care about your game.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Before I jump into all of the lessons learned, a quick disclaimer: Every game is different. Every market is different. Every team is different. I\u2019m going to give you a bunch of advice here, so I think it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s important to take all of it with a grain of salt. On top of that, I think we made a bunch of really smart decisions, but we also got really lucky. I think it\u2019s important to acknowledge that. And the really unsatisfying thing is that the best way to make players care about your game is to make a game that players care about. And that\u2019s incredibly difficult.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<h3 id=\"high-upside-channels\"><span style=\"color: #ff6600\"><strong><b>1. Focus on high upside channels</b></strong></span><b></b></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">To give you a sense of where we started, what we wanted to do was capture interest from excited fans, get their email addresses for them to sign up for our pre-alpha, and then get them engaged with the game. The number one thing I think everyone should be doing right now is focusing on their high upside channels. That\u2019s not things like Twitter or Facebook because, at the time, our Twitter had very few followers, a couple hundred. That\u2019s not how you go viral. So what we did instead is we took our development blog and we put it on Imgur. By doing that, we were able to generate 200,000 views, and that would drive tens of thousands of email signups for our email list. And no one had even heard of the game; we hadn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even announced the name for the game yet.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">A big reason why I think we were able to grow is channels like Imgur, like 9gag, like Reddit, where you can actually still go viral without needing a base to build from. There\u2019s a lot of these out here, and they change all the time, but focus on areas where you can still get on a top viral page. We just had another set of Imgur gifs go viral just a couple of weeks ago, and it still drives hundreds of thousands of views. I think it\u2019s really valuable as a channel to focus on the ones that can get you to these viral levels.</span></p>\n<h3 id=\"authenticity\"><span style=\"color: #ff6600\"><strong><b>2. Post authenticity, not advertisements</b></strong></span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The next piece is, for anything you\u2019re going to be posting, you want to make sure that it\u2019s actually authentic. So because all of our posts were set up to be dev blogs, we never said, \u201cHey, download this game right now or sign up.\u201d Instead, we\u2019d wait for the first comment to basically say, like, \u201cHey, how do I get the game?\u201d And then we\u2019d respond. Or someone in the community would respond with the link. And that gave the sense that this was genuinely authentic interest and that fed on itself.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">So when you\u2019re thinking about the posts you\u2019re putting out there, consider the tone you\u2019re structuring and think about how you\u2019re weaving players that come into it. Players will immediately detect if it feels like an advertisement. How can you make it authentic in terms of: you\u2019re sharing this because you\u2019re gamers, too, and you want people to see your game? That sort of stuff goes a really long way.</span></p>\n<h3 id=\"consistent-quality-content\"><span style=\"color: #ff6600\"><strong><b>3. Share quality content consistently</b></strong></span><b></b></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Once we started to get the ball rolling here, it was important to do it consistently. There are two reasons for this. The big one is that players start to expect to see content on a regular basis. So, at this point, the game was under NDA. So we had full control over when we would share content, but we set up this regular cadence for when our players could expect to see something new. The second piece is, I think it\u2019s important to build that muscle into your own team\u00e2\u0080\u0094to be posting content on a regular basis, but making sure it\u2019s good. The worst thing you can do is continue to keep up consistent content if it\u2019s just not good. If it\u2019s not working, you need to reevaluate if it\u2019s the channel, if it\u2019s the content, whatever it is. Don\u2019t just keep putting it out there, because I think you\u2019re wasting your time.</span></p>\n<h3 id=\"gifs\"><span style=\"color: #ff6600\"><strong><b>4. It\u2019s all about the GIF game</b></strong></span><b></b></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">For games right now, animated gifs and short-form video is incredibly important. If you haven\u2019t already had a conversation on how your game is going to show in an animated GIF, you need to have it. It doesn\u2019t have to be super-fast action skill shots, the way we had in Spellbreak, it could be, you know, poignant moments or touching moments or cute things or funny things.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">That stuff is incredibly necessary right now because the water cooler moments that people used to share in the office where they would say, like, \u00e2\u0080\u009cHey, you know, I was playing this cool game, or I fought this cool boss\u00e2\u0080\u009d no longer exist. They\u2019re all getting shared as animated gifs now, whether it be through TikTok or Instagram or whatever it is. So you really want to be thinking about: how does our game show as an animated gif? And if it doesn\u2019t show well, you should really be thinking about why.</span></p>\n<h3 id=\"enable-evangelists\"><span style=\"color: #ff6600\"><strong><b>5. Enable your evangelists</b></strong></span><b></b></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Once we had gotten a number of posts to go viral on a few of these channels, players were signing up for our pre-alpha. We used MailChimp for this. And once we had that interest, we tried to immediately tap into it further. So we basically made people wait about a week or two for a key. But we would say: if you come in through a referral, we\u2019ll give you a key immediately. And that drove a lot of people to say, \u201cHey, of my friends, you guys can get a key right now, you can skip the line.\u201d And that was really meaningful to drive a lot of our growth. At one point during the summer, like 60 percent to 70 percent of our signups that were all referrals.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">And some people were like super-referrers because they would be like, \u201cHey, I\u2019m posting this in my 500-person Discord server,\u00e2\u0080\u009d or \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u2019m posting this to Reddit\u00e2\u0080\u009d or whatever it is, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbe sure to use my name as a referer.\u00e2\u0080\u009d And we didn\u2019t give the referers any actual value. We didn\u2019t provide them with anything. I think that was a miss. I think we could have done something where we said, \u201cHey, if you refer X number of people, we\u2019ll give you a sweet outfit at launch.\u201d We didn\u2019t do that because we just didn\u2019t have the resources at the time, but even without any reason to do it, it was enough for people. People were so excited to be a referer and to share that they still did it. And it drove a massive number of signups for us.</span></p>\n<h3 id=\"community\"><span style=\"color: #ff6600\"><strong><b>6. Focus on a community nexus</b></strong></span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">We knew that email wasn\u2019t frequent enough to actually drive the community. So we focused the community into Discord. And the way we did that is we said, \u201cHey, once you sign up for a key, it\u2019ll take a week or two to get there. If you came in as a referral, we\u2019ll give it to you right away because we figured you were already tapped into the community because you had a referral.\u00e2\u0080\u009d But, if not, we would say, \u201cIf you want a key really fast, join our Discord \u201d And so what would happen is people would see a viral post on Imgur, and they would sign up for the email.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In the email we would say, \u201cHey, it\u2019s going to be about a week or two, depending on demand, for you to get a key. But if you join our Discord, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll probably get one tomorrow.\u201d That started to drive a ton of people into our Discord server. We knew that Discord was going to be really useful for us because we could engage directly with them and tap into that audience in a much better way than we could through any other social channel currently out there or through email.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<h3 id=\"flow-of-info\"><span style=\"color: #ff6600\"><strong><b>7. Control the flow of information</b></strong></span><b></b></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">So the next thing we did here is we had people under NDA. But here\u2019s a little secret. It wasn\u2019t a real, legally binding NDA\u00e2\u0080\u0094even though NDAs are kind of questionably legally binding. This was just a checkmark on the actual signup form. And there was just a checkmark that said, you know, I\u2019m going to participate and I agree to not stream or share any game details outside of the official Discord server. And that was it. We basically just threatened people that we would ban them if they did this. And almost no one did. A couple of people would do it occasionally, by accident. And the community would actually self-regulate. They would come in and go to that streamer and say, \u201cHey, this is under NDA. You can\u2019t share it.\u201d And it worked, even though we were up to, at one point at the very end of the beta, almost 200,000 players. At that point, we actually had to ban a couple of people because they were intentionally trying to share stuff. But it went nine months without us ever needing to actually do that.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">I think controlling this is really important because it allows you to build a lot of interest around anything that you\u2019re going to put out. And there\u2019s a real scarcity of content that you keep control over, and that becomes really valuable for every piece of content you then put out.</span></p>\n<h3 id=\"cool-kid-club\"><span style=\"color: #ff6600\"><strong><b>8. Create a cool kid club</b></strong></span><b></b></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Next, inside of the Discord we started to really build a community by having a number of reasons you wanted to be there. So if you were an actual tester, we had this Discord bot set up where you would send the Discord bot your key\u00e2\u0080\u0094the actual string from Steam, or we went through a couple of different platforms at that time. But you take your Steam key, and you would send it to the bot. The bot would check that to see if it actually was a real key and then give you a Discord role. That role would come in and unlock a series of different rooms for you. They were all private. They were all for testers only.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">And so it created this cool kids club for people that actually had that key and allowed them to engage with other testers and feel like they were getting secret info. Because at any given time only about a third of the people in the Discord were actually testers. There was a big group of people that were not. So those people were constantly asking, \u201cWhat\u2019s going on? Is the game fun? Is it worth waiting for?\u201d And all these people that were testers were like, \u201cYes, the game is super fun, definitely be excited. Your key is going to be coming soon.\u201d And it created this really interesting dynamic.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">On top of that, we also set up a bunch of reasons to be in Discord. Discord became the first place we posted everything. In our work in progress channel, we had developers on the team just drop-in a video of whatever they were working on that week, whenever they wanted to. At that time, we were doing weekly updates to the game.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">And it drove a bunch of interest because then the community knew that if they were on the inside paying attention to the Discord, they would see the newest stuff before anyone else. There was a meme that was shared on 9gag and a number of different sites about folks that didn\u2019t have a key yet. I think it really represents the build-up and value people get from actually being involved and engaged.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<h3 id=\"force-connections\"><span style=\"color: #ff6600\"><strong><b>9. Force social connections</b></strong></span><b></b></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Once we had all these folks in Discord, we basically forced them to become connected to each other. Spellbreak is a battle royale game. At the time, we didn\u2019t have enough developers on the Proletariat team to fill a full lobby ourselves. So we needed players in order to even test the game. We set up regularly scheduled playtests where we basically forced everyone that was playing to get into voice chat in Discord. What that meant was all of these people were starting to make friends with each other because they would get into Discord, they would start to chat, and they\u2019d be like, \u201cOh man, good play. You guys, you beat me last time. I got you this time.\u201d And we started to develop these social connections across this entire group of a few hundred players that became really strong and was really the undercurrent and basis for the community. Without us really pushing these playtests, I don\u2019t think it would have happened. Because I think that that sort of loose social connection of just being in text chat or whatever is not the same as forcing you to play with the same group of players, over and over again, for weeks.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">That was really valuable to create the undercurrent of the initial community for Spellbreak. It also gave the developers an opportunity to really engage with the players. I was often in these, frequently playing with players. And so there was tons of great feedback to be had out of that. But the real value, I think, was in establishing the social connections between the community and making them all comfortable playing with each other.</span></p>\n<h3 id=\"content-engine\"><span style=\"color: #ff6600\"><strong><b>10. Develop a community content generation engine</b></strong></span><b></b></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Having the game under NDA meant that no one could share content, but they wanted to make it. We built a highlights channel in our Discord, and we said, \u201cHey, you guys can use Streamable,\u00e2\u0080\u009d which doesn\u2019t have any externally facing links, \u00e2\u0080\u009cto create your highlights and share them with each other.\u201d We really tried to push them to give feedback to each other on what made a good highlight. And we eventually instituted a thing where we said, \u201cWe\u2019re going to take the best montage highlight reels, and we\u2019re going to post those to the official Spellbreak YouTube page.\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">That meant that people were training themselves to make great Spellbreak content by working as a community to give each other feedback. And they were incentivized because, since the game was under NDA, they could be one of the few people who got their sweet plays shown on the official Spellbreak YouTube. For us, it was awesome because it was just content we didn\u2019t have to create. These people did a better job than we could have at the time.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">This meant that we had a whole bunch of people making this content. Then when we actually went fully live into the closed alpha, when we lifted the NDA, we saw that so many of these people had this whole library of videos they dropped on day one. So right when we went live, there were a whole bunch of YouTube videos where people had 5, 6, 8, and they were already in their backlog and they were all awesome. They just dropped them all. And that was a huge benefit to us. It created interest and this positive attitude around content creation inside of the community really early, that I think was incredibly valuable to generate that kind of content.</span></p>\n<h3 id=\"sharing-flywheel\"><span style=\"color: #ff6600\"><strong><b>11. Establish a content sharing flywheel</b></strong></span><b></b></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Next, because we told the Discord community they were going to see everything first, we would share any of the public stuff that we put up there initially. The best example I can give of this is the pre-alpha teaser video that launched our YouTube channel in October of 2018. We had no followers in there. So initially we said, \u201cHey guys, can everyone follow the Spellbreak YouTube channel because we want to get enough subscribers to have the custom URL\u00e2\u0080\u009d. Once we had that, we posted 90 seconds of gameplay. And what ended up happening is so many people engaged with it coming out of the Discord, because we said, \u201cHey, you guys are going to see this an hour before we flip the switch to be public.\u00e2\u0080\u009d That made the video go viral on YouTube.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">This is one of the things that vaulted us in terms of size: it went viral on YouTube, and it got picked up organically by a number of different gaming websites and a number of different gaming influencers. Our Discord server doubled in size in four days. We went from 30,000 to 60,000 people in the course of 4 days. And that was all driven by this one piece of content. We basically said, \u201cEveryone come in here. Share, like, update, like, upvote this.\u201d And, you know, we started to do that with everything. So we\u2019d say, \u201cHey, you guys get to see this early, go check it out, like, comment, whatever.\u201d And that would really help us seed the engagement with all of our content when it started.</span></p>\n<h3 id=\"market-with-memes\"><span style=\"color: #ff6600\"><strong><b>12. Use memes as marketing</b></strong></span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">We also had a Discord meme channel set up, in the same way that we had a highlights channel. Lots of people would hang out there. We made the meme channel accessible to everyone, not just testers. I think that was really important because it meant that tons of people who didn\u2019t have a key yet could still be making memes. And the people that did have a key, the testers, could also be doing it as well. They built some of our best marketing campaigns ever. These memes would get shared out through their own channels, on their own Discord servers, on their own Twitter.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">They were giving us the best possible marketing about how valuable it was to have a Spellbreak key and how great the game was. Having that meme channel was incredibly useful. I kind of thought it was silly when we first added it. I was like, \u201cWhy did we do this?\u201d Then I saw the impact of these things getting posted all the time and I was like, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe really need to double down.\u00e2\u0080\u009d I think we\u2019re considering even more, how do you take this one step further? Because I think one of the big things to consider right now with an ongoing live-operated game like Spellbreak is the opportunity for it to become the memes that people create in the game. It almost becomes the medium of communication between friends.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">That\u2019s something that we\u2019re starting to see more and more in the way people are sharing and communicating. The more you can enable and train your community to do that, the more they\u2019re going to use it as a tool. And it doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t only benefit you, because mostly this is all inside baseball, right? It\u2019s all people in this public community sharing memes themselves. But occasionally, some of these memes break out, and they go outside of your community. And then you end up in a situation where a bunch of people in the Speller community are like, \u201cHaha, that\u2019s so funny,\u201d but there\u2019s a few people that are like, \u201cWhat game is this? What are you guys talking about?\u201d You\u00e2\u0080\u0099re able to attract free engagements, free new players because you\u2019ve built this community around sharing these memes.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">[</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Audience questions</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">]</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Andrew Green (a16z market development partner)</strong>: Thank you, Seth. That was awesome. So we\u2019ve got a bunch of questions here. The first one is: Have you tracked pre-alpha player retention versus launch or toward launch?</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Seth Sivak</strong>: Yeah. Some subset of those people are insanely engaged. They\u2019re some of our most engaged, they play every day. Some of them have thousands of hours in the game, which is just crazy. We did a calculation on the top 1 percent of Spellbreak players, and they basically play 40 hours a week. And they have since the summer of 2018. That\u2019s insane.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">One of the challenges in going through the process from pre-alpha to alpha to beta to where we are now, though, is that we changed the game a lot. The thing I would be conscious of is that while those users can be really great, you\u2019re basically torching them. So a bunch of players came in, and they really loved some of the original movement mechanics and the really, really high-skill cap the game had initially, and we changed that over time. And it\u2019s just, like, it\u2019s not the game they love anymore, and we\u2019ve lost them forever. That\u2019s fine because they were a really small subset. And I think at the time if we\u2019d kept on that same path, the game would be too niche. But I think you should expect to lose a lot of those players.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">One of the real reasons why we limited the number of keys we were giving out is we just wanted to have enough players in the game to get reasonable retention and metrics without torching those players. Because we figured a player will come in and we\u2019ll lose them, whereas if they\u2019re still waiting for a key and they haven\u2019t had a chance to play it yet, we know we\u2019re going to continue to increase retention. So let\u2019s use the minimum number of players possible to continue to get that information without using all of them. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s one of the reasons why we never did an open beta, because we figured that would be like a freeway to get rid of a lot of really great users knowing we\u2019re going to continue to invest in the game and increase their retention.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Andrew</strong>: Do you foresee an issue in scalability when using Discord as your central community hub?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Seth</strong>: Yeah, so we\u2019ve bumped into the upper limit a few times. The soft cap is about 300,000. So we basically call anyone who hasn\u2019t been active in a month. And that\u2019s like posting on a channel. I think you\u2019re seeing some of the bigger games now. There are some games that are bigger than us that are approaching the 500,000-person limit. I think there is some scalability concern. What we see now is a lot of sub-Discord spun-up by region. There\u2019s a number of competitive Spellbreak Discords. There\u2019s a Discord for Brazil and Germany and France and Japan. So there\u2019s a bunch of them, but we use Discord as the central hub for our main community stuff, mainly because we felt like it\u2019s the lowest barrier for us to possibly engage. But yeah, it\u2019s definitely a concern. We would not be able to actually moderate a community that size without an army of volunteer moderators.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">We have several people on the community team, but they spend a lot of time working with volunteer moderators. We have something like 15 or 20 of them. Some of them speak multiple languages, and we\u2019re very lucky to have that because otherwise, it would be completely unmanageable. But I think it\u2019s important these days to decide on a single focal point where you want to send people to be like, \u00e2\u0080\u009cHey, go ask your question in this server or in this Discord server or ask this question on Reddit\u00e2\u0080\u009d or whatever it is. More and more, I think you\u2019re better off choosing an existing platform than running your own forums. You know, our original game, we had our own forums on our own website, and I just don\u2019t think that\u2019s valuable anymore. I think you want to pick a single place and drive people there.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">I think it\u2019s important to do that early, because if you don\u2019t, the players will choose one and it might not be one you want. So, for example, if you don\u2019t have control over your own Reddit. We have our official Reddit because we were the creators of it, but that\u2019s not the case for a lot of other games. But then if you\u2019re not the owner and the moderator of that, that can be really scary. Or, you know, if all of your community is just going to the Steam forums, for example. You want to be thoughtful on where you want to send your community. Pick a place early and then stick to, \u201cHey, this is where everyone should go. You have a question, go here.\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Andrew</strong>: Merging off that, how do you leverage Reddit?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Seth</strong>: So, Reddit is a much smaller audience for us than Discord. We use Reddit for longer-form stuff that needs to be less ephemeral. Things in Discord move really quickly, as with any kind of chat sort of thing. So our official patch notes, for example, are anchored in Reddit because we think it does the best job to give people a chance to communicate with us. We do patch notes in there. We do other forms of content in there. That\u2019s where our official roadmap sits, rather than having kind of our own separate blog\u00e2\u0080\u0094which we do have and use occasionally. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099d rather do it straight in the Reddit.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">I don\u2019t know if Reddit\u2019s the right thing long-term because, again, I think we only have 19,000 or 20,000 people in our Reddit or something like that. It\u2019s definitely much smaller than our Discord, which has like 220,000 or something. So it\u2019s something that we don\u2019t use as much. Right now, though, the vast majority of the things on Reddit are memes. And that\u2019s what we\u2019ve seen from all of our channels, that they slowly get taken over by everyone just sharing memes. And we\u2019re kind of okay with that. But that\u2019s what we use Reddit for.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Andrew</strong>: How do you think TikTok changes things today? Does it at all?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Seth</strong>: Yeah, I think it will. I think it\u2019s still very much the Wild West. I don\u2019t think anyone really knows what to do about it. Spellbreak has a lot of views. But at the end of the day, the vast majority of the stuff that\u2019s getting shared for Spellbreak is still gameplay clips, whether it\u2019s TikTok or Instagram or any of these other places. Now, we might get to a point where we have some sort of insane cultural relevance, like Fortnite does, where people are sharing the Spellbreak dances or whatever. But I think right now I see it as another avenue for sharing your sweet gameplay clips or your memes.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">So I think it will be another useful channel. We\u2019re all trying to figure out how to leverage it effectively. It seems like there are not quite as many tools to do that, because it\u2019s not really a social network. It\u2019s not like, you know, everyone that follows Spellbreak will see the Spellbreak content all that often, because of the way the algorithm currently works. But it\u2019s definitely something where you absolutely should be caring about it and thinking about it. With the monster growth in the last six months, it\u2019s become a much, much bigger channel when we do surveys of our community. We ask, \u201cWhat social networks do you use?\u201d And I think it\u2019s grown from like only 12 percent or 14 percent of our community to like 60 percent of our community is now on TikTok, just over the last six months.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Andrew</strong>: Wow. Interesting. Can you give a high-level overview of who managed these efforts for the studio? Was it the dev team or the marketing folks? How did you scale that team, and how much time did you dedicate to that ramp?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Seth</strong>: We had a couple of people focus on this. We had, at the time, our community director, who\u2019s now our global head of marketing. He did a lot of the early stuff with Imgur. And then it was really a group of only like three or four people that were working part-time on it, as well as the full-time community manager for the early stuff. That was really built around wrangling the content internally, getting help from the development team to get, like, cool animated gifs made and doing the work to actually post it. We sort of relied on the entire dev team to help with the engagement on Discord. Having them drop clips of what they were working on or join in the playtest was really valuable.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">You don\u2019t need a large team to start this, but I do think it\u2019s really important to have one or two people that are focused on your growth side and creating that content and actually doing that work. And the sooner you can start to slice off resources to actually be developing that sort of content or enabling your community to develop that content, the better off you\u2019re going to be because it\u2019s always going to be a challenge to prioritize it against the development team.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Andrew</strong>: Did you engage in direct moderation and admin of your communities on Discord, or was it mostly pushed content or moderated by moderators that you onboarded? When did that start to change?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Seth</strong>: So when we were small, when it was only like 15,000, 20,000 people, it was all internal. We didn\u2019t have any moderators. It was basically a couple of people on the development team and our director of community at the time. We were all moderating it because it wasn\u2019t\u2026 We could wake up in the morning and read all the activity really quickly.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Then as soon as we kind of broke out of that level, it became completely unmanageable really fast. But we have always done a lot of work to train the volunteer moderators. So it was still really hands-on. At the end of the day, there\u2019s only a handful of admins that can actually do stuff. It would still rely on the moderators flagging, \u00e2\u0080\u009cHey, this person is spamming\u00e2\u0080\u009d or whatever, and then someone would have to go in and manage it.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">It wasn\u2019t until we grew to the size we are now that we had a lot of people managing it overall. When we were small, though, that smaller community, you can do it with just a handful of people kind of part-time, because there isn\u2019t a lot of interest and upside and people coming in and kind of ruining the community at that point because there aren\u2019t enough eyeballs. But once you get above, I would say 20,000, 30,000 people, you need to take it much more seriously because then there\u2019s enough people in there for people to find it interesting to spam.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Andrew</strong>: Got it. So yeah, we\u2019ll do one more question. How do you plan on carrying the momentum? As you said earlier, you changed the game a bunch, and some of the earliest folks in the community got burned. A lot of them were retained. As it keeps growing, how do you continue to engage, from after the beta ends to the upcoming full release? Especially when you don\u2019t have a formal release date.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Seth</strong>: Yeah, things definitely shift. If I could do it all again, I would have kept the game under NDA longer. I would have kept it so that we could have been in control of that information and sharing content on a more regular cadence. The biggest thing that we\u2019re focused on right now, as we get close to release, is we\u2019re up to about 1.7 million or 1.8 million people that have signed up during the course of the pre-alpha, the alpha, and the beta. And so we\u2019re obviously going to be leveraging all of those people on the email side. We\u2019re also doing some straight, traditional marketing, we\u2019re doing some digital spend, and we\u2019re doing a bunch of influencer spend, as well as trying to do as much as we can organically with influencers, too. So that\u2019s a big piece, but what we\u2019re hoping to do is start to activate the super-engaged that are still in our Discord to really help propel that.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">So our lead-up to launch includes a 10-day countdown that is going to be a bunch of content that we really want them to start to amplify. And we\u2019re doing something similar here, where effectively we\u2019re going to be opening up several different play sessions for different regions to come in and see the launch version of the game early and capture video, whether they be from the journalist side or the influencer side, so that they have their videos ready to go that are under embargo for launch day. We\u2019re still sticking to a lot of the similar tactics, it\u2019s just at a different scale. We\u2019re trying to back that up with some more traditional marketing spend, now that we\u2019re like on the very edge of launching.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Andrew</strong>: Awesome. Thank you so much for the presentation and for the Q&amp;A, Seth. That was super informative.</span></p>\n<div class=\"entry-content__post-body wp-content\">\n<div class=\"entry-content__post-body wp-content\">\n<div class=\"entry-content__post-body wp-content\">\n<p style=\"text-align: center\">***</p>\n<p><em>The views expressed here are those of the individual AH Capital Management, L.L.C.

In this episode, David Banks, a former Riot Games executive who\u2019s now the co-founder and CEO of Elodie Games, and Timmu T\u00c3\u00b5ke, the co-founder and CEO of Ready Player Me, a leading platform for cross game avatars, join a16z General Partner and games investor Jon Lai for a conversation about where they think the metaverse is going and the future of building games.\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<h3>Transcript</h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Jon Lai:</strong> So, my name is Jon, I\u2019m one of the GPs in the <a href=\"https://a16z.com/2022/05/18/games-fund-one-building-the-future-of-games/\">a16z Games Fund One</a>. And I\u2019m deeply honored to be here today with two founders building the future of games. Why don\u2019t you go around and introduce yourselves briefly, maybe starting with you, David?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>David Banks:</strong> Sure. David Banks, CEO of Elodie Games, we\u2019re building the next generation of cross-play games. We really look to connect players around the globe through deeply engaging experiences.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Timmu T\u00c3\u00b5ke:</strong> Hi, my name is Timmu, we\u2019re building Ready Player Me. It\u2019s a cross-game avatar platform for the metaverse. The metaverse is not one place, or one app, or one game, it\u2019s a network of thousands of different worlds. So it makes sense for users to have an avatar that travels with them across many different virtual worlds. And that\u2019s what we give to the kind of users of the metaverse. And from a developer\u2019s point of view, when you\u2019re building a virtual world or game, you have to build an avatar system or character system for a game. And we solve that problem and give them a character system they can integrate in a few days. And we work with like 3,000 different companies that are using our avatars across many applications in the metaverse.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Jon:</strong> Let\u2019s talk about LA for a bit. So David, you spent most of your professional career here in LA and you\u2019re also a Dodgers fan, I see.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>David:</strong> We\u2019re actually going to the game tonight as a team. So, we\u2019ll squeeze that in somehow.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Jon:</strong> That\u2019s awesome. So, you\u2019ve worked at Riot Games, you\u2019ve worked at Bird, you attended UCLA. And Timmu, you have many, many partners at Ready Player Me that are based here in LA. Maybe talk a bit about how you\u2019ve seen the startup environment for LA, specifically, for game developers and metaverse builders evolve over the last couple of years?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>David:</strong> Sure. I moved to LA for Riot in 2008. Activision was here and Blizzard was down South and there really wasn\u2019t a lot of a landscape here at first and attracting. Of course, you have Hollywood and all the creative talent here. But for engineering, and game engineering, and back-end engineering, we were pulling in people from all over the place, all over the country, all over the world to come and work here in LA. And it\u2019s evolved so much since then, I think Riot is a huge LA success story. Look at something like, you know, other companies like Snap are huge stories. And now there\u2019s, games alone, you know this number better than I, probably 20-plus games startups in LA alone. So, it\u2019s changed a lot.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Timmu:</strong> Yeah. I was actually based in LA, like, five years ago for a year. I went to LA Tech Week five years ago. It was a lot different. So, it\u2019s definitely been a great development. And we have partners here, a lot of creative minds here. Both the kind of metaverse, the creative part of the metaverse, and Web3 comes from LA. So it\u2019s definitely good to see how it\u2019s changed.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Jon:</strong> And why do you think there are so many game developers here in LA? Like, what are the pros and cons of being a game developer here versus another city?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>David:</strong> It\u2019s a hub, it\u2019s a center, right? You can come here, you can find the job of your dreams, you can find the exact game, or company, or role that you\u2019re looking for here because there are so many opportunities. And so, I think it just sort of builds upon it, it becomes a snowball and just sort of builds on itself. That\u2019s great. I think there\u2019s a lot of opportunities here. I think folks like a16z have identified that and have really come in and helped nourish the environment, and that\u2019s been helpful as well.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Jon:</strong> Let\u2019s shift gears a bit and talk about a topic that I think has been the subject of a lot of debate and potentially controversy recently, which is the metaverse. So, as a game developer, as a platform developer, what is your view with the metaverse? What is it? How close are we to it?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>David:</strong> Jon always says my answer is a very Web2 answer. I don\u2019t know whether to be insulted by that or not. But we\u2019ll figure that out later. But I feel like\u2026I\u2019m a lifelong gamer. I\u2019ve been playing games forever. And as a gamer, I\u2019ve always used gaming platforms and tools like VENT or even now Discord, to gather with my friends and interact. And, sort of, gaming has always been the excuse. But now there\u2019s so much more for us to do in games, we can not only play games, but we can watch our favorite sports, we can listen to music, we can go to concerts. Like, we\u2019re already doing all of these things, but they\u2019re really geared around hardcore gamers. And I think that the folks who are looking in from the outside and they\u2019re seeing all this stuff going on, without being controversial, I feel like they\u2019re trying to give what they\u2019re seeing a name. And I always say, \u201cOh, they\u2019ve labeled it the metaverse,\u201d right? And I do think that there\u2019s potential to broaden that audience for creating experiences and excitement for people who aren\u2019t the 1000-hour gamers like myself.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Timmu:</strong> Yeah. For one side, the metaverse is here. 2 billion people are playing games every year. We\u2019re looking at what, like 10 to 15-year-olds do, they spend a lot of time in Roblox, and Fortnite, and Minecraft. A lot of their social interactions they have with their friends are actually in the metaverse, so in a virtual world already. And those kids grow up and they will start using products with avatars maybe for work and then so forth. That\u2019s the behavior \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the fact that people spend a lot of time in virtual is already here. What\u2019s missing, from our point of view, is all those worlds are closed ecosystems, all those worlds are separated, closed, walled gardens that don\u2019t exist together. The metaverse is not one game, it\u2019s a network of thousands of different virtual worlds and games and so forth.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Jon:</strong> What you\u2019re referring to is that if you play Minecraft, that you can\u2019t pick any of your items over to another game like Fortnite or Roblox, and so on.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Timmu:</strong> Exactly. Like if you play several games, you have a different avatar for each game, you have different economy in each game, you can\u2019t transfer between them. So it\u2019s not a connective metaverse. And for the real metaverse to happen, there needs to be cross-game services and protocols and standards that link those worlds together. And avatars are a major part of that, that\u2019s why we\u2019re working on avatars. Anyone should be able to play an avatar within the cross-worlds. And that helps connect the metaverse a little bit more and push it to\u00c2\u00a0 the open metaverse centers.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Jon:</strong> What, in your view, are some of the benefits that you get from breaking down these walled gardens and enabling interoperability that we don\u2019t see today? Since as you mentioned, we only have 3 billion gamers, it feels like they\u2019re very happy playing Fortnite, Roblox, Minecraft, the games of today. What is it that\u2019s missing that could be improved with interoperability?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Timmu:</strong> Very broadly, there are two paths to the future of the metaverse. One is a closed metaverse which is owned by one company or a few companies that make all the rules. And the other is an open metaverse, which is built by millions of different creators that are all collaborating, the worlds are interlinked, and everybody can take part and nobody controls the metaverse, nobody makes the rules. And it\u2019s partly or mostly owned by the creators and the builders of those things, or it is owned by the builder.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Anyways, the open metaverse is a better future for all of us here. The metaverse is powerful, we\u2019re going to spend a lot of time in it. So we don\u2019t want it to be controlled by one company. For the open metaverse to exist, there need to be cross-game services, interoperability, each be able to transfer items between games. And that really builds the ground for open metaverse to exist. And just practically, would you want to have a thousand different avatars for a thousand different games? You just want to have one identity, it\u2019s consistent across worlds? And also, as a developer, when you sell skins and outdoor accessories, for example, do users want to buy something that is stuck in one game or travels across the metaverse?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Jon:</strong> It\u2019s more valuable.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Timmu:</strong> Exactly. And stays where you can use it throughout your metaverse lifecycle.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Jon:</strong> David, what\u2019s your reaction to that?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>David:</strong> I will step aside from my engineering roots and wonder about all the technical hurdles between here and there. My question is really: standards. You\u2019ve talked about shared services and things like that. You need the protocols, you need standards, and how do those get established and agreed upon? How do you imagine that being a community-driven effort or how does that get solved?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Timmu:</strong> We already have three dozen companies we work with who use our avatars. And all of them are using different standards. Like, they use a different platform. They use a different rate. And we just work around it and offer it in whatever spec that the developer needs. So, that\u2019s how we make the interoperability happen as a centralized party essentially, today.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">I think for the industry to figure out standards and protocols, it needs to be clear that an interoperable economy or interoperable systems for a better user experience and better business model. And for that to happen, some kind of a proto-metaverse needs to exist and show everyone that it builds a bigger economy and there\u2019s a better way to build games. And then, there\u2019s motivation for people to figure out the standards and protocols and agree on them. Right now it\u2019s just a concept. And you can work around it, but it\u2019s not going to tip the entire industry overnight.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>David:</strong> If you had a bet, do you think you end up with the sort of closed-world metaverse or sort of an open metaverse?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Timmu:</strong> I think there\u2019ll be a little bit of a mix. So there will be definitely platforms that they want to build a closed world and then can build a closed world. And then there will be a big part of open metaverses as well that exist side by side.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Jon:</strong> Awesome. And it\u2019s interesting that one of the thesis that we have is that games are next-generation social networks. That kids that are growing up today, they\u2019re largely not on Facebook, they\u2019re not on Snapchat, they\u2019re spending all their time in these virtual worlds that these gentlemen are building. And then if you continue advancing that sort of social network thesis, we\u2019ll also notice that there are several social networks that exist today that are large and very successful. Like, we have Snapchat, we have Instagram, we have Facebook, we have LinkedIn, we have Discord. And so there\u2019s no one-winner-take-all social network. And it\u2019s interesting to think that games might evolve similarly, where you also have kids that are going between Minecraft, and Roblox, and Fortnite, and League of Legends, and they are all very healthy social communities that you might find different social graphs within each one.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Let me change tactics and talk about, there are two technologies that many people associate with the metaverse. I think the first is VR, virtual reality, and then the second is Web3, which we touched on a little bit with interoperability. Maybe let\u2019s start with VR first. An interesting factor that I\u2019m very excited about is that Meta recently announced that the Oculus Quest 2 had shipped 15 million units since launch in Q4 2020. This is actually more than the number of Xboxes, I think the last generation of Xboxes that have been shipped. It\u2019s a notable milestone. What\u2019s your reaction to that, and sort of what\u2019s your stance on the future of VR going forward from there?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>David:</strong> VR is so difficult for me, because it\u2019s a platform that today I can\u2019t use. I\u2019m one of the few people who get super-nauseous. But I think once the technology allows everyone to participate\u2026</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Timmu:</strong> Hardware improvements.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>David:</strong> Yeah, hardware improvements, also cost, as a barrier to entry. I think you can really start to talk about real permeation in the marketplace.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Timmu:</strong> Yeah. I mean, VR was the reason we kind of started putting out just nine years ago\u2026\u00c2\u00a0 but it took a lot longer to get here. As a company, we\u2019re not making a bet on VR, I think it will be a part of metaverse. The more people will have interesting experiences, the more developed and we\u2019ll figure out. So, just that kind of a tailwind for the metaverse generally, but it\u2019s not like the core part, it\u2019s not gonna be a core part of the metaverse for a bit of time.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Jon:</strong> And one of the challenges for VR app developers is the requirement, since you\u2019re in a 3D space, that you need to have an avatar. In general, it\u2019s much more difficult to build a 3D avatar than a 2D one and so on and so forth.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Timmu:</strong> Exactly. It is. So, we have a lot of VR companies who use our avatars. And in VR, it\u2019s like, when you\u2019re speaking with an avatar, it\u2019s like very much in your face. It really matters. Like, if it\u2019s a bad avatar, it\u2019s a terrible experience. And VR, it doesn\u2019t matter: that\u2019s who you are and that\u2019s who your friends are when you speak with them.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Jon:</strong> Yeah. Just maybe zooming up one level to talk about avatars in general, there\u2019s been a trend of VTubing, right, where you have VTubers streaming and creating videos using an avatar instead of their real-life selves. This is happening on Twitch as well. Do you feel that the trend that people representing themselves publicly using the avatars over their real-life selves will continue?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Timmu:</strong> Yeah, for sure. I mean, avatars lower the barrier of upgrading content because you don\u2019t have to put your identity out there, you just have this avatar representation. It can look like you, it doesn\u2019t have to look like you, and you can create content with it, you can represent yourself as an avatar. And as the technology improves, as there\u2019s more better tracking solutions and easier tracking solutions, I think that they\u2019ll only continue evolving. And also, when you can use your avatar for streaming, you can actually use it in games, you can use it on social media \u00e2\u0080\u0094 it becomes consistent across your entire virtual experience.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Jon:</strong> It\u2019s also very powerful. It\u2019s something that we see in games often. Your idealized self can sometimes be represented better digitally than your life, right? You can be anyone that you want in the metaverse, in a video game, and so on.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Timmu:</strong> Yeah.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Jon:</strong> Yeah. Last topic is Web3, which, I know, has also been controversial. There have been many gamers that have had sort of an allergic reaction to NFTs. Like Minecraft recently announced that they were actually banning NFTs from that platform. Is there something that you think players are misunderstanding here, are you sympathetic to that? What\u2019s your reaction?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>David:</strong> I don\u2019t think players are missing anything. I think it\u2019s developers who are missing something. I think that players, especially hardcore gamers, have been doing a lot of things that, not all, but a lot of things that NFTs are being marketed as to a player, right? \u201cHey, we\u2019ve now put our game on top of blockchain. And now you\u2019re able to trade, now you\u2019re able to own, now you\u2019re able to accrue value,\u201d etc. I played some CS:GO. I\u2019ve played some Val. I\u2019ve definitely gone on some shady black-market websites and bought new accounts. Sorry, if anyone\u2019s from Blizzard. And these things have existed, but they\u2019re not safe, and they\u2019re not secure, and they\u2019re not repeatable. And there\u2019s value there for players that they\u2019ve interacted with. But I think that when the UX looks very crypto on the surface, \u201cHere\u2019s my wallet, I gotta sign in. I gotta exchange for currency,\u201d it\u2019s off-putting. And I think that players will go to anywhere where there\u2019s true player value, right?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">And I think that the blockchain probably is a brilliant technology that provides a lot of capabilities that players currently value, right? But I think that there\u2019s a lot of folks in the Web3 space who are creating a UX. And you don\u2019t know that\u2019s what you\u2019re doing. I think that\u2019s a brilliant approach, right? I think, as a gamer, if I put my game on the chain, or, you know, I really target Web3 as a core to my product, I want players to discover that as they unwrap the onion, right? You should be able to sign in just like any free-to-play game, you should start to play, you should start to earn. And then you can discover these things, right? I think that\u2019s the key.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Timmu:</strong> Yeah. I think people hate the concept of NFTs, not what they provide, the ownership. So, it\u2019s like the speculation and stuff like that gamers receive from the site versus what\u2019s going on in the market. And that\u2019s kind of like what people are hating, not the ownership it provides. And as more applications come out, that just really use the value of NFTs, and also like cross-game, add to those. Because yeah, you can own an asset in one game but then NFTs and blockchain really helps separate the ownership for a particular game and make it usable across many worlds. And it\u2019s just another reality today. When those things happen, then it\u2019s more kind of an obvious, divided agreement.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Jon:</strong> It\u2019s very clear that we\u2019re still in the early innings of Web3, and a lot of the promise of it is going to be ultimately carried out by builders like yourselves that are building at the frontier. And with that, I think we\u2019re actually out of time. So, thank you, David and Timmu for discussing the future of games with us.</span></p>\n<div class=\"wp-content\">\n<p style=\"text-align: center\">***</p>\n<p><i>The above transcript is abridged and edited for clarity.</i></p>\n<p><i>The views expressed here are those of the individual AH Capital Management, L.L.C.

I\u2019m Sonal and I\u2019m here today with our co-founder, Ben Horowitz and our managing partner, Scott Kupor, and we\u2019re here to talk about a controversial and important discussion around stock options for compensating employees, and the nuances of timing the vesting of them. Well, let me just give some more context. We recently wrote <a href=\"https://a16z.com/2016/06/23/options-timing/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">a post</a> that talked about some of the problems with the current 90-day system and what\u2019s great about this is it\u2019s generated a lot of <a href=\"https://dangelo.quora.com/10-Year-Exercise-Periods-Make-Sense\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">healthy discussion</a>, but let\u2019s first start off with where we agree in broad strokes.</p>\n<p>Ben: Well, I think, look, it\u2019s important to go back when you look at a system redesign to how did the original system come into place. So it started in the 80s with the advent of stock options, and the original motivation for it was actually very smart in that when you\u2019re talking about software engineering, yes you can build a product to do something, but how you build it matters even more than what the actual functionality is at the end, and to get kind of to a level where people are really invested in what they\u2019re building, it made sense to make the people building that software be owners in the company. That was a great innovation, and as part of that, the ownership agreements were written in a way that was compliant with the then-accounting laws.</p>\n<p>The then-accounting laws basically said that if you gave an employee more than a very short window to exercise, you would potentially create a very large accounting charge which would make it impossible for the company to ever go public or be acquired or anything like that, and that you wouldn\u2019t be able to predict earnings and all kinds of other things from a technical accounting standpoint. That was just the way it was and nobody questioned it from its origin to the early 2000s, and then following the great stock option scandal of the early 2000s \u2014</p>\n<p>SC: What was that scandal, by the way? I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about.</p>\n<p>Ben: Well, it was a stock option pricing scandal. So basically people were saying that companies were picking non-random dates to price their stock options, and a bunch of people went to jail and people got fined and all that kind of thing. So they changed the law, and the new law kind of made it okay to have a longer exercise period, but nobody changed the practice. Wait a minute, if you\u2019re rich and you have 90 days to exercise, that\u2019s fine because you can buy your stock options, but if you\u2019re not rich, then you can\u2019t, and so now we\u2019ve created this class thing. That class thing always existed. There was just no way to solve it until more recently.</p>\n<p>SC: What do you mean by \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe class thing\u00e2\u0080\u009d?</p>\n<p>Ben: So basically if you have money, then you can pay to purchase your shares, and if you don\u2019t have money, then you can\u2019t afford to pay, and they expire after 90 days. So a lot of the employees are employees who, for whatever reason, didn\u2019t have enough cash, couldn\u2019t basically acquire their ownership position. Now, the acquisition of that ownership position has risk in that you\u2019re buying the stock at that price, and so if the company fails you lose your money. So the option is actually more valuable. It\u2019s better to have 10 years to vest even if you\u2019re rich.</p>\n<p>SC: Right, because you have the optionality to sort of exercise at the best possible time.</p>\n<p>Ben: Right, exactly. So Adam D\u00e2\u0080\u0099Angelo solved that rich/poor dichotomy by introducing the 10-year vest; however, created a new set of issues, which Scott outlined in the blog post. The issues are, one, you\u2019ve made compensation packages far more valuable in that a 10-year option is much more valuable than having to buy the stock in 90 days no matter who you are. Then there are a couple of knock-on effects, one is that the stock in your company in the old model, when somebody would leave, would typically basically come back into the pool, and that just meant the overall dilution over a long period of time would be lower, which affects all owners and employees. So employees who got, say, .1% of the company would actually get less of the company in a 10-year exercise scheme than in a 90-day exercise scheme.</p>\n<p>So then that kind of goes to the question of, well, rather than making one fix now that we have the new accounting law, should we take a step back and say, \u201cWell, the accounting law changed and we didn\u2019t reexamine it, and the time to go public changed and we didn\u2019t reexamine it, and we also live in a much different world than in the 80s. Should we take a look at how you design an employee stock option program now?\u201d <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through;\"><br/>\n</span><br/>\nScott: I think Adam did a great job introducing a new concept, and certainly lots of companies implement the 10-year extension period, and we felt like there hadn\u2019t at least been a discussion of all the issues that this principle raised. So that was really the motivation behind doing it.</p>\n<p>At a high level, the biggest thing that\u2019s changed is we used to have four-year options with this 90-day option to exercise in a period where companies used to go public in four or six years on average. And so what would often happen is an employee\u2019s options would be fully vested, they might choose to leave the company at that point in time, but often they had an option for liquidity, meaning they could exercise the option within that 90 days and then they could turn around and immediately sell the stock because often times the company was public at that point in time, and so there was already a liquid market.</p>\n<p>And what we have today is because the IPO timeframes have been so elongated now, not only is the stock illiquid, and therefore if you exercise in that 90-day window you take risk obviously for the stock, but it also means that if you allow people to extend for this 10-year period, then you do have lots of stock that may dilute the ability of existing employees to be able to get incremental stock options, the ones who are still there working on behalf of the company. So it\u2019s really this change in the IPO timeframe I think that really causes a lot of the kind of dichotomy that we\u2019ve been trying to discuss here.</p>\n<p>SC: Is it really a tension between early employees and late employees? Because on one hand, frankly, those early employees took on a hell of a lot more risk to take a chance on the company and actually de-risk and build something that later employees want to come to. So are we in essence pitting, when we talk about this longer period, are we really pitting early employees against later employees? Is that the red herring in the conversation? Or is that the crux of it?</p>\n<p>Ben: I think that\u2019s not correct in the following sense, in that early employees also get more stock options than later employees. Generally the way it works is that if you come in early you get a bigger package. Depending on the company, some companies do that in a way that turns out to be very fair, and other times they get it wrong. It\u2019s kind of a complicated equation because you don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen along the way.</p>\n<p>Scott: The other thing on early versus late employees to remember is there has always been an imbalance or dichotomy in early or late employees. One, which Ben mentioned of course, that certainly early employees, rightly so, get more stock because obviously they\u2019re taking on higher risk. The other thing that the early employees typically have available to them is what\u2019s called 83B, which allows them to essentially early exercise their options when the strike price is still very low and therefore the cash out of pocket required to do so is relatively minimal, and they also don\u2019t have a tax event at that point in time. So what often happens for early employees is they eliminate this 90-day exit window issue because they\u2019ve already early exercised their stock at a point where the stock price was cheap enough that it was financially viable for most people to do so. So that issue has always existed; we\u2019ve always had this early versus later employee issue if nothing else then in the form of this 83B.</p>\n<p>Ben: I think the big thing is, what are you designing the company around, and why do people have ownership, and who do you want owning the company both as kind of the founder, and then also from the employee\u2019s perspective \u2014 the employees who stay the entire time, the employees who stay for four years, the employees who stay for one year \u2014 and I think you really have to take all that into consideration as you design the program.</p>\n<p>We had a program designed with a set of accounting rules and, as Scott mentioned, a kind of expectation of when it would pay out that are no longer valid. So you kind of have to go back and look. One of the things we take for granted that\u2019s also in there is, okay, one year cliff, four years is vested equally, is the fourth year more valuable? Is the third year more valuable? These are, I think, important questions in that what you\u2019re really trying to do is to get people to take ownership in the company and build the company. And as the person who founds the company, what do you think that means? What is the tenure that you want for ownership?</p>\n<p>We\u2019ve seen people experiment with this model. Snapchat I think is doing a very interesting innovation by having most of the vesting occur later in the fourth year as opposed to in the first year, and that\u2019s just a way of saying, \u201cLook, if you\u2019re here, that fourth year is just more valuable to us.\u201d I think objectively it is, but that\u2019s not reflected either in the current compensation scheme.</p>\n<p>Scott: The other that I think is also interesting is Tesla, which goes less to vesting but more towards how you think about sizing option grants based on seniority and tenure of employees, and one of the things that Tesla does is instead of the typical practice which is most people a very significant grant the day they join the company and then over time they might get some refresher grants, but those refresher grants are often a fraction of what their initial grant was.</p>\n<p>Tesla kind of reverses that and says, \u201cWe don\u2019t really know that much about the employee day one when they come here. We\u2019ll know more over years one, two, three as they actually perform,\u201d and so what they often do is give a smaller package up front and actually give people who perform well more options later in their tenure to recognize the fact that, you know, their contribution is much better known at that point in time, and therefore it makes more sense to have an option package that reflects their actual contribution to the business.</p>\n<p>SC: So it strikes me that that there\u2019s a conflation between tenure and value that an employee contributes. So someone could contribute tremendous value to a company in year one or year four, or in year 10. You just have as a proxy, they\u2019ve been here for one year, four years, 10 years, whatever the period is. Is there a way to sort of decouple the tenure from the actual value contributed?</p>\n<p>The kind of employee you attract, say, in the first five years might be very different than the employee you attract in the last five years. I mean there are so many different factors that come into play as we talk about this. Because essentially no matter what model you set up for it, it seems like you have an adverse selection problem where you\u2019re either optimizing very much for the type of people who don\u2019t want mobility, because frankly if I were a startup employee, after vesting I have earned that. Those are mine. Why wouldn\u2019t I want to be mobile? And wouldn\u2019t you want an employee like me who wants to be mobile and has the type of talent that can go anywhere?</p>\n<p>Ben: Well, I think there are a few parts. So one, the knowledge is actually very valuable. If I write a complex software system and I walk out the door, there is some of that knowledge I will transfer, but a lot of that knowledge walks with me. One of the things you\u2019re trying to value with tenure is knowledge, not actually the value of the work in a single point in time.</p>\n<p>SC: Just one thing to probe more on this idea \u2014 the value for Silicon Valley, the whole thing that built the value, the non-compete, etc. \u2014 is this mobility of employees. So what if I contribute disproportionate value to a company in the first two years, and someone else who came along and stuck around for 10 years did a good job but did not even create nearly as much value as I did. So why can\u2019t we optimize for that?</p>\n<p>Ben: Yeah, that\u2019s a great question. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a dirty little secret, the obvious big secret is that the system is actually much more unfair than you\u2019re giving it credit for. It\u2019s unfair in the following sense: that your stock option package that you got before you put that two years in where you did 10X what everybody else did was set on work you did before you even got there.</p>\n<p>SC: You\u2019re right. No one even knows that value.</p>\n<p>Ben: Yeah. So if I came from some Canadian company that nobody ever heard of and you came from Google and you got 5X the stock option package walking in the door than I did \u2014</p>\n<p>SC: And yet you created more value \u2014</p>\n<p>Ben: And I come in and create more value \u2014 I don\u2019t get paid for that today, independent of mobility. That is a very difficult issue because it has to do with your market value. People do things to build their market value, and once they have it they\u2019re not going to take the job for less than that, and they could take a job, got a big package, come in and not perform whereas somebody who, for whatever reason, has lower market value is going to get an unfair treatment. That\u2019s really \u2014</p>\n<p>SC: That sucks, yeah.</p>\n<p>Ben: Maybe there\u2019s a theory that reconciles that. I don\u2019t know what it is.</p>\n<p>SC: I mean because on the back-end trying to have a founder then make up for that, say, initial market value and then try to disproportionately say, \u201cI\u2019m going to give you some extra stock options or make an exception,\u201d that can also lead to favoritism and other issues.</p>\n<p>Ben: Well, I think the big problem is you don\u2019t have infinite stock. So absolutely you can give a performance grant, but there\u2019s no company that I know of that allocates more money to performance grants than new-hire grants. So the new-hire grant where you know the least about the employee is kind of where most of this happens. And look, it\u2019s not a statement of mobility or making somebody an indentured bond servant or anything like that.</p>\n<p>SC: Yeah, that\u2019s the part that I resist. I don\u2019t want to be stuck in one place for like 10 years.</p>\n<p>Ben: Yeah. You ought to design it so there\u2019s compelling compensation for those kinds of employees. Particularly if those are the kinds of employees that you want; then you ought to incent that.\u00c2\u00a0On the other hand it depends on position, too. You might want somebody to come and do that in one kind of job, but if they\u2019re the architect of \u2014</p>\n<p>SC: The infrastructure.</p>\n<p>Ben: \u2013The core of the database infrastructure or whatever, then maybe a year is not long enough to do that job correctly. Maybe it\u2019s a four-year job. Maybe it\u2019s a three-year job.</p>\n<p>SC: That\u2019s a great point.</p>\n<p>Ben: Whereas there may be a very specific kind of thing that you can come in and get it done in six months. So compensation is complex. And I think you have to embrace the complexity rather than just rail against people who point out that it\u2019s complex.</p>\n<p>SC: You\u2019re not arguing that someone who\u2019s vested should not get their options, obviously.</p>\n<p>Ben: Absolutely you should be paid for the work that you\u2019re doing. But there\u2019s a question for the company of, how do you want to pay people? Maybe the right scheme \u2014 and I\u2019m not proposing a scheme \u2014 but maybe the right scheme is to pay much more cash early and then make ownership a later, binding thing, because ownership is significant in other ways, in that it has to do with the governance and the ability of the company to do everything from raise money to acquire companies to do all kinds of things over time.</p>\n<p>So what is the threshold for ownership? I think it\u2019s one thing in a world with 90-day exercise and another thing in a world with 10-year exercise, and not saying that means you have to be on 90 days. It just says if you\u2019re going to be on 10 years, you\u2019ve got to deal with that fact and not just sweep it under the rug. Let\u2019s get it out from under the rug, let\u2019s talk about it, and let\u2019s design a system that works for whatever you want your company to be.</p>\n<p>SC: So whatever you\u2019re optimizing for basically as a founder?</p>\n<p>Ben: Well, yes, what do you want the incentive on the company to be? How much do people have to care about the actual company themselves? If we\u2019re just talking pure compensation, then I think cash is actually a better vehicle than stock, because one, stock is variant and you may not get paid not because you can\u2019t vest, but because the thing goes to zero. Is that really your fault as an employee? Probably not. It\u2019s probably the CEO\u2019s, probably the founder\u2019s, fault if the thing goes to zero, not your fault. So why are you penalized on that?</p>\n<p>So that kind of gets into, are we really doing the right thing by paying everybody with large upfront option packages? Or should we have more cash up front, more ownership back unloaded for the people who are like, \u201cWell, forget mobility, whatever. This is my mission, to build this thing\u201d? Should those be the people who are owning it?</p>\n<p>SC: Okay, but as a startup this is the one piece of leverage you have. You don\u2019t have a lot of cash in the early days, and the one thing you can do \u2014</p>\n<p>Ben: Not necessarily true. I mean, if you can sell your stock, then you can have cash. If you can\u2019t, you\u2019re giving them valueless stock, potentially.</p>\n<p>SC: Okay, so then why not give people restricted stock units? Why not just give RSUs instead of options? Wouldn\u2019t that be sort of like a middle\u00e2\u0080\u00a6?</p>\n<p>Scott: You could do that, but it\u2019s just not as valuable, is the honest answer. An option has more value typically than an RSU. Early in the days people want to optimize for that option value. So you could certainly do that, you\u2019re right; you could give people RSUs early on and that would kind of change the dynamic. I think that would probably be a less attractive compensation measure for many employees relative to getting an equivalent number of options, because they\u2019re just not as highly valued in terms of how the mechanics actually work for an RSU.</p>\n<p>Ben: Right. When you\u2019re Google and your RSUs are equivalent to your stock price and your stock price is exceptionally high, then the RSUs become extremely valuable, but if you\u2019re a company that did a round at $15 million pre, and the RSUs are at the bottom of the preference stack, they\u2019re a lot less valuable. You\u2019d have to give less just because the option equivalent, the options have much more upside because you get more of them. So I think most employees who join a company and want ownership in that company would prefer options.</p>\n<p>RSUs are kind of closer to a cash instrument. You might think of them as a hybrid, but it\u2019s certainly a mechanism or tool in the toolbox. Again I think what you want to go back for is say, \u201cWho do I want to own the company? Who do I want to work here? What\u2019s fair compensation across the board for them? What does it mean to the people who stay with the company when a company leaves?\u201d</p>\n<p>One other tricky thing about the 10-year option vest \u2014 whether you want to stay or leave, whatever, I\u2019m not making a moral judgement on that, I\u2019m just saying \u2014 do you want a financial incentive for people to leave? If you have a 10-year exercise, there is potentially an incentive for people to leave in a sense that I can walk out with my stock that I have and I can get a brand new offer from a new company, whereas if I stay, maybe I get a promotional grant that\u2019s equivalent to a new offer of a new company, but that\u2019s a pretty rare thing.</p>\n<p>SC: The flip side of that is, then do you want someone who feels trapped as an employee, who can\u2019t necessarily move as easily because they\u2019re essentially, for lack of a better phrase, handcuffed to the company for X amount of time? So then I guess the question I\u2019m trying to get back to is this idea of adverse selection\u00e2\u0080\u00a6</p>\n<p>Ben: I think that\u2019s right, that if you have stock that you will get if you stay, but not get if you leave, then you have that issue as well, that you may be incentivized to stay even if you don\u2019t want to be there. You may have a financial incentive.</p>\n<p>SC: Right, then you actually become less like \u00e2\u0080\u009cdead equity\u00e2\u0080\u009d. You become like a dead zombie just hanging around the company, to be honest.</p>\n<p>Ben: No, absolutely. And look, we\u2019ve seen that behavior for sure.</p>\n<p>Scott: Yeah. No matter how you slice it, incentives do matter. So there\u2019s no question that if you incent people, whichever way you go to incent people, the behavior will follow. So certainly now with the 10-year option I think you do create an incentive, and that may be fine. That may be an incentive that you\u2019re okay with. If somebody\u2019s here for four years and they want to be mobile after that, that\u2019s okay, but I think you just have to recognize that you are creating that incentive and you have to be willing to understand the implications of that incentive you\u2019ve created.</p>\n<p>Ben: Right, and it may be something as simple as, \u201cOkay, dang, I don\u2019t want to incent people to leave after four years, but after six years I\u2019d be fine with that,\u201d and then you probably need to set your vesting schedule that way. These are just the issues that now become issues that weren\u2019t issues before we make this change.</p>\n<p>SC: Okay. Just to sum up then so far, it\u2019s very clear that, we all agree that the 90-day vesting schedule is broken. We also all agree that everyone \u2014 the founder, investors, the people building the company \u2014 everybody is pro-employee. I mean, the employees are the heart and blood of the business. They\u2019re the ones who create the value in the end.</p>\n<p>So where I think the disagreements are really playing out is in the nuances of how to approach the solution, and it sounds like we don\u2019t actually have a specific solution in mind. What we\u2019re really saying is it really depends on what you\u2019re optimizing for as a founder. So what are some of the broader principles and mindsets that we should then bring to this discussion if you are a founder trying to figure out the right way to go about this?</p>\n<p>Ben: Well, different companies are different. So you have to start with, okay, what do I want, and then what does what I do incent everybody who\u2019s applying for a job, everybody who has a job, and then whether or not they should leave that job. Then who do I want to own the company at the end of the day? I mean I don\u2019t know what the best answer is, and it\u2019s different depending on your ability to raise cash and other things as well.</p>\n<p>So it really probably needs to not be one size fits all. I think that if every company had a different scheme you do get into a weird thing for potential employees and recruiting. So I think we might do a disservice to the industry by doing that, but there might need to be, say, four or five standard flavors depending on how you think about your company, what kinds of employees you have, and we already do have very big differences in that, if you\u2019re a consumer internet company like WhatsApp, that\u2019s going to be very different than if you\u2019re a very complex hardware company like Tesla. Your ownership in Tesla as an employee is just going to be a different thing than it is going to be in WhatsApp.</p>\n<p>SC: We actually call it the \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhatsApp effect\u00e2\u0080\u009d here, that you can actually build that scale of a business with like 10 engineers.</p>\n<p>Ben: Yeah, for that business you can, but you can\u2019t build Tesla with 10 engineers. So these things matter as well. So Tesla\u2019s option plan cannot be the same as WhatsApp\u2019s, or it probably should not be.</p>\n<p>Scott: The other principle to think about \u2014 and people may differ on how they decide to implement it \u2014 is as best as you can, I think you do want to match the timing of how you think about people vesting their equity to as much as you can when liquidity happens in companies. And again remember, if you go back to where we started, it may just be now we might need to think about ownership and vesting periods differently, because you want to tie as much as you can the contribution of the employee to the overall creation of the actual equity value for the business.</p>\n<p>So maybe an answer is to think about, gee, people should get more options, even more options than they do today. But with the understanding that they vest over a longer period such that it ties more closely to when you think a liquidity happens, and then you don\u2019t have this issue of people leaving or not in terms of whether you need to change the actual exercise period, because you\u2019re trying to more formally match again vesting with when there actually is a liquid market into which people could actually vest and exercise and sell their shares.</p>\n<p>SC: So the overall theme is, there are plenty of different solutions that founders can have \u2014 and yes there are certain issues if not everyone standardizes, because while you can each experiment there becomes a sort of arbitrage between companies around their compensation and options package \u2014 but at the end of the day the real theme is to take a systemic approach to the problem and think about all the factors from not just a single employee, not just a founder, the large company you\u2019re building, the ecosystem you\u2019re living in, and not just have a simple solution without thinking through all the possible repercussions, and that seems to be the broader theme. And we actually in our own portfolio have a huge variety of how different people handle this. They have the freedom to do whatever they wish. So then why this rhetoric of this conversation being investor-anti-employee in the first place?</p>\n<p>Scott: It\u2019s really a question of, as Ben said, as a founder, what are the incentives you want. The only role that venture capitalists play in this, of course, is venture capitalists sit on boards of companies and they help the CEO kind of think about and manage option pools, but whether this happens or not is going to be driven by CEOs of companies, not venture capitalists, and there\u2019s nothing that the venture capitalists stand to gain in this context other than what Ben said, which is can we all think about what is the optimal structure to actually help create bigger and more valuable companies over time, and in that case I certainly think the venture capitalists are 100% aligned with the founders in that respect.</p>\n<p>Ben: Look, I have been an employee at a startup. I\u2019ve lost options over the 90-day exercise window that I couldn\u2019t afford, I really couldn\u2019t afford. I\u2019ve got three kids and I\u2019m 26 years old, and all that kind of thing. So I understand the issue on that end as well. But I think what we\u2019re really talking about here is how do you build a great company. None of these options are worth anything if the company fails. So the design of the option plan to make the company successful is every bit as important to the employees as it is for the employees to actually get their fair pay for their fair work. So you can\u2019t divorce those two topics.</p>\n<p>Sonal: The other important idea we haven\u2019t talked about, and if <a href=\"https://a16z.com/author/shannon-callahan/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Shannon</a> were in this room with us (our head of the People and Practices group, but she\u2019s on maternity leave) \u2014 I think the thing that she would say, and this is the most important thread that I\u2019ve seen come up in posts like Adam D\u00e2\u0080\u0099Angelo\u2019s and other conversations \u2014 is communicating in a very transparent way to employees early on what they\u2019re getting into so that they know exactly what the tradeoffs are depending on the model.</p>\n<p>Ben: Yeah, I think that was probably the biggest sin of the 90-day exercise era, is that a tiny number of employees actually understood that that was the case. I know I didn\u2019t understand when I was an employee. It is in your agreement, but half of the language in a stock option agreement if you\u2019re a young kid who wasn\u2019t trained in this kind of thing was, like what is an exercise period? I thought that was like some kind of aerobics or something.</p>\n<p>SC: Yeah. In fact Shannon often says they have this myth that if you work at a startup you\u2019re going to become a millionaire, and that\u2019s actually not always the case.</p>\n<p>Ben: Yeah, it\u2019s not often the case. I think that\u2019s a big thing, educating people on what their compensation package means. If you actually did that and it was actually transparent, then you might learn something as well about what an employee would really prefer, and maybe it is longer exercise times and many more stock options, or maybe it\u2019s more cash or maybe it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s who knows\u00e2\u0080\u00a6</p>\n<p>SC: It\u2019s a two-way learning because, if the whole point of this conversation is that as the founder you\u2019re incentivizing for what you\u2019re valuing, then that employee hears that in that conversation as well in that discussion of that plan.</p>\n<p>Ben: Oh, absolutely. I think personal situations have a lot to do with how you think about compensation, whether you\u2019re committed to the long-term success of the company and that is your mission or not, if you\u2019ve got one living situation. I\u2019ve hired people who are rich who have no commitment to the company who want all their compensation in stock, and then I\u2019ve hired people who are totally committed who need cash to be a bigger component, and so I think it\u2019s important to recognize that. Not everything is in the payment instrument.</p>\n<p>SC: One of the most valuable points that Adam D\u00e2\u0080\u0099Angelo makes, is that every company should have the choice to set up their own plan. And you guys are all saying the same thing actually; it should be something that you think through as a founder. You shouldn\u2019t be sticking to a standard that\u2019s sort of a relic of old times. But I do wonder, Ben, what would you do differently if you were the CEO of a company today?</p>\n<p>Ben: If I was doing it now \u2014 and this is for a company that I would run, so this is not necessarily what anybody should do for their company or anybody needs to do for a company we invest in, and I want to make that clear \u2014 the things that I would likely do differently given what\u2019s changed is one, I think I would give bigger stock option packages. I think I would correspondingly have the length of the kind of vesting period be longer. I would have it be more back-end loaded.</p>\n<p>SC: What do you mean by back-end loaded?</p>\n<p>Ben: Back-end loaded meaning similar to Snapchat. So maybe rather than vesting in a four year context, 25, 25, 25, 25, it might be a five year context that was more whatever, like 10, 10, 10, 20, 50 or something. I haven\u2019t designed it or anything. Then I think that once you do that, I think a 10 year exercise probably works or some kind of castle equivalent payout so that people do get paid if they vest their stock, and then I would absolutely train all managers how to explain this correctly to employees.</p>\n<p>SC: So there\u2019s more transparency.</p>\n<p>Ben: When they came in, yes, because I think that\u2019s a very, very big deal. And I think, look, by back-end loading it you can give larger stock option\u2026</p>\n<p>I want to say I\u2019m not giving larger stock option packages because I\u2019m the most generous person in the world. That\u2019s not really how it works. The way it works is everything you give out dilutes everybody else who\u2019s there. So there is no free lunch in that sense. What I\u2019m saying is because the vesting is back-end loaded and the stock is going to go disproportionately to the people who stay longer, I can then afford to give out bigger packages because the people who leave after a year are not gonna walk away with that much stock. They\u2019re gonna walk away with 10% of what they got.</p>\n<p>SC: Okay, so two really important themes that came up for me in the nuances of this conversation that I think are lost in the current dialogue\u2026Actually the CEO of Quora (I forgot to actually say who he was!) \u2014 Adam D\u00e2\u0080\u0099Angelo, has written about this in the past, and Ben, you actually called out his work in <a href=\"https://a16z.com/2014/11/13/one-management-concept/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">a class</a> you taught at Stanford, in Sam Altman\u2019s How To Do A Startup class about two years ago, which I\u2019ll link to in the blurb for this podcast if people want to chase down all these links \u2014 but I think the broader question is experimentation, that it\u2019s time to now experiment with new models, because it\u2019s very clear we don\u2019t have, as you\u2019re saying, depending on what you\u2019re optimizing for, one clear standard model.</p>\n<p>So one of the experiments is a 10-year vest. Another experiment is Andrew Mason\u2019s idea around progressive equity, which we actually talked about with him on the podcast.</p>\n<p>Ben: Yes, is probably the most radical \u2014 which again has nothing to do with investors \u2014 but in Andrew\u2019s model he basically puts a kind of cap on what the CEO, the founders, and executives can make, and it\u2019s a dollar cap, and once they hit their dollar cap which is whatever their financial independence threshold is, and I think it was $50 million or something like that at his company, then all the rest of their ownership kind of goes into an employee pool. So it helps to, a little bit, spread the wealth, but the idea is just more like what does it mean to whom and what\u2019s fair. And I think these are really complicated equations in general, but I thought that was certainly an interesting innovation.</p>\n<p>One of our CEOs has been talking about, would employees rather just have the one thing they don\u2019t get, which is liquidation preference? \u2014 would they rather have the liquidation preference value than the option value, which is essentially the same as saying would they just rather be compensated in cash. I think there are definitely employees that would prefer that and there are employees that would prefer not to have that, and I think another thing that affects it is just how expensive things are in Silicon Valley these days. So rent has gone up, has doubled in San Francisco in the last four years; that changes your attitude about how you want to be compensated. So we\u2019ve not taken that into account either.</p>\n<p>Scott: A rather interesting thing to think about is what Eric Ries has been talking about, which is this concept of a long-term stock exchange. The reason it\u2019s relevant in this context is one of the things that Eric does talk about is aligning incentives between investors and managers of the company, and one of the ways he proposes to do that is to have longer vesting periods, to have compensation programs that are much more tied toward long-term goals for the company as opposed to things today that are tied to relatively short-term goals like what quarterly results look like. And in return obviously he\u2019s expecting investors also to take a longer-term view towards managing the company. But it goes to the broader point we talked about earlier, which is if you want to build a big company one of the things to think about is how do you align compensation such that you\u2019re ultimately trying to incent building a big company over a long period of time.</p>\n<p>SC: All right, you guys. Really interesting discussion. It\u2019s the beginning of many conversations because I think we are aiming to start, not end, the conversation with a definitive solution\u2026 Well, thank you for joining the a16z Podcast.</p>\n<p>Ben: All right.

It\u2019s a cross-game avatar platform for the metaverse. The metaverse is not one place, or one app, or one game, it\u2019s a network of thousands of different worlds. So it makes sense for users to have an avatar that travels with them across many different virtual worlds. And that\u2019s what we give to the kind of users of the metaverse. And from a developer\u2019s point of view, when you\u2019re building a virtual world or game, you have to build an avatar system or character system for a game. And we solve that problem and give them a character system they can integrate in a few days. And we work with like 3,000 different companies that are using our avatars across many applications in the metaverse.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Jon:</strong> Let\u2019s talk about LA for a bit. So David, you spent most of your professional career here in LA and you\u2019re also a Dodgers fan, I see.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>David:</strong> We\u2019re actually going to the game tonight as a team. So, we\u2019ll squeeze that in somehow.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Jon:</strong> That\u2019s awesome. So, you\u2019ve worked at Riot Games, you\u2019ve worked at Bird, you attended UCLA. And Timmu, you have many, many partners at Ready Player Me that are based here in LA. Maybe talk a bit about how you\u2019ve seen the startup environment for LA, specifically, for game developers and metaverse builders evolve over the last couple of years?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>David:</strong> Sure. I moved to LA for Riot in 2008. Activision was here and Blizzard was down South and there really wasn\u2019t a lot of a landscape here at first and attracting. Of course, you have Hollywood and all the creative talent here. But for engineering, and game engineering, and back-end engineering, we were pulling in people from all over the place, all over the country, all over the world to come and work here in LA. And it\u2019s evolved so much since then, I think Riot is a huge LA success story. Look at something like, you know, other companies like Snap are huge stories. And now there\u2019s, games alone, you know this number better than I, probably 20-plus games startups in LA alone. So, it\u2019s changed a lot.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Timmu:</strong> Yeah. I was actually based in LA, like, five years ago for a year. I went to LA Tech Week five years ago. It was a lot different. So, it\u2019s definitely been a great development. And we have partners here, a lot of creative minds here. Both the kind of metaverse, the creative part of the metaverse, and Web3 comes from LA. So it\u2019s definitely good to see how it\u2019s changed.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Jon:</strong> And why do you think there are so many game developers here in LA? Like, what are the pros and cons of being a game developer here versus another city?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>David:</strong> It\u2019s a hub, it\u2019s a center, right? You can come here, you can find the job of your dreams, you can find the exact game, or company, or role that you\u2019re looking for here because there are so many opportunities. And so, I think it just sort of builds upon it, it becomes a snowball and just sort of builds on itself. That\u2019s great. I think there\u2019s a lot of opportunities here. I think folks like a16z have identified that and have really come in and helped nourish the environment, and that\u2019s been helpful as well.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Jon:</strong> Let\u2019s shift gears a bit and talk about a topic that I think has been the subject of a lot of debate and potentially controversy recently, which is the metaverse. So, as a game developer, as a platform developer, what is your view with the metaverse? What is it? How close are we to it?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>David:</strong> Jon always says my answer is a very Web2 answer. I don\u2019t know whether to be insulted by that or not. But we\u2019ll figure that out later. But I feel like\u2026I\u2019m a lifelong gamer. I\u2019ve been playing games forever. And as a gamer, I\u2019ve always used gaming platforms and tools like VENT or even now Discord, to gather with my friends and interact. And, sort of, gaming has always been the excuse. But now there\u2019s so much more for us to do in games, we can not only play games, but we can watch our favorite sports, we can listen to music, we can go to concerts. Like, we\u2019re already doing all of these things, but they\u2019re really geared around hardcore gamers. And I think that the folks who are looking in from the outside and they\u2019re seeing all this stuff going on, without being controversial, I feel like they\u2019re trying to give what they\u2019re seeing a name. And I always say, \u201cOh, they\u2019ve labeled it the metaverse,\u201d right? And I do think that there\u2019s potential to broaden that audience for creating experiences and excitement for people who aren\u2019t the 1000-hour gamers like myself.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Timmu:</strong> Yeah. For one side, the metaverse is here. 2 billion people are playing games every year. We\u2019re looking at what, like 10 to 15-year-olds do, they spend a lot of time in Roblox, and Fortnite, and Minecraft. A lot of their social interactions they have with their friends are actually in the metaverse, so in a virtual world already. And those kids grow up and they will start using products with avatars maybe for work and then so forth. That\u2019s the behavior \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the fact that people spend a lot of time in virtual is already here. What\u2019s missing, from our point of view, is all those worlds are closed ecosystems, all those worlds are separated, closed, walled gardens that don\u2019t exist together. The metaverse is not one game, it\u2019s a network of thousands of different virtual worlds and games and so forth.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Jon:</strong> What you\u2019re referring to is that if you play Minecraft, that you can\u2019t pick any of your items over to another game like Fortnite or Roblox, and so on.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Timmu:</strong> Exactly. Like if you play several games, you have a different avatar for each game, you have different economy in each game, you can\u2019t transfer between them. So it\u2019s not a connective metaverse. And for the real metaverse to happen, there needs to be cross-game services and protocols and standards that link those worlds together. And avatars are a major part of that, that\u2019s why we\u2019re working on avatars. Anyone should be able to play an avatar within the cross-worlds. And that helps connect the metaverse a little bit more and push it to\u00c2\u00a0 the open metaverse centers.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Jon:</strong> What, in your view, are some of the benefits that you get from breaking down these walled gardens and enabling interoperability that we don\u2019t see today? Since as you mentioned, we only have 3 billion gamers, it feels like they\u2019re very happy playing Fortnite, Roblox, Minecraft, the games of today. What is it that\u2019s missing that could be improved with interoperability?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Timmu:</strong> Very broadly, there are two paths to the future of the metaverse. One is a closed metaverse which is owned by one company or a few companies that make all the rules. And the other is an open metaverse, which is built by millions of different creators that are all collaborating, the worlds are interlinked, and everybody can take part and nobody controls the metaverse, nobody makes the rules. And it\u2019s partly or mostly owned by the creators and the builders of those things, or it is owned by the builder.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Anyways, the open metaverse is a better future for all of us here. The metaverse is powerful, we\u2019re going to spend a lot of time in it. So we don\u2019t want it to be controlled by one company. For the open metaverse to exist, there need to be cross-game services, interoperability, each be able to transfer items between games. And that really builds the ground for open metaverse to exist. And just practically, would you want to have a thousand different avatars for a thousand different games? You just want to have one identity, it\u2019s consistent across worlds? And also, as a developer, when you sell skins and outdoor accessories, for example, do users want to buy something that is stuck in one game or travels across the metaverse?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Jon:</strong> It\u2019s more valuable.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Timmu:</strong> Exactly. And stays where you can use it throughout your metaverse lifecycle.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Jon:</strong> David, what\u2019s your reaction to that?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>David:</strong> I will step aside from my engineering roots and wonder about all the technical hurdles between here and there. My question is really: standards. You\u2019ve talked about shared services and things like that. You need the protocols, you need standards, and how do those get established and agreed upon? How do you imagine that being a community-driven effort or how does that get solved?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Timmu:</strong> We already have three dozen companies we work with who use our avatars. And all of them are using different standards. Like, they use a different platform. They use a different rate. And we just work around it and offer it in whatever spec that the developer needs. So, that\u2019s how we make the interoperability happen as a centralized party essentially, today.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">I think for the industry to figure out standards and protocols, it needs to be clear that an interoperable economy or interoperable systems for a better user experience and better business model. And for that to happen, some kind of a proto-metaverse needs to exist and show everyone that it builds a bigger economy and there\u2019s a better way to build games. And then, there\u2019s motivation for people to figure out the standards and protocols and agree on them. Right now it\u2019s just a concept. And you can work around it, but it\u2019s not going to tip the entire industry overnight.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>David:</strong> If you had a bet, do you think you end up with the sort of closed-world metaverse or sort of an open metaverse?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Timmu:</strong> I think there\u2019ll be a little bit of a mix. So there will be definitely platforms that they want to build a closed world and then can build a closed world. And then there will be a big part of open metaverses as well that exist side by side.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Jon:</strong> Awesome. And it\u2019s interesting that one of the thesis that we have is that games are next-generation social networks. That kids that are growing up today, they\u2019re largely not on Facebook, they\u2019re not on Snapchat, they\u2019re spending all their time in these virtual worlds that these gentlemen are building. And then if you continue advancing that sort of social network thesis, we\u2019ll also notice that there are several social networks that exist today that are large and very successful. Like, we have Snapchat, we have Instagram, we have Facebook, we have LinkedIn, we have Discord. And so there\u2019s no one-winner-take-all social network. And it\u2019s interesting to think that games might evolve similarly, where you also have kids that are going between Minecraft, and Roblox, and Fortnite, and League of Legends, and they are all very healthy social communities that you might find different social graphs within each one.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Let me change tactics and talk about, there are two technologies that many people associate with the metaverse. I think the first is VR, virtual reality, and then the second is Web3, which we touched on a little bit with interoperability. Maybe let\u2019s start with VR first. An interesting factor that I\u2019m very excited about is that Meta recently announced that the Oculus Quest 2 had shipped 15 million units since launch in Q4 2020. This is actually more than the number of Xboxes, I think the last generation of Xboxes that have been shipped. It\u2019s a notable milestone. What\u2019s your reaction to that, and sort of what\u2019s your stance on the future of VR going forward from there?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>David:</strong> VR is so difficult for me, because it\u2019s a platform that today I can\u2019t use. I\u2019m one of the few people who get super-nauseous. But I think once the technology allows everyone to participate\u2026</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Timmu:</strong> Hardware improvements.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>David:</strong> Yeah, hardware improvements, also cost, as a barrier to entry. I think you can really start to talk about real permeation in the marketplace.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Timmu:</strong> Yeah. I mean, VR was the reason we kind of started putting out just nine years ago\u2026\u00c2\u00a0 but it took a lot longer to get here. As a company, we\u2019re not making a bet on VR, I think it will be a part of metaverse. The more people will have interesting experiences, the more developed and we\u2019ll figure out. So, just that kind of a tailwind for the metaverse generally, but it\u2019s not like the core part, it\u2019s not gonna be a core part of the metaverse for a bit of time.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Jon:</strong> And one of the challenges for VR app developers is the requirement, since you\u2019re in a 3D space, that you need to have an avatar. In general, it\u2019s much more difficult to build a 3D avatar than a 2D one and so on and so forth.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Timmu:</strong> Exactly. It is. So, we have a lot of VR companies who use our avatars. And in VR, it\u2019s like, when you\u2019re speaking with an avatar, it\u2019s like very much in your face. It really matters. Like, if it\u2019s a bad avatar, it\u2019s a terrible experience. And VR, it doesn\u2019t matter: that\u2019s who you are and that\u2019s who your friends are when you speak with them.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Jon:</strong> Yeah. Just maybe zooming up one level to talk about avatars in general, there\u2019s been a trend of VTubing, right, where you have VTubers streaming and creating videos using an avatar instead of their real-life selves. This is happening on Twitch as well. Do you feel that the trend that people representing themselves publicly using the avatars over their real-life selves will continue?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Timmu:</strong> Yeah, for sure. I mean, avatars lower the barrier of upgrading content because you don\u2019t have to put your identity out there, you just have this avatar representation. It can look like you, it doesn\u2019t have to look like you, and you can create content with it, you can represent yourself as an avatar. And as the technology improves, as there\u2019s more better tracking solutions and easier tracking solutions, I think that they\u2019ll only continue evolving. And also, when you can use your avatar for streaming, you can actually use it in games, you can use it on social media \u00e2\u0080\u0094 it becomes consistent across your entire virtual experience.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Jon:</strong> It\u2019s also very powerful. It\u2019s something that we see in games often. Your idealized self can sometimes be represented better digitally than your life, right? You can be anyone that you want in the metaverse, in a video game, and so on.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Timmu:</strong> Yeah.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Jon:</strong> Yeah. Last topic is Web3, which, I know, has also been controversial. There have been many gamers that have had sort of an allergic reaction to NFTs. Like Minecraft recently announced that they were actually banning NFTs from that platform. Is there something that you think players are misunderstanding here, are you sympathetic to that? What\u2019s your reaction?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>David:</strong> I don\u2019t think players are missing anything. I think it\u2019s developers who are missing something. I think that players, especially hardcore gamers, have been doing a lot of things that, not all, but a lot of things that NFTs are being marketed as to a player, right? \u201cHey, we\u2019ve now put our game on top of blockchain. And now you\u2019re able to trade, now you\u2019re able to own, now you\u2019re able to accrue value,\u201d etc. I played some CS:GO. I\u2019ve played some Val. I\u2019ve definitely gone on some shady black-market websites and bought new accounts. Sorry, if anyone\u2019s from Blizzard. And these things have existed, but they\u2019re not safe, and they\u2019re not secure, and they\u2019re not repeatable. And there\u2019s value there for players that they\u2019ve interacted with. But I think that when the UX looks very crypto on the surface, \u201cHere\u2019s my wallet, I gotta sign in. I gotta exchange for currency,\u201d it\u2019s off-putting. And I think that players will go to anywhere where there\u2019s true player value, right?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">And I think that the blockchain probably is a brilliant technology that provides a lot of capabilities that players currently value, right? But I think that there\u2019s a lot of folks in the Web3 space who are creating a UX. And you don\u2019t know that\u2019s what you\u2019re doing. I think that\u2019s a brilliant approach, right? I think, as a gamer, if I put my game on the chain, or, you know, I really target Web3 as a core to my product, I want players to discover that as they unwrap the onion, right? You should be able to sign in just like any free-to-play game, you should start to play, you should start to earn. And then you can discover these things, right? I think that\u2019s the key.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Timmu:</strong> Yeah. I think people hate the concept of NFTs, not what they provide, the ownership. So, it\u2019s like the speculation and stuff like that gamers receive from the site versus what\u2019s going on in the market. And that\u2019s kind of like what people are hating, not the ownership it provides. And as more applications come out, that just really use the value of NFTs, and also like cross-game, add to those. Because yeah, you can own an asset in one game but then NFTs and blockchain really helps separate the ownership for a particular game and make it usable across many worlds. And it\u2019s just another reality today. When those things happen, then it\u2019s more kind of an obvious, divided agreement.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Jon:</strong> It\u2019s very clear that we\u2019re still in the early innings of Web3, and a lot of the promise of it is going to be ultimately carried out by builders like yourselves that are building at the frontier. And with that, I think we\u2019re actually out of time. So, thank you, David and Timmu for discussing the future of games with us.</span></p>\n<div class=\"wp-content\">\n<p style=\"text-align: center\">***</p>\n<p><i>The above transcript is abridged and edited for clarity.</i></p>\n<p><i>The views expressed here are those of the individual AH Capital Management, L.L.C.

I\u2019m Michael Copeland and we have with us today both A and Z, Marc Andreessen and Ben Horowitz. Welcome, guys.</p>\n<p>Marc: Hey.</p>\n<p>Ben: All right. Thank you, Michael.</p>\n<p>Michael: Right about now it\u2019s been five years since the firm was founded, since you guys founded the firm. We thought it was a good time not to look back so much, but to sort of take stock and talk about some tech trends that you\u2019re seeing now and then spin things forward. So, one of the pillars that this firm really rests itself on is \u201csoftware eats the world.\u201d And Marc, just to refresh us, we use it as shorthand around here, but what is the thesis? Explain a little bit and then let\u2019s get into where we are in that thesis.</p>\n<p>Marc: So, yeah, the thesis is that the computer itself is only about 75 years old, right? The computer was originally invented to crack codes during World War II, and then got adopted by governments and big businesses in the \u201960s and \u201970s. And then the PC arrived and then rich people in the developed world, US, Europe, were able to get PCs in the \u201980s and \u201990s. Leading up to basically about five years ago, you lived in a world in which maybe a billion, billion and a half people had PCs. And then some of those PCs were on the Internet. And then at some point all those PCs finally got on the Internet. That\u2019s all fine and good, but that sort of meant that most people in the world didn\u2019t have access to computers and most of the people in the world weren\u2019t on the Internet up until a few years ago.</p>\n<p>And then starting in 2007, with the iPhone, the smartphone comes out. The smartphone finally packages computers in a form where everybody on the planet can have one. And this is the thing I\u2019ve been talking a lot about that people occasionally get angry about, because they think it won\u2019t possibly come true, but I\u2019m convinced it\u2019s going to come true, which is I think everybody on the planet by the end of the decade is going to have a smartphone. Effectively everybody. Almost everybody. Including in places where it\u2019s still hard to get electricity or water, people are going to have smartphones. In fact, the big thing this year is the rise of the $35 smartphone in countries like India and Pakistan that are just exploding in just giant volume.</p>\n<p>So, I think we\u2019re going to live in a world by the end of the decade in which there\u2019s five, six, seven billion smartphones in people\u2019s hands, which means five, six, seven billion people in the world connected to the Internet with what we would consider modern tools and technologies and access. And so, that\u2019s a world we\u2019ve never lived in, right? That\u2019s a world where everybody\u2019s connected. That\u2019s a world where everybody has access to the technology that we take for granted today. So in that world, you can start to think\u2026 I think you can think very profound thoughts about\u2026 like what happens in many different fields and businesses and industries as a consequence of that?</p>\n<p>So, what happens in the media business is an example \u00e2\u0080\u0093 what happens when everybody has the ability to consume news online? What happens in the TV business, when everybody has the ability to get video streams straight to their cellphone? What happens to retail when everybody can engage in e-commerce? What happens to education when everybody can take classes online through their smartphone? And so, I think the next five years is basically prime time to think about every business, every industry, every field and say, \u201cWell, how can we reinvent it now knowing that software can basically play such an important role in everything.\u201d</p>\n<p>Michael: So, where are we? And what are you guys seeing in terms of the verticals that are being eaten? And then I want to get at what it\u2019s like to be eaten, too. But what are the verticals that sort of\u2026 \u201cfallen\u201d is the wrong word, but fell first to \u201csoftware eats the world\u201d and what comes next?</p>\n<p>Marc: Well, I would characterize it as building. We tend to be glass-half-full people. We think there\u2019s huge opportunities that flow from this. Media\u2019s been an obvious one. Financial services, software\u2019s taking over at a very fast pace. And then retail, e-commerce has been a profound revolution over the last 10 years and that will continue. I think the three big ones that we think of a lot about for the next five or 10 years are\u2026 and they\u2019re really, really big domains. These are long-term projects, but healthcare, education and then ultimately government.</p>\n<p>Michael: So, those three that you mentioned have been the most intractable, it seems, and we\u2019ve been promised\u2026 there\u2019s electronic medical records. Obama\u2019s got a great website, but that\u2019s not software eating government. Like why now, and what makes it different?</p>\n<p>Marc: Why now? Because you can. Because it\u2019s possible. Because it can be done. Because everybody\u2019s going to have a smartphone. Because everybody\u2019s going to have to be online. These are very, very big fields. Very big entrenched interests. Lots of regulation. Like there\u2019s nothing easy about it. But because they\u2019re so big also makes them so important, right? So, I\u2019ll just give you my perspective, which is healthcare and education, one of the things you always look at is you\u2019re like, \u201cWell, healthcare and education is something that you want everybody on the planet to have access to.\u201d</p>\n<p>Michael Copeland: Right.</p>\n<p>Marc: But at the same time, if you just try to do that with conventional ways of delivering those services, you\u2019ll bankrupt everything, right? You look at the US fiscal situation over the next 50 years and you look at this massive debt. A very large amount of it is geared towards healthcare, paying for people\u2019s healthcare. And a lot of it then is geared towards education and this huge crisis we have around things like student loan debt. And so, healthcare and education suffer from something that economists call \u201cBaumol\u2019s cost disease\u201d after an economist named Baumol. And the cost disease basically is technology steadily drives down prices in sectors like media and in financial services.<br/>\nBut technology is not yet driving down costs in healthcare and education but it should. And so, if you can bring revolutionary technology into those fields, you could basically break the back of the so-called \u201ccost disease.\u201d And then you can bring the same cost reduction you see in other fields into those fields, which then means you can really open up access. And that\u2019s the critical thing. We need to get every kid on the planet access to what we consider today to be a top-end Ivy League education. We need to get every person on the planet to have access to what we would consider to be a modern healthcare capability. The only way to do that is to apply technology. Otherwise, you\u2019d bankrupt the planet trying to do it with the current techniques.</p>\n<p>Michael: Ben, I want to bring you into the conversation. \u201cSoftware eats the world\u201d is great if you\u2019re on the side of the coding keyboard where you\u2019re out there and you feel empowered to go after healthcare or government or whatever else it is. But what if you\u2019re on the other side, and you\u2019re being eaten. How do you view that, and then how do we bring those folks along?</p>\n<p>Ben: Well, I think in the first place, the misunderstanding of it is that those jobs get eaten and there are just fewer jobs. I think the history of the country, and the history of the world, has been the jobs 50 years from now are not going to be the same jobs that we\u2019re doing today, although we had a very long time when most of the jobs were farming. And thankfully, most of the jobs are no longer farming, because farming is hard work.</p>\n<p>Michael: Yes.</p>\n<p>Ben: But most of the jobs today aren\u2019t jobs that were around before. I mean, there were all kinds of jobs, like for example delivering ice was a big job. Making vinyl records used to be an important job. There were a lot of jobs that are no longer here. So the challenge isn\u2019t the absolute number of jobs, but rather the transition from one set of jobs to another. And this is where I think I would just add to what Marc is saying that, like it\u2019s really important to apply technology to bring down the cost of things so that you can make policy decisions to create both a safety net and education system that enables people to not starve to death or hit the streets or become homeless or really lose their dignity in the meanwhile, but then also be in position where they can go be productive again as quickly as possible. And that thing is not really affordable if all the money is going to \u201ctechnology un-enabled\u201d education and health care.</p>\n<p>Michael: Right.</p>\n<p>Ben: And so they kind of go together. I think that if software doesn\u2019t eat the things that the government pays for, then we run into trouble. And you could imagine completely government funded awesome education enabled by things like Oculus, where you could put kids from anywhere in the very best classrooms in the world as though they were actually there.</p>\n<p>Michael: Oculus, to be clear, virtual reality goggles would allow you to do what?</p>\n<p>Ben: Well, basically, enter a virtual classroom with virtual other kids and virtual teacher, which might not sound that great if you\u2019re at Harvard, but it sounds awfully good if you\u2019re in an innercity school that\u2019s very dangerous to go to with teachers that maybe no longer that interested in teaching for all kinds of reasons. And so by applying technology to the things that cost most, you can both improve the services and reduce the cost a lot, which also frees up money for things like a really robust social safety net, which basically gets you and you ought to be\u2026 in 2014, we ought to be at the point where everybody can get basic shelter, transportation, education and other services without bankrupting the country.</p>\n<p>Michael: Does that social safety net come from private industry, via taxes? I mean, is it government run? Who pays for it?</p>\n<p>Ben: Yes. I think the social safety net, ideally the money would come from the government and would come from taxes. And I think it would be smart as a taxpayer to do that. But it only works if there\u2019s real technology behind it. Because otherwise\u2026 right now we can\u2019t even afford healthcare. And so without the application of technology, we\u2019re in this halfway point where software is eating lots of jobs or transitioning lots of jobs. But yet the big government services have not yet been transformed.</p>\n<p>Michael: I see. We talk about this transition point. Marc, you mentioned billions of cellphones in people\u2019s hands, or smartphones, I should say. Computers essentially in people\u2019s hands. What is our evidence that we\u2019re at this transition point. I want to talk a little bit about accelerating innovation in your careers, how the present looks different than maybe it did in the mid, late \u201990s or early 2000s even?</p>\n<p>Marc: Yeah. Well, things look really, really different. So, there\u2019s sort of this running thing in the Valley that, like it\u2019s another bubble. People have been calling it another bubble now. This is year 10 and people are calling it a new bubble. It started in 2005, so maybe at some point they\u2019ll be right. This thing is like this is the \u201990s all over again? The thing that has changed so much is the industry and the world are so much further along than they were in the \u201990s. We built Netscape the company. We were out there doing it in the \u201990s. We built Netscape. We had at one point over 90% market share for all people on the Internet using our browser. And it turned out there were 50 million people on the Internet. 50 million people around the world were on the Internet.</p>\n<p>By the way, 25 million of them were on AOL, so to say that they were on the Internet would be a slightly generous statement. The other 25 million were directly online but that was it. You could have 90% market share and you\u2019d have less than 50 million users. And that was it. That was all that we could do. By the way, those 50 million people were all coming in, for the most part, over dial-up. So they\u2019re coming in very slow. They\u2019re making new TV shows in which the period in which you had these old PCs, they now look retro.</p>\n<p>Times have changed in a freaking hurry. And so the technology world was a much smaller place and the number of people who had access to technology was just a much smaller place. Fast-forward to today. More than 2 billion people online, rising very fast. So, market expansion. We think about things in terms of market sizes, market expansion on the order of 40, 50, 60-fold over the course of 15 years, which is just absolutely amazing. Which is why you have these companies like Google and Facebook now that have more than a billion users.</p>\n<p>Michael: Right.</p>\n<p>Marc: I like to work with Mark Zuckerberg at Facebook, and I like to tease him with like what a special position Facebook is in, because Facebook passed a billion users a year or two ago. And it\u2019s like, how many businesses or human organizations or institutions in history have ever had a billion anything? And it\u2019s like\u2026 it\u2019s basically the Catholic Church and the Coca-Cola company. And that\u2019s basically been it.</p>\n<p>Marc: And then like Google and Facebook are number two and three\u2026 three and four. And then WhatsApp is going to do it. And then there\u2019s going to be a whole bunch of others. iPhone is going to do it, and Android is going to do it. And so the world has really opened up and expanded very fast.</p>\n<p>Michael: We invest in all kinds of things here. Software based mostly, but drones, BitCoin, 3D, virtual reality, Oculus. How do you guys keep up? If things are different and the pace is different, how do you guys personally keep up? And then how should the rest of us think about keeping up, if even that\u2019s the right thing to think about?</p>\n<p>Ben: Well, I think it\u2019s like a lot of things that are extremely complex if you don\u2019t have some unification understanding of what\u2019s going on then it does get very complicated. But one of the tenets when we started the firm was we were only going to invest in things that we understood. And that meant things where software was a core intellectual property. And if you look at what\u2019s happening across all of those things, they\u2019re different manifestations of software becoming a more powerful force in the world due to all the things that Marc talked about. The improvement in the underlying platforms. The improvement in the programming languages and connectivity and all these things.</p>\n<p>And so whether it\u2019s software eating money or software eating entertainment, it\u2019s all comes from the core root phenomenon. And so these things are relatively easy to understand quickly. Now some of them\u2026 the details of every one of them is complex, but the nice thing is it\u2019s our favorite thing to do in the world, so it\u2019s a great job in that way.</p>\n<p>Michael: We\u2019ve talk about software eating certain industries? One could imagine mostly software based or digital-based industries. But it\u2019s moving into the physical world. Where do you see that most starkly and does it look different as software eats manufacturing, robotics, et cetera?</p>\n<p>Marc: Yes. Basically, I think the key assumption I make is every physical thing is going to become smart over the next 10 or 20 years. This one\u2019s going to take time, but it will happen. So basically every physical thing, whether it\u2019s a toy or a light bulb or a doorknob or a building or your desk or whatever \u2014 take your pick, your car. They\u2019re all going to become smart. By smart, I mean they\u2019re all going to have chips built into them. Everything is going to have a chip in it.</p>\n<p>Everything is going to be on the Internet. Everything\u2019s going to be connected. Everything is going to have data. Everything is going to be responsive to human beings. And by the way, I mean like everything. One of the most\u2026 a very exciting trend that we\u2019re not yet invested in, but I\u2019m very excited about is I think\u2026 I\u2019m convinced in the future pills are all going to have chips in them. So for example, like every pill you take is going to have a biodegradable chip in it.</p>\n<p>Michael: We\u2019ve been talking about \u201csmart refrigerators\u201d for a long time. Why do I want my refrigerator to be smart?</p>\n<p>Marc: Because you want your refrigerator to know, for example, when the food in it has spoiled so that you don\u2019t get salmonella. Very fundamental. You might like to know\u2026 you\u2019re at the grocery store, you might like to know what you\u2019ve actually got, what you actually need to re-order. And it\u2019s just been the nature\u2026 the criticism of this stuff is always so interesting, because basically these products come out and they\u2019re basically experiments. So people basically try different kinds of things. Some of them work and some of them don\u2019t.</p>\n<p>And there\u2019s always this criticism of like, \u201cOh, the designers of these products didn\u2019t think everything through,\u201d as if there\u2019s some magic process where you can send a bunch of geniuses off to a remote island and they could design everything perfectly and then build it right the first time. But that never happens. What ends up happening there are tons and tons and tons of experiments, right? Out of which you finally then get the things that are going to go broad.</p>\n<p>And so, people experimented with how to bring computers to consumers for 10 years before the IBM PC went broad. People experimented. The smartphone concept is not new. It goes back to 1997. It took 10 years to get to the iPhone\u2026 to the actual product people want. The Internet was in existence for 30 years before we made the web browser and finally figured out how to make the Internet accessible to everybody. So that\u2019s why I say this part of it\u2026 sort of \u201cInternet of things\u201d concept or making the real world smart is a long-term thing. It doesn\u2019t just instantaneously happen. But it will happen. And it will happen through the process and experimentation that we see happening right now.</p>\n<p>Michael: Let\u2019s switch gears a little bit. You guys started the firm now five years ago in the teeth of the worst recession since the Depression. Is that fair to say?</p>\n<p>Marc: It was the worst economic crisis for venture capital in 40 years is what everybody told us.</p>\n<p>Ben Yeah, that\u2019s what they said.</p>\n<p>Michael: So it seemed like a good idea at the time. And turns out it was. The venture capital industry has been shrinking ever since. So, describe for us where we are in the VC industry. And then I want to get at how building companies and venture capital relate to each other today and as you see it going forward.</p>\n<p>Ben: Yes. The shrinking in the number of the firms has really been a wonderful thing and very healthy for both the industry and very good for entrepreneurs. One of the aspects of venture capital that bothered us a great deal when we started the firm was that it was an industry that really was in the dark. And what I mean by \u201cin the dark,\u201d it was completely invisible to what was going on, what was behind these firms and so forth. And like anything that\u2019s in the dark, that\u2019s where the nasty business happens in terms of everything from kind of bad things growing in it to ethics and everything.</p>\n<p>Whereas things in the sunlight, that\u2019s when everybody behaves and is at their best. I mean, it was just the nature of how it evolved and so forth. It was a relatively shadowy industry. And as a result, it was very difficult for an entrepreneur to figure out what was what at a very basic level. And so there were these phenomenal firms like Sequoia or Benchmark or Greylock, but for an entrepreneur to really understand the nuances between the ones that were really great to work with or just people who simply had money and had no idea how a startup should get built was really impossible to tell.</p>\n<p>And I think one of the contributions that we made was just the way we went about things, partly because there was counter-programming, is we put a lot of light on it. And that also, combined with what was going on with social networking, what was going on with the Internet and going on with real entrepreneurial community made entrepreneurs really aware of what they should expect and what they should want from a venture capital firm. And most venture capital firms, as you would expect, just didn\u2019t stand that test.</p>\n<p>Then at the same time, a new tier of venture capital emerged, angel investing or seed investing. And this enabled, for the experimental things, where you really just needed capital and maybe a little bit of advice, there was a whole new functionality at that layer. So, you had the landscape bifurcate into seed investing, where you need a little money and a little help.</p>\n<p>Michael: Right.</p>\n<p>Ben: Or venture capital investing, where you need a lot of money and a lot of help. The whole middle, like we don\u2019t know how to help and we don\u2019t have that much money, like that big set of hundreds of venture capital firms became no longer interesting. And so, the result of the landscape, I think, is it\u2019s a way better time to be an entrepreneur now raising money than it\u2019s ever been before. It\u2019s easier to raise money in small amounts. And then if you raise money in large amounts, you get likely a much better investor than you would have got in the past.</p>\n<p>Michael: We\u2019re seeing large rounds raised, but I want to have you guys answer the question of why do, if I can\u2026 myself and three of my friends and virtually no money and just a credit card and Amazon Web Services, if I can build a company and start on my way, why do I need then traditional venture capital, even at the high end, like that big money? Why is that still necessary?</p>\n<p>Marc: Cheaper to start. More expensive to grow. So, it goes back to what we were talking about before. So the market sizes are much larger. So, the prize is bigger. The market is larger and it takes more money to be able to build a company in the market. And so, yeah, you can start a lot of these companies with three laptops and three lattes a day and you\u2019re off to the races. Three kids living on ramen noodles. But at some point, you need to build the company. And you need to build the company that is then going to go take the market. And the market is big. And the market is global and you\u2019re going to need a company around that.</p>\n<p>You\u2019re going to need a sales force. You\u2019re going to need marketing. You\u2019re going to need a big development organization. You\u2019re going to need customer service, customer support. You\u2019re going to have a big recruiting campaign. You\u2019re going to need partnerships. You\u2019re going to need expansion capital. All these things kick in. And so these companies almost never stay small. It\u2019s extremely rare that you\u2019d see any company that does anything big in tech that doesn\u2019t end up raising\u2026doesn\u2019t end up, number one, raising money and then number two, if you\u2019re going to raise money, raise money from venture capital.</p>\n<p>Michael Copeland: You mentioned \u201cglobal.\u201d I understand global markets, venture capital has done very poorly as a global enterprise. Is that going to change? Do you see that changing at all?</p>\n<p>Ben: Well, I think it will change, but not in the way a lot of people are expecting. And to some extent, it is changing already in the sense that some really large companies are coming out in China right now. Like really big. Alibaba is a monster in a good way. So, it will change. I think that people expected that, \u201cOh, well, if we just focus on building software companies like Silicon Valley, we can be like Silicon Valley.\u201d And that\u2019s been largely mistaken that you can apply policy and tax breaks and even have a good university, but Silicon Valley is a network effect. And if you\u2019re competing with a Silicon Valley company without the level of engineering talent, without the level of executive talent, it\u2019s still rather hard.</p>\n<p>Marc had a really good\u2026 I can\u2019t remember. I think it was a series of tweets rather than posts. But a really good series of tweets which just said, \u201cLook, there should be 50 Silicon Valleys, not one.\u201d Or actually, that was an article. Fifty Silicon Valleys, not one, but they should not be Silicon Valleys. They should be doing things in other areas of technology. Other areas of innovation. And some of that can be facilitated rather than tax free zones, more like regulatory free zones, where things that are very difficult to build here can be built elsewhere. And the world will certainly be a better place if there are lots of new companies coming from lots of places all over the globe. And I think that Silicon Valley set such a great example of what\u2019s possible that that\u2019s going to happen.</p>\n<p>Michael: Do you see evidence already, Marc, of those kind of zones and Silicon Valleys as it were?</p>\n<p>Marc: Yeah. Well, there\u2019s two ways to come at it. One is on the zone side. So, there is actually a long history of this sort of concept of a special economic zone. And actually, countries like Hong Kong at one point and actually China\u2019s a very aggressive user of special economic zones. Actually also the prime minister of Japan, Abe, is now proposing special economic zones in Japan to be able to restart growth. And so, you certainly have a long history with that approach. And then you have examples today where that thing is playing out.</p>\n<p>One very interesting example is South Korea. South Korea has famously been much more liberal in terms of legalizing new stem cell based health projects, which look\u2026 stem cell research for regenerative medicine looks incredibly exciting. And looks like we might be able to grow new organs and do all kinds of things. That research has historically been difficult to do in the US for regulatory reasons. And so, you see more examples of that. But I\u2019ll tell you the other thing you see is just an explosion of entrepreneurial energy and enthusiasm all over the world. You just see\u2026 and we see it all over the place. You see it all throughout the US. Like 20 cities in the US now.</p>\n<p>And then you see it all over the world. The most vivid example is a good friend of mine, Chris Schroeder, wrote an entire book over the last three years called \u201cStartup Rising,\u201d which is the story of high tech entrepreneurship in the Middle East. He traveled all through Jordan and Syria and Egypt and all these countries, going through all these dramatic changes. And in every single country, he found high tech entrepreneurs and startups, building unbelievable new companies and products. And most significantly, he actually just got\u2026 there\u2019s like 15 visas a year for business travelers to Iran. And so he just went to Iran after he wrote the book and he just came back. It turns out in Tehran, there\u2019s a thriving underground high tech startup scene.</p>\n<p>Michael: Wow!</p>\n<p>Marc: And there\u2019s all these entrepreneurs who want to start all these online businesses. If you want to meet\u2026 a 22-year-old who\u2019s incredibly frustrated by the fact that his entire country has been embargoed, he or she in the Tehran high tech scene. So even in countries where you\u2019re most concerned from a geopolitical standpoint, there\u2019s enormous energy and often youth energy towards building these businesses.</p>\n<p>Michael: As a firm, do you need to tap into that directly or indirectly? Or is there\u2026 how do you plan on that going forward, if you do at all?</p>\n<p>Ben: One thing about investing is it\u2019s important to keep in mind that you don\u2019t want to try to do every opportunity. Every firm doesn\u2019t have to be in every deal. And if you try to, unlike running, say, an enterprise software company, where you absolutely do want to get every customer, in investing you want to stick to the things that you\u2019re best suited to do, where you\u2019re the very best firm possible.<br/>\nAnd for us, that\u2019s primarily software based things and primarily Silicon Valley, just because this is what we know. We understand the culture. We understand the technology. And look, different cultures are different. The world may be getting flatter, but it\u2019s certainly not flat in terms of culture and in terms of motivation, in terms of what stock options mean and the difference between beer drinking countries and wine drinking countries. And you have to know all these things to invest effectively globally. So it\u2019s not\u2026 we can have a very good business investing in Silicon Valley. And then whether we expand that or where we expand that, I think, is TBD, but it\u2019s not critical for survival in the way it would be if we were, say, a software company.</p>\n<p>Marc: I think I\u2019d say a lot of our companies actually bear directly on this, right? And so companies like Facebook and Twitter as platforms for global communication. Entrepreneurs are communicating on Facebook and Twitter every single day in incredibly beneficial ways. Or another example is a startup that we\u2019ve seed funded called \u201cTeleport\u201d that\u2019s making it much easier for engineers to consider relocating, like where to locate a new company or how to get talent to be able to move to a new location.</p>\n<p>Or for that matter, Airbnb, which makes it\u2026 or Lyft, which make it much easier for people to travel and be able to temporarily live in other places as they go around to where the different opportunities are. So, one of the things we view ourselves as doing is funding the platform companies that are building this world in which there\u2019s going to be a lot more entrepreneurship.</p>\n<p>Michael: That\u2019s part one of the Ben and Marc podcast.

You\u2019re about to hear part two of the Ben and Marc Explain Practically Everything Podcast. If you missed part one, find it on A16Z.com. Part two picks up with a discussion of disruption theory.</p>\n<p>Michael: Disruption theory has been in the news of late, as it relates to Clayton Christensen, the master of this. I just want to ask you guys, not so much about the criticism of him, but, from where you sit, that theory and his thinking kind of galvanized itself into a book in 1997. Do you build companies differently today? Do those theories still hold water, or what\u2019s changed?</p>\n<p>Ben: Yeah. So I think his book was actually quite brilliant. It\u2019s funny that it\u2019s coming under criticism now, after he\u2019s been proven completely right in the general idea that he had. It actually reminds me of the creationist attacks on evolution, where . . . Yes, from a . . . It\u2019s like intellectualism at its worst, right? It\u2019s like, \u201cOh, here\u2019s something wrong with Darwin\u2019s original theory.\u201d</p>\n<p>Michael: Right.</p>\n<p>Ben: It\u2019s like, \u201cOkay.\u201d Now, we based all of biology on it. We made tremendous progress. How about that? This is kind of like, \u201cI don\u2019t believe in it. I don\u2019t believe in electricity.\u201d This is kind of the business kind of version of that, where he developed the theory. All of us in high tech . . . It was an amazing business book at the time because it explained a phenomenon that now is kind of obvious, but in 1997 it was tricky, which is really \u2014 why did there need to be new companies?</p>\n<p>Michael: Right.</p>\n<p>Ben: What\u2019s happened, we just got through talking about, there\u2019s an explosion of new companies, and these companies aren\u2019t trivial. They\u2019re becoming very, very important companies, like Google and Facebook and so forth, so, he\u2019s kind of been proven right. Not only has he been proven right on kind of the large level, but the mechanics that prevent the kind of incumbents from innovating at the same rate as the new company are still completely in effect. We use his models all the time in our thinking and our analysis. No doubt, there are probably some minor problems with examples he\u2019s used or the way he worded it or what have you, but basically he was right.</p>\n<p>Marc: Yeah, I would also say two things. I\u2019d say one is we actually use his theory basically to tell us what not to invest in, as well as what to invest in.</p>\n<p>Michael: How so?</p>\n<p>Marc: For example, we have basically this theory that basically is very, very dangerous. One of the great things about our industry, about venture capital, is you get to do these things that basically disrupt sort of the big established companies. Conversely, a very dangerous thing to do is to attack companies that are, our internal term is the new incumbents. It\u2019s one thing to go attack a tech company that\u2019s been in business for 50 years, that\u2019s on its sixth CEO or something like that. It\u2019s another thing to go attack Google, being run by Larry Page, because Larry Page is fully aware of the theory of disruption and in full command of his company. If he sees a disruptive threat coming, he is quite capable of doing the things to head it off that a fourth-generation professional CEO might not be able to do.</p>\n<p>Anyway, so that was one thing I wanted to say. The other thing I want to say is disruption, I agree with<br/>\nBen. It\u2019s funny that this is a topic now, but since it is, it\u2019s worth talking about, which is the term \u201cdisruption,\u00e2\u0080\u009d by its very nature, the term itself has negative connotations, right? Disruption seems like it\u2019s one step away from destruction. It\u2019s getting this kind of popular conception that there\u2019s something bad about it. The actual way that Christensen used the term was actually in a very sort of applied way, in a very specific circumstance in business and actually in a very positive way, which is, basically, he described it as a way that progress happens.</p>\n<p>Progress doesn\u2019t happen by old companies deciding to do new things. Progress happens because new companies decide to do new things, and then disruption is the process by which the new things are able to take over for the old things. If you decide you don\u2019t like disruption, what you\u2019re basically saying is you don\u2019t like new things. Basically, to be against disruption is to basically be pro the status quo and pro the status quo means however the world is today, that\u2019s it. That\u2019s all we\u2019re going to have. The way things work today, this is as good as it\u2019s ever going to get. The disruption argument is, \u201cNo, no, no, no, no. Things can become much better. Products can become much better. Businesses can become much better. Opportunities for people can become much better.\u201d It\u2019s a negatively connoted term that has very positive implications. I think that that\u2019s really, at least in the last couple years, that\u2019s been lost in a lot of the commentary.</p>\n<p>Michael: You mentioned Google and one of the things that we\u2019ve seen through the technology industry\u2019s history is that it\u2019s very, very hard to disrupt yourself and kind of make a transition from one thing to another. IBM may be the only company that\u2019s done it. Google, they\u2019re trying everything. Facebook is trying everything. Do these companies somehow change the rules, or is it the same rules applying, and disruption theory catches up with them in 50 years maybe?</p>\n<p>Ben: I think you kind of have to break that back apart and go back to what Marc said. I think that people often think of, \u201cBig companies can\u2019t innovate. Little companies can,\u201d but the real truth is new companies can innovate, and companies that are so old that the original inventors are gone have a lot of trouble doing it. If you go back to HP or IBM or any of these companies, when the founder, when Thomas Watson was running the company, when Dave Packard was running the company, they didn\u2019t have any trouble doing new things.</p>\n<p>Marc: Right.</p>\n<p>Ben: They did it phenomenally. HP, in particular, did a crazy number of new things, just amazing and, in retrospect, really phenomenal. If Mark Zuckerberg is running the company or Larry Page is running the company, that\u2019s not an old company. That\u2019s a new company. As innovators, we believe, and this gets back to why we don\u2019t attack them, because they\u2019ll attack right back and very effectively. They\u2019re going to be able to do new things. Sometimes, that will mean bring in new talent through acquisition or new technologies through acquisition, but they\u2019re going to be able to think about the problem through a lens that is not the business they\u2019re in.</p>\n<p>This is the amazing thing that Clayton Christensen laid out, was that if you\u2019re an old company run by professional managers, you\u2019re really good at studying and optimizing the business you\u2019re in, so, if there\u2019s a new business that comes along that is inconsistent with that, you get stuck, but if you\u2019re Mark Zuckerberg, who created a business from nothing, then you have a very different view of the world. It\u2019s not like, \u201cOkay. How do I optimize the business that I\u2019m in?\u201d It\u2019s like, \u201cWell, how do I get another business that\u2019s like Facebook?\u201d That\u2019s more the way you think about it.</p>\n<p>Marc: The other thing is the fact that Christensen was able to articulate this in a theory that\u2019s so clear and put it in the book is . . . I think the best professional CEOs in the tech industry today now understand this in a way that maybe their predecessors 10 or 20 years ago didn\u2019t understand it.</p>\n<p>Michael: Right.</p>\n<p>Marc: I just got to give you two examples of people I work with, John Donahoe at eBay, like when mobile came along. Sort of classical professional CEOs, when mobile comes along, would look at it and say, \u201cWell, I\u2019ve got this great business on the web. If I move to mobile, it may or may not work as well. Maybe I don\u2019t want to try to make the move. Maybe I want to stay on the web and reinforce the web and not take the risk of \u2018disrupting\u2019 myself by making the jump to mobile,\u201d but since John understands disruption theory, and it\u2019s been articulated and explained in a way that makes sense, he was able to do a phenomenally successful job. He went full-throttle into mobile, and they made the jump. They\u2019ve done very well.</p>\n<p>Meg Whitman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been doing the same thing with this . . . Just one example is this Project Moonshot, which is these cartridge-based servers.</p>\n<p>Michael: At HP, right?</p>\n<p>Marc: At HP, that are direct attacks on the existing Blade Server business. The Blade Server business at HP is a very, very big and profitable business and HP is basically self-disrupting with this new kind of cartridge-based server. Again, when you have an HP board meeting and you have the discussion, you\u2019re like, \u201cOkay. Why are we taking the risk of damaging this big, existing, profitable business by doing this new thing?\u2019 The answer is because it\u2019s the right thing to do, according to disruption theory.</p>\n<p>Michael: Right.</p>\n<p>Marc: It is. There is a logical framework. Again, think about what\u2019s happening, which is something new is happening. Progress is happening. This is now the reason and the motivation and the explanation and the justification to be able to make progress. So it\u2019s an incredibly powerful, positive thing.</p>\n<p>Michael: Let\u2019s get to entrepreneurs and entrepreneurship. You guys founded the firm, in part, I\u2019ve been told, because of what you wished you\u2019d been told or helped in certain ways. What\u2019s one thing both of you wish you knew or someone had told you, as entrepreneurs?</p>\n<p>Ben: Well, that presumes we would\u2019ve listened. There\u2019s just so much that we did not know, going through it the first time. One of the great things about the entrepreneurial experience is it\u2019s just an amazing learning curve about everything, from markets to organizational structures to compensation to everything. Probably one of the most challenging things to learn while you\u2019re out there is kind of how macro-economics impact markets and particularly how private funding can change very, very rapidly. This wasn\u2019t as harsh a lesson at Netscape, but at OpsWare and LoudCloud, it was incredibly difficult for us to go from a funding environment in which we basically had the highest multiples in the history of anything, to there was no money available, period.</p>\n<p>It was the most traumatic fall imaginable, from the highest of highs to the lowest of lows. To have the Nasdaq fall over 80%, and that\u2019s Nasdaq. That\u2019s not tech. Tech fell 95%. It\u2019s just not something you could even imagine or get your head around. I wish we would\u2019ve known that. I don\u2019t know if we would\u2019ve believed anybody if they had told us that, but that would\u2019ve probably made it a little less painful if we had any idea how bad it could be.</p>\n<p>Michael: It would\u2019ve made a worse book, I\u2019ll tell you that, that you wrote, but still.</p>\n<p>Ben: Yeah. Yeah.</p>\n<p>Michael: On the other side of the table, what do you want more of or less of from entrepreneurs?</p>\n<p>Ben: It\u2019s very different across different businesses, but the one thing that would probably be nice if there was less of, that\u2019s pretty consistent, is it\u00e2\u0080\u0099d be nice if it wasn\u2019t so important to entrepreneurs what their peers\u2019 valuations were.</p>\n<p>Marc: Yep.</p>\n<p>Ben: That is probably the most meaningless thing to focus your mind on, as an entrepreneur, imaginable. It\u2019s just like irrelevant.</p>\n<p>Michael: But wait, you don\u2019t have anything else to base your value on. Do you?</p>\n<p>Marc: No, no, no. You go ahead.</p>\n<p>Ben: Yeah. Your company is your company. Their company is their company. You\u2019re looking at the price they got, not any of the business metrics that they have or how the company is going, so you\u2019re not actually basing your valuation on anything in that sense. There\u2019s better data to be gotten, for sure. We have better data. We can talk to them about all the kind of valuations based on actual revenue and so forth, as opposed to the person they went to school with or the person they worked at their last company with.</p>\n<p>Michael: Right.</p>\n<p>Ben: People get very wrapped around the axle on that because it\u2019s kind of the thing that Peter Thiel talks about, where competition is actually really destructive. That\u2019s the worst kind of competition because it\u2019s competition that\u2019s irrelevant to anything in life, other than you can go tell your friend what valuation you got. I think that it causes bad errors in judgment and delays in decisions that need to be made quickly and things like that. It\u2019s one of those things where humanity gets the better of you and less of that would be good.</p>\n<p>Michael: Marc, anything you would offer on that?</p>\n<p>Marc: Well, the thing that the great entrepreneurs all have in common, we talk about this a lot, but you just see it every day, is the great entrepreneurs all have amazing courage. I would say we\u2019re blessed, in that a lot of the entrepreneurs we work with, and we select for it. We try very hard to select for it, but the entrepreneurs that we work with that are amazing, one of the things they all have in common is they\u2019re incredibly courageous, by which I mean they don\u2019t give up.</p>\n<p>They don\u2019t quit, they don\u2019t flinch, they don\u2019t get demoralized. Well, actually they may get demoralized or depressed, but they show up to work the next day, and they work their way out of whatever problem they\u2019re in. They just keep pounding and pounding and pounding and pounding. I think there\u2019s a little bit too much in the Valley right now of the pivot and the lean startup and everything is experiment and minimum viable product and failure is good and kind of all these excuses to be able to give up when things aren\u2019t going well.</p>\n<p>I think that the great entrepreneurs, through history, have always been the opposite kind of personality to all that. They\u2019ve always been, \u201cI\u2019m going to make this thing work, hell or high water. No matter what, I am going to knock my way head-first through any barrier that I run into. I don\u2019t care what people say about me. I don\u2019t care what kinds of problems I have. I\u2019m going to figure this out, and I\u2019m not going to give up.\u201d I would just say we love working with people who have that personality type.</p>\n<p>Michael: Right.</p>\n<p>Marc: You can never have enough of them.</p>\n<p>Michael: Elon Musk comes to mind. Cars and space?</p>\n<p>Marc: Yeah. Yeah. So to start, think about this. To start a new electric car company and, by the way, think about the last car company started in the United States. They literally made a movie about the catastrophe that resulted, which is this movie \u201cTucker.\u201d So if you want a story of a horrible business\u2026</p>\n<p>Ben: Which went better than Delorean.</p>\n<p>Marc: Yes. Well, actually yeah. Well, he had the cocaine-smuggling business on the side, which helped to fray the expenses. Car companies, like all the car companies in the US that are successful, are from the 1910s, 1920s.</p>\n<p>To start a new car company in the electric car category, where all the electric cars had failed, simultaneously to start the first new private rocketry company in the United States in probably 40 years, to go straight up against the big boys, to do those at the same time and then to go through the 2008 crash. He has actually recently opened up on this. He almost lost both companies in 2008. They almost both vaporized, and then to gut through both of those and have both come out the other side, just gigantic screaming successes, it\u2019s a spectacular performance. A huge part of it is he didn\u2019t give up.</p>\n<p>Michael: Ben, let\u2019s touch on your book a little bit, \u201cThe Hard Thing About Hard Things.\u201d One thing, it got great reception, but you\u2019re like, \u201cWell, yeah, that sounds good for you, Ben, but that was your story.\u201d How can I embrace that and make it my story? Was there anything in the response that you wished people had pushed you harder on?</p>\n<p>Ben: Well, the things that people pushed me on actually annoyed me, so it\u2019s hard to say that I wish about that. I think that, to your point though, it was my story. The reason for that, there was a really specific reason for that, which is building these companies tends to be very dynamic and very situational and so a very frustrating thing about management advice in general, and particularly both in books and then things that you often get from board members or kind of pattern-matchers, as it were, is that they\u2019re giving you advice, and it\u2019s based on something. What it\u2019s based on may or may not be relevant to you. If you don\u2019t know what it is, it\u2019s very difficult to interpret it. I always found that management books would give guidance, and you\u2019d be like, \u201cWell, okay. Is that what I should be doing?\u201d But I have no idea where it came from, so, it\u2019s hard to say.</p>\n<p>A lot of putting my story in was just to say, \u201cLook. This is why I\u2019m telling you this. If your situation is completely different than this, then that might be the part of the book that you ignore, or at least maybe you can map it onto what you\u2019re doing.\u201d I think that without knowing why somebody is telling you something, it\u2019s pretty difficult to get value out of it.</p>\n<p>Marc: On the topic of the entrepreneurial journey, we have to go see a pitch.</p>\n<p>Michael: All right. That\u2019s what you guys get paid to do. Ben and Marc, thanks so much. We will do this, well, we won\u2019t do it in five years. We\u2019ll do it much sooner than that. Thank you very much.</p>\n<p>Ben: Sure. Okay. Great.</p>\n<p>Marc: Thanks, Michael.</p>\n<p>Ben: Thanks, Michael.</p>\n", "author": "Marc Andreessen, Ben Horowitz"}, "75": {"podcast": "a16z Shows on Clubhouse | Andreessen Horowitz", "url": "https://a16z.com/clubhouse/", "contents": "The Good Time Show.

And next up, we have somebody who has pretty much changed the world of entertainment, who is known as a super agent. You may all seen him played by Jeremy Piven on \u201cEntourage\u201d as Ari Gold. But then has gone on to conquer everything from UFC to bowling to\u2026if you go to a live event, he\u2019s probably involved in it somehow. So, without any further ado, it gives me great pleasure to welcome Marc Andreessen and Ari Emanuel. Give it up.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">So, let\u2019s start with the serious stuff. What\u2019s the meet-cute story between you two? How did the two of you first meet, Ari?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Ari Emanuel:</strong> Marc was on the cover of \u201cForbes,\u201d and I actually don\u2019t remember the article. And it\u2019s what I normally do because I have this phrase that I try and create serendipity. I read the article, and I blind called Marc. I had never met him before. This time he picked up the phone call. I said, \u201cI\u2019d like to meet you. I read the article. I kind of thought it was incredible.\u201d I said, \u201cI\u2019ll fly up.\u201d He says, \u201cNo, I\u2019ll fly down.\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">He flew down. We had a meeting. I think, in the meeting, I started raising money because we had just started a merchant bank called Raine. He said he would put in money, but he wanted to bring his two friends along. One was Nikesh, and one was Egon Durban. Egon Durban from Silver Lake is my largest investor, and that\u2019s just the serendipity of life and how I create serendipity. And that\u2019s how we met.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Marc Andreessen:</strong> Now, the number one rule of business is you never, ever cold call.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Ari:</strong> I only cold call.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Marc:</strong> You only cold call, exactly.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Sriram:</strong> We are in LA Tech Week, after all. And at the LA Tech ecosystem, the scene here in LA, what do you think?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Marc:</strong> There\u2019s been this long-running, basically, drama, a story, story arc over the last 25 or 30 years. My first meetings with the big entertainment companies were like 1994, explaining the internet, and being like, \u201cOkay, this thing might be a big deal someday.\u201d And there was this extraordinarily long period of time where there in theory was going to be a convergence. The buzzword literally used to be convergence. And it would literally be a coming together of the two great California industries of entertainment and culture, and then tech. And in theory, it was going to happen, in theory, it was going to happen. And then it turned out to be war a lot of the time. And I think it\u2019s fair to say the entertainment industry viewed new tech for a long time as a threat.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Ari:</strong> Still do.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Marc:</strong> And that may still be the case. And then, in theory, the tech industry at some point was going to do\u2026it could do entertainment. But the running joke was like, \u201cWe\u2019re so nerdy and stiff in Northern California, if we made a movie, it would be like the movie version of the manual for a Cisco router,\u201d not be the most compelling, exciting content in the world. And so, there is this weird shadowboxing thing where nothing ever really came together. And then it feels like, I guess, probably Netflix was the big breakthrough, or streaming?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Ari:</strong>\u00c2\u00a0I think it probably started a little bit in gaming. And then entertainment companies that we consider entertainment movie companies thought they could take the IP. And they didn\u2019t realize that was making billions of dollars and they were not that important in the movie business. But maybe now it will happen with kind of what Unity is doing, and Web3. So, who knows? My sense is the first company that actually did it was Netflix to kind of bring it, if we define that as technology.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Marc:</strong> And it was kind of a two-part thing, right, which is what\u2026one is, Netflix, all of a sudden, is a distribution medium for video, like a new premier distribution medium. The first new one probably, what, since DVDs, probably videotapes before that\u2026</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Ari:</strong> Yeah. Blockbuster.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Marc:</strong> \u2026satellite TV. But the first one really out of Silicon Valley. And then the other ones, of course, Netflix then actually started making content.\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Ari:</strong> I sold the first.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Sriram:</strong> Really?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Ari:</strong> Yeah.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Sriram:</strong> What was it?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Ari:</strong> It was a little show about Washington, D.C. somebody got arrested for.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Marc:</strong> \u201cHouse of Cards.\u201d The brilliant and amazing \u201cHouse of Cards.\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Ari:</strong> It was a classic story. So, their stock had fallen because they did the double pricing and\u2026</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Sriram:</strong> Quickster.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Ari:</strong> Yeah. The whole craziness with the DVDs and everything. And then a company I had started called MRC had this treatment. [David] Fincher was attached, HBO was going to do a pilot, and Ted [Sarandos] came and realized, \u201cOkay, we got to figure this out.\u201d And he put 13 episodes up at\u2026I think it was $150 million. Fincher went overboard, \u201cWe need another $15 million.\u201d I mean, HBO could not believe that we were going to go to Netflix and do that over the brand of HBO. Ten million to 150 million, it was an easy conversation. And we were off to the races at that point.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Sriram:</strong> So, let\u2019s fast forward to 2022. Netflix just had maybe not the greatest earnings quarter, right? Is the golden age of TV over? Marc just grumbles all the time when he\u2019s not finding anything interesting to watch. Or where do you see content going?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Ari:</strong> That is like the biggest lie in the world. All I get all the time from him. \u201cHave you seen this show? Have you seen that show? Have you seen this show?\u201d I mean, it\u2019s like\u2026that\u2019s a fallacy. And you know that.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Marc:</strong> Cornucopia. Well, okay. Is the quality holding up?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Ari:</strong> Yes.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Marc:</strong> Okay, all right. Okay. All right.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Ari:</strong> I mean, it depends on\u2026you can get content from anywhere. There\u2019s plenty of great content. There\u2019s a lot of bad content. But okay, don\u2019t watch it.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Marc:</strong> How many TV\u2026</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Ari:</strong> How many things are on my list for Netflix? Fifty.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Marc:</strong> How many TV shows are being filmed this year in the\u2026</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Ari:</strong> I think it\u2019s television shows, between non-scripted and scripted, I want to say 900. Probably more.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Marc:</strong> Nine hundred, And 20 years ago, that would have been?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Ari:</strong> In 2011, I want to say it was\u2026no, 2009, it was 39. 2011, I think it was 130. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">And the problem is, it used to be a drama for linear television would be $2.5 million, $3 million. Now, an episode, now it\u2019s $16 million. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">And you can\u2019t get special effects people. I mean, there\u2019s no studio space. There\u2019s some physical issues surrounding all that. That\u2019s hopefully why tech and us come together, maybe there are ways to figure that out.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Sriram:</strong> So, let\u2019s get into that. So, we had just some examples. \u201cThe Mandalorian\u201d shot entirely in Unreal Engine Power thing. We\u2019ve had \u201cStar Trek: Discovery,\u201d one of my favorite shows, shot by motion capture in the actors\u2019 homes. We had indie movies do great VFX. Do you think, A, is there a democratization of movies done by indie filmmakers coming up?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Ari:</strong> No.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Sriram:</strong> What do you think? What do you think, Marc?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Marc:</strong> Well, so a couple of things. So, one is Hollywood has had a pattern over the decades of it sort of hits a creative\u2026I don\u2019t know, whatever, wall of some form. And then there\u2019s a reinvention of the medium of film. And that happened in the 1970s, right, with the New Hollywood. It happened again in the 1990s with the indies and Quentin Tarantino.\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Ari:</strong> Listen, there\u2019s always going to be people pushing technology and pushing what that means. It\u2019s happened in the music business. To make an album now it almost costs you nothing. Before, it used to cost you a lot of money. Is it going to happen in movies? Yeah. But then there\u2019s going to be filmmakers that want to do it the old way, and on film. And so, there\u2019s no set rules to it. Do I think that because of that, pricing is going to come down? No, because you\u2019re going to have to put actors in it. It does take writers. Writers cost now a lot of money because they\u2019re doing three or four projects. So, the economics are going to be the economics. Is there going to be technology around shooting stuff maybe cheaper? Yes, possibly.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">And just answer to the other question, so in 1974, Charlie Bluhdorn, none of you know who he was, he was running Gulf and Western that did\u2026</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Marc:</strong> He\u2019s in \u201cThe Offer.\u201d You can see him now. Paramount just made this TV show, Paramount streaming, about the making of \u201cThe Godfather.\u201d Tremendously good movie. You can learn all about it.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Ari:</strong> He goes and says\u2026and I think it was 1974, in \u201cVariety\u201d which is a trade paper in Hollywood, he goes, \u201cThe movie business is over.\u201d When I start the firm in \u201995 they go, \u201cThe television business is over.\u201d And then at the time there was four networks going to five, and I was like, \u201cHow could the television business be over and they\u2019re starting two new distribution points?\u201d So, all I would say to you is, you and I would never pay for ads on direct to consumer. There\u2019s going to be a VOD. There\u2019s going to be more\u2026if it\u2019s now 900, it\u2019s going to be 1500 by the time we\u2019re done. Distribution is expanding and you\u2019re going to have to fill the pipes.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">And if you just look at the numbers right now, people are going to Paramount+, they\u2019re watching \u201cThe Offer.\u201d And then when they\u2019re done watching \u201cThe Offer,\u201d they get rid of Paramount. And the only way to keep them is either through sports or through new content. And so, there\u2019s just going to be more and more content being built. And then they\u2019re going to have to figure out the economics because the economics are extraordinary right now.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Sriram:</strong> Okay. I\u2019m going to ask a question to Marc, though I think Ari has a strong opinion on this. So, I\u2019ll let Marc go first. So, best movie of the summer, \u201cTop Gun: Maverick,\u201d right? We had multiple MCU movies come out. This week, we have a LOTR prequel, and I believe a Game of Thrones prequel come out. Marc, what do you think is happening, and will we ever see original IP again? And then Ari can respond.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Marc:</strong> Okay, I\u2019m going to drive him straight through the ceiling. There\u2019s the system. I mean, there\u2019s the system. There\u2019s whatever the studio system or whatever it is that you would call sort of their inheritance of the studio system, and they\u2019re sort of \u201cmainstream.\u201d And then, of course, there\u2019s this extraordinary kind of\u2026 What\u2019s the indie scene of today? It\u2019s YouTube, it\u2019s TikTok. It\u2019s this complete\u2026just this incredible long tail in this incredible creative universe. And so, you\u2019ve got this weird thing, right?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">So, one of the hallmarks of the evolution of the entertainment industry, see if you agree with this, is that the previous medium becomes the content for the new medium. Right? And so, written stories become the content for stage plays. Stage plays become the content for movies. Movies now become the content for streaming services. And so, that\u2019s part of what happens. And so, you bring all these old mediums along with you, but you also get new creators doing new kinds of things. And they\u2019re not making movies, they\u2019re not making TV shows. They\u2019re making original video short form content. They\u2019re having a completely different kind of relationship with their audience.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">And so, you\u2019ve got this completely parallel universe running. And of course, there\u2019s some crossover, which is you\u2019ve got some of those people that then want to sign up with you, and then want to become TV or movie stars. But you also have this whole parallel world. Agree with that? You guys agree with that?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Ari:</strong> Yeah, I completely agree. I mean, it\u2019s the basis of the firm. So, my\u2026the George Gilder book, \u201cLife After Television,\u201d is\u2026there\u2019s going to be more distribution than ever. That\u2019s why we built the firm, because we get more verticals, books, etc., social. So, one form of distribution is social. One form of distribution is movies and television, one form is betting, gambling, one form is games. There\u2019s just more distribution and more content because we have more and more free time. And that\u2019s what people want. And there is crossover to that. Right? And that\u2019s ultimately how we\u2019re built to make sure that\u2026we\u2019re not perfect at it, make sure that it happens. And when somebody creates an incredible piece of content on social that can elevate up, that\u2019s hopefully what happens.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">But that does not mean, based on your question, there will not be original IP. I went through the whole period when shows came out of the UK, right? \u201cThe Office,\u201d I put it together, we represented the star in the UK and gave it to Greg Daniels, who I represent, and we put it on the air. That happens. But then there\u2019s just Larry David and \u201cCurb Your Enthusiasm,\u201d and that\u2019s original.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Marc:</strong> Well, Curb\u2019s original\u2026 When did \u201cSeinfeld\u201d start? When did \u201cSeinfeld\u201d premiere? 1992?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Ari:</strong> Well, Curb\u2019s been on for 13 years, and then so that was another 9 years. And then, yeah, it\u2019s about 23 years ago.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Marc:</strong> Twenty-three years ago. So, that\u2019s pretty\u2026I mean, it\u2019s great, it\u2019s fantastic.\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Ari:</strong> There\u2019s tons of original shows.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Sriram:</strong> Okay, we were talking about the future of content on two things. First of all, one thing is VR, which I know, Marc, you\u2019re passionate about. How do you think VR\u2026 some of the more immersive experience, how do we thing that\u2019s going to change content.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Marc:</strong> So, look, the bull case for VR is really powerful.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Ari:</strong> Isn\u2019t AR that the bull case is for?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Marc:</strong> No. Definitely not. The bull case is definitely VR.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Ari:</strong> Really?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Marc:</strong> So, this is actually\u2026</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Ari:</strong> We\u2019re going to make a bet right now.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Marc:</strong> This is a great East Coast-West Coast thing. And Ari is currently challenging\u2026he\u2019s currently channeling\u2026</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Sriram:</strong> Ari West Coast.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Marc:</strong> Yes, but\u2026</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Ari:</strong> Emotionally at East Coast.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Marc:</strong> So, what I would say is all of the non-nerds think that AR is the big thing. All the nerds think the VR is going to be the big thing. Because the non-nerds are\u2026</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Ari:</strong> I\u2019m not sure if I should be insulted by that.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Marc:</strong> Well, you need to decide. And hopefully, this will keep you up late tonight as you try to figure out whether that was an insult. So, look, the non-nerds, they like real life. They like real life. They get up in the morning, the world\u2019s a cool place. They hang out with lots of cool people. It\u2019s all great. They have a cool time. And so, the idea of a medium like VR that would blank out the real world and replace it with something else seems like it must be bad. And a medium like AR that feels like it would overlay on the real world, seems like it\u2019d be good. What us nerds know is that the world sucks. Right? The world\u2019s not like that. The world\u2019s not cool like that.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Ari:</strong> Do you actually think the world sucks?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Marc:</strong> Well\u2026</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Ari:</strong> I\u2019m asking you a question. So, you actually think the world sucks? Do you actually think it sucks?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Marc:</strong> I think for\u2026</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Ari:</strong> Because you have a fucking good life. Do you think it sucks? Do you actually think it sucks? Because if you think it sucks, we\u2019re all fucked. I mean, seriously. I mean, I\u2019m leaving.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Marc:</strong> It\u2019s a reasonably good point.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Ari:</strong> Okay. Reasonably.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Marc:</strong> No. But for a lot of people in the world, the world does suck. A lot of people live in places where there\u2019s nothing interesting going on. A lot of people live in places where there aren\u2019t interesting people to talk to.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Ari:</strong> That\u2019s why there\u2019s 900 shows on the air.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Marc:</strong> So, look, if the world is not that great, then the idea of the actual medium that actually puts you in a different world is incredibly compelling. And so, the actual question would be like, what is the ratio basically between those two populations? And I think it\u2019s just obviously true that for most people it\u2026</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Ari:</strong> You\u2019re avoiding my question. Does the world suck?</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">I actually think the world\u2019s really good. I think there\u2019s some bad things that happen. And I think there\u2019s probably going to be a place for, I guess I\u2019m not a nerd, for us non-nerds, and there\u2019s going to be a place for the nerds. And it doesn\u2019t mean that they can\u2019t coexist.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Marc:</strong> Well, okay. Let me make a stronger pro-VR argument. The stronger pro-VR argument is that it\u2019s\u2026so, sometimes, it gets referred to by people in the field, it\u2019s the last medium. And I was going to say, this is a very provocative statement because we\u2019ve had many, many different forms of entertainment media basically through the centuries. But they\u2019ve all ended up, like the best case scenario today is that it\u2019s on the screen, on the wall, and maybe it\u2019s got the 3D or whatever. But that\u2019s what it is. But the point of the final medium that I think people should mull over, people should think about is like, look, if you can take the entire sensory apparatus, if you can literally be in the thing, then\u2026</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Ari:</strong> Then I agree with you.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Marc:</strong> And then it\u2019s like the last\u2026because there\u2019s no place to go after that.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Ari:</strong> Yeah, but I don\u2019t have to make that decision now. When it comes, I\u2019ll be the first one in.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Sriram:</strong> Making money. I love it. Okay. So, next, changing gears, a lot of people here are involved in the economy, they\u2019re maybe\u2026 themselves. I mean\u2026 companies. At a16z, we definitely are. Ari, I\u2019m curious, people with audiences, creators with audiences, they could be sports stars, movie stars. You do a lot of work with them. Where do you see that going. Why is it important, where do you see that headed?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Ari:</strong> The interesting thing about our two firms is we\u2019ve built the business that it started out in the movie and television business, and then it went to non-scripted, books, music, theater. Then we went to sports, we went to fashion, art, betting, taste, meaning food. And then we built layers, a licensing business, a commercial sponsorship business, so that when we enter somebody\u2019s life, whether that be cricket, or whether that be an actor, or influencer, we have the ability to kind of take them global, and also take them across all the things that they want to do to build a business. And whether that be Mark Wahlberg, or Dwayne Johnson, or whomever, to a powerful influencer.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">And so, they\u2019re all realizing the value of their brands, and that they have the impact they can do. And we talked about this this morning. You have a big actor, a big actress, or sports star, they love what they do in acting, or in the sport they\u2019re in. But they also realize that\u2019s kind of like a commercial that enables them to make money across all these other places. And that\u2019s the difference, I think, that we\u2019ve realized. We started this thing called Talent Ventures. We invest off our balance sheet to make sure we\u2019re kind of enabling certain things that we can influence. And that\u2019s where all these people now, stars, or people of influence, or that have social followings, realize the power that they have in all this downstream or upstream economics and brands.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">And that\u2019s kind of what the firm is now built to do. We call it architecture, how we introduce that across platform. And that\u2019s what we do. I don\u2019t know if that answered your question.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Sriram:</strong> Well, I think it does. It\u2019s really about the power of having a large audience. Speaking of it, Marc, you have a million followers on Twitter. Two questions. One, what do you think of just the power of having an audience as a creator, and where do you think it\u2019s headed? And two, when are you going to tweet again?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Marc:</strong> I have to get back\u2026</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Sriram:</strong> Who wants to see Marc tweet again?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Audience:</strong> Yeah.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Sriram:</strong> Yeah, I don\u2019t know about that. Oh, wow.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Marc:</strong> There was a lot of\u2026a lot of a lot of hesitation from the crowd. A lot of hesitation here up on stage.</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">So, look, I think there\u2019s\u2026so, this is where, again, I would be super bull on the following. I think sort of the social networking revolution, the idea of having these sort of direct brands, direct followings through social media, I think it\u2019s probably still significantly underestimated. I would go so far as to say I think we\u2026</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Ari:</strong> I agree.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Marc:</strong> \u2026I think we might be in the final era of corporate brands. I actually think this might be it for corporate brands or product brands because, fundamentally, if you think about it, why does the corporate brand exist, right? Or why does the product brand exist? Just because\u2026 So, from the era of mass marketing, mass production, mass media, where you had these very thin, narrow pipes to be able to get messages to people. So, you had to run TV commercials. You needed to put a brand on things and put it on the shelves.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">But now in this sort of peer-to-peer connected world that we have where you can pick the people you want to follow, and have this kind of para-social relationship with them, and kind of be part of their lives, all of a sudden, it\u2019s like, \u201cOkay, now I can actually have a relationship with a person.\u201d And a relationship with a person will always trump the relationship with a company. Right? And so, I actually think that\u2026I think, basically, anybody with a large scale following is probably dramatically under-punching their weight today in terms of what\u2019s possible.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Ari:</strong> I agree with that.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Marc:</strong> I am a\u2026 Okay, here is a good question. So, I went on Twitter basically because I wanted to chin a million Twitter followers. And Elon\u2019s up to 100-and-probably-20 million Twitter followers, something like that.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Sriram:</strong> There are a lot of questions about numbers. I don\u2019t want to get into trouble.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Marc:</strong> So, I am 1/120th of Elon, just in terms of follower count. So, I don\u2019t know, I\u2019m like 12 micro Elons or something.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Ari:</strong> But that\u2019s powerful.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Marc:</strong> Well, that\u2019s the thing. It\u2019s 12 micro Elons, is that proportionate?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Ari</strong>: The question I have for you, if you actually put your mind to it, how many you think you can get?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Marc:</strong> Well, this is the thing. I think these guys have laid out a playbook where if you really put your mind to it\u2026</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Ari:</strong> I think you could get up to 50.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Marc:</strong> I think I probably could. Now. I just think this is a playbook that actually hasn\u2019t\u2026 Everybody in social media today is still experimenting. We don\u2019t actually\u2026</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Ari:</strong> No, everybody\u2026 Listen, the lot of guard is, you have to protect the brand. You have to really kind of not oversaturate. They have written completely a different go for it, doesn\u2019t matter. And there is consequences to that. So, yeah.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Sriram:</strong> Well, maybe we\u2019ll see you on social media someday.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Ari:</strong> Yeah. Maybe.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Sriram:</strong> The title of the session was ostensibly Art of the Deal, not regular people. And both of you allegedly for deal-making. Right? So, Ari, what do you now know about buying a company, making a deal? Because a lot of people here are in VC. They\u2019re founders. And some day, they want to be where both of you are. What do you now know about making a deal that you didn\u2019t know when you started? And you made some big ones? The UFC party, one of the biggest ones. What do you now know? How do you go about it?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Ari:</strong> Well, listen, I would say to you, most of the time when I\u2019m trying to either buy a company or make a deal, and the hardest thing for me, because I do have ADHD and I just want to get\u2026you do have to know how to shift gears. In the television business, when I was first starting out, you went from first gear to fifth gear. And then because you had seasons, and by May, you knew the show was going. The movie business is a lot slower. Buying companies, running a company, you really have to slow it down, and you actually have to show up. I think 90% of you come with all the baggage, good and bad, but showing up, coming up with good ideas, and being present. And I\u2019m in the middle of one right now, trying to get a deal done. You have to be relentless.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Sriram:</strong> Bye the way, because there are some stories about how long you\u2019ve courted some of these companies. How many phone calls?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Ari:</strong> Yeah, a lot, I would just say. But you just have to be relentless, and you have to be creative about your approach because it can be\u2026I can be exhausting.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Marc:</strong> I know.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Ari:</strong> So, when you go at them, you have to kind of bring some charm to it and everything. But you have to just keep on showing up because\u2026and that takes a lot of emotional endurance. And I think it\u2019s the hardest thing that we all have, especially with social and all that. And you have to come with great ideas of where you would take it. Because on the UFC deal, none of the numbers on paper worked out at the beginning. And we were in the middle of it. It was nine days of hell. My phone was on my chest, and just solving problems. And then Brexit happened, the banking systems fell\u2026 I mean, it was a disaster. And in the middle of it, one of my partners said, \u201cAre you sure you want to do this?\u201d And I said, \u201cNo, I\u2019m not sure. We are doing this.\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">And that\u2019s just what it takes. It just takes hanging in there, having emotional endurance. And when you have to get on a plane and do the things you have to do, you just have to do it. It doesn\u2019t matter how tired, or how exhausted, or how emotionally trying it is. And I think that\u2019s the hardest thing to do kind of when you\u2019re starting a firm, getting that emotional endurance to kind of weather those storms because they all happen to us. In the 27 years, COVID was horrible, \u201908 was horrible. I mean, you just have to\u2026that\u2019s kind of the secret sauce, if you can have that emotional endurance. And it\u2019s also win the deal, and to try to buy a company or build a company.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Sriram:</strong> Which made a good segue into this. I mean, everyone is super happy here, but I think a lot of people, what\u2019s on top of mind is the market. Everything is down, everything across the board is down. A lot of people are doing flat rounds, or some raise money, or if you\u2019re a founder, you\u2019re dealing with laying people off. And so, you folks have been through a lot of market cycles, been through all of it yourself with your own company. For people here that are kind of dealing with this, and maybe having sometimes a really tough time, how do you think they should approach it from a mindset perspective? What advice would you have for them? Maybe Marc can go first.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Marc:</strong> Sean Parker had the best quote of all time, and I\u2019ll just prepare you ahead of time, audiences hate this quote. So, I\u2019ll just prepare you for that. Sean Parker had the best comment on what it\u2019s like to be a startup founder. He said, \u201cBeing a startup founder is like chewing glass. Eventually, you start to like the taste of your own blood.\u201d And it always gets this exact reaction.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Ari:</strong> That\u2019s true, though.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Marc:</strong> And he\u2019s right. It is brutally difficult. And I actually think it\u2019s\u2026we live in a culture in which people have\u2026popular culture, it\u2019s very positive interpretations of how incredible it is to be a founder. And then there\u2019s all these negative kind of hit pieces and so forth. And then there\u2019s just kind of the reality in the middle. And the reality in the middle is just it\u2019s always really hard. There\u2019s always a lot of really hard things going on. And then there\u2019s also\u2026I kind of rail on this a little bit. There\u2019s this\u2026in the Valley in particular, there\u2019s this kind of fail fast kind of culture, kind of when something\u2019s not working, give up quickly. And that makes a little bit of sense in certain circumstances. But by and large, it\u2019s kind of the opposite advice. You tend to find the great founders following, which basically is like when the going gets hard, the answer generally is just work harder and fight it harder.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Ari:</strong> That\u2019s true in entertainment too. I mean, Greg Daniels created \u201cThe Office.\u201d Jeff Zucker, he did six episodes. Jeff Zucker said\u2026 And usually after 6 episodes, you get 22 episodes. You kind of go in the mid\u2026at the time, you went into the mid-season pick up, and then you get 13 or you get 22. And Jeff Zucker calls him up and he said, \u201cI\u2019m just going to give you six episodes.\u201d And he lost his mind, and he thought he\u2019d failed. And he\u2019s one of the great writers. And I said to him, \u201cJust stay in the ring.\u201d He goes, \u201cI\u2019m not doing six episodes.\u201d I said, \u201cLet\u2019s just do six episodes and see what happens.\u201d And six episodes led to the season of \u201cThe Office.\u201d And the same thing is true with \u201cSeinfeld\u201d and Larry David, who I represent. I mean, that\u2019s just what it takes. You just have to stay in the ring, take the beating, and just keep on going.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">There\u2019s plenty of times in my life when that happened at the firm, partner was stealing from me. We had no money, went into the bank account, paid all the employees, and didn\u2019t think we were going to make it to the next day. And that\u2019s just what\u2026I started to enjoy my own blood.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Marc:</strong> So, you wrote \u201cSeinfeld,\u201d and then obviously Curb. \u201cSeinfeld\u201d was a huge hit right out of the gate. Is that how it went?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Ari:</strong> No.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Marc:</strong> No?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Ari:</strong> So, it was on I want to say Wednesday, when they put it up, and you deal with your testing. It said, \u201cThis is about nothing.\u201d And the first six episodes, didn\u2019t work. Brandon Tartikoff was in the hospital, had leukemia. His first bout.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Marc:</strong> This is the executive who sponsored.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Ari:</strong> Yeah. He was the head of NBC.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Marc:</strong> Sort of guy who was protecting it.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Ari:</strong> And he then saw the episodes and he said, \u201cLet\u2019s put the reruns on Thursday night behind \u2018Friends.'\u201d And then the ratings went up. They then ordered 13 episodes. They wanted to\u2026I\u2019m going to script this. But there was a problem with Larry David because he didn\u2019t want to listen to their notes. They brought somebody in. That man gave up his points because he said, \u201cThis show goes nowhere.\u201d Gave up\u2026I think it was 15 points, which was\u2026</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Marc:</strong> On \u201cSeinfeld.\u201d A lot of money.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Ari:</strong> And he took for the 15 points, I think, $250,000. The story\u2019s probably wrong, $250,000. And they are worth now hundreds of millions of dollars. And they then put it on Thursday night, huge hit.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Marc</strong>: But very tenuous at the beginning.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Ari:</strong> Oh, my God.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Marc:</strong> Even \u201cSeinfeld\u201d\u2026</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Ari:</strong> Oh, yeah. It was about nothing.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Marc:</strong> Right. So, you go back in. And by the way, the same thing with a lot of these big successful companies in the very beginning. Well, the other thing that just gets buried in the history is you can sometimes get it out, but the other thing that gets buried in history is this, for each of the great tech companies, there were almost always moments where they would have or almost did actually sell the company very, very, very early on.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Ari:</strong> Really.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Marc:</strong> And some of these stories are very famous. You\u2019ve heard a number of these stories. Netflix almost sold to Blockbuster. They were all these kind of points in time where\u2026</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Sriram:</strong> Facebook to Yahoo.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Marc:</strong> Well, Facebook\u2026</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Ari:</strong> Well, Netflix got lucky because Blockbuster and Viacom, because he owned a big chunk of it, had so much\u2026put so much debt on it. And they were about\u2026they had all the digital rights. They just couldn\u2019t afford it. And Viacom ran into all the trouble, and they were splitting the company up and everything else like that.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Marc:</strong> Facebook actually sold to Yahoo. They actually had a completed a deal.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Sriram:</strong> Really?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Marc:</strong> Yeah. They actually had a completed deal. They had a completed deal at $1 billion. And then the CEO of Yahoo at the time.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Sriram:</strong> Terry</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Ari:</strong> Semel.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Marc:</strong> The financial crisis hit and Yahoo reduced the price. And that gave Mark the latitude, because he obviously needed to adjust for the down market. And that gave Mark the latitude to walk away. And actually, the other funny part of that story is\u2026</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Ari:</strong> That\u2019s crazy.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Marc:</strong> \u2026at that time\u2026 It\u2019s even crazier. At that time, the internal Yahoo deal back on buying Facebook, this is 2008, actually leaked to the press.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Sriram:</strong> It\u2019s very public, you can still find it online.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Marc:</strong> It\u2019s actually right on TechCrunch. You can google it, you can find it. And so, it\u2019s the internal Yahoo projections for Facebook\u2019s future earnings stream.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Ari:</strong> What did it say?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Marc:</strong> And the overwhelming reaction was, \u201cThat\u2019s insane. Yahoo has lost their mind. There is no way that this thing can ever make that level of money.\u201d And of course, it undershot ultimately by 100x.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Ari:</strong> You know what\u2026</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Marc:</strong> Yahoo was being crazily conservative in retrospect.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Ari:</strong> You know what the value of at the time when Disney bought Cap Cities ABC, what they valued ESPN at?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Marc:</strong> Mm-mm.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Ari:</strong> Zero.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Marc:</strong> Zero.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Ari:</strong> It was at the time before linear and cable went to nothing. It was at the height probably worth $100 billion, $50 billion.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Marc:</strong> There was a theory there that it\u2026was it just not far enough long, or was the theory that watching it\u2026keeping shows about sports\u2026</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Ari:</strong> Yeah, exactly. It wasn\u2019t far enough long, and who is going to pay for sports?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Marc:</strong> So, these things\u2026anyway, the point of the story is, these things are super tenuous up front. Success is not\u2026it\u2019s almost never the case that it\u2019s like, \u201cOkay, this thing is going to be a slam dunk success, and then it\u2019s a slam dunk success.\u201d It\u2019s almost always just a continuous fight against people who just literally don\u2019t believe.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Sriram:</strong> And the interesting thing about the Facebook story, and this is very public now, is that a lot of the Facebook exec team at the time were not happy with not selling to Yahoo. They really wanted to sell.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Marc:</strong> Enough time has passed, people have talked about this. One hundred percent of the Facebook executive team at that time wanted to sell, except for Mark.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Ari:</strong> Really?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Marc:</strong> Yeah, it was overwhelming inside the company.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Ari: I mean, my story is we start the company. Three months in, I\u2019m going to say a bad name now, so I get called into Harvey Weinstein\u2019s hotel room. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">With my three partners at the time. The four chairs are there. And he says, \u201cI\u2019ve made a deal for you to go to William Morris. They\u2019re going to pay each one of you $2.5 million.\u201d Well, we had no money. I wasn\u2019t taking a salary. We were getting sued. It was a disaster. \u201cAnd you\u2019ll go over there and they\u2019ll buy the company.\u201d Asshole me says to him, \u201cWhat are you fucking talking about? I\u2019m going to buy them one day.\u201d Cut to 15 years later.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Marc:</strong> Did all the people you were in the room with that day hang with you?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Ari:</strong> Except one left at the merger. And we merged/took them over.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Sriram:</strong> Okay, all right. So, okay, we\u2019re almost out of time. I\u2019m going to ask one last thing to both of you. And I know both of you hate this, but I\u2019m going to ask this anyway. So, I\u2019m going to start with you, Mark. What is one thing over the many, many years you\u2019ve known Ari that you learned from Ari? And then vise versa, but we\u2019ll start with you.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Marc:</strong> Well, look, Nietzsche has this thing, will to power. And so, I think that would be my\u2026just like\u2026and you\u2019ve seen it demonstrated in the stories today, which is it\u2019s an overwhelming determination to get to the objective, and to not let\u2026 Another way to describe it is Ari leaves an Ari Emanuel-shaped hole in any brick wall he endeavors, including calendar, my\u2026 And so, yeah, just at the end of the day, there is no substitute for sheer willpower and determination, and I think he has a lot to teach about that.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Ari:</strong> Definitely that phone calls are not as important.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Sriram:</strong> Oh, come on, come on. Give us something real.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Ari:</strong> No, listen, he\u2019s built one of the\u2026we actually were just talking about this at lunch at his house. He\u2019s built a company that he\u2019s realized\u2026he continues to shift how he thinks about the world. And he\u2019s constantly curious about things that are happening in the world. And his capacity, and I think I have a pretty big capacity, it\u2019s not even close to his, to absorb all these different worlds, and then take things from them, and then incorporate into his business is extraordinary.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">On that note, this has been\u2026</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Ari:</strong> Thank you.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Sriram:</strong> \u2026amazing. </span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\">***</p>\n<p><i>The above transcript is abridged and edited for clarity.</i></p>\n<p><i>The views expressed here are those of the individual AH Capital Management, L.L.C.

The act provides more than $500 billion for the Paycheck Protection Program, or PPP, a low-interest, forgivable loan program designed to help small businesses and self-employed individuals retain workers and stay afloat during the pandemic. Since March, the Small Business Administration has approved billions of dollars in PPP loans. But it is also estimated that U.S. losses from coronavirus-related fraud and identity theft have reached almost $100 million. According to the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/28/business/ppp-small-business-fraud-coronavirus.html\"><i>New York Times</i></a>, the Small Business Administration\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fraud hotline has received 42,000 reports about coronavirus-related cheating and misuse; by comparison, last year it had less than 800.</p>\n<p>To date, the Department of Justice has charged more than 40 cases of PPP-related schemes, from claiming non-existent employees or non-existent businesses to identity theft, kickback schemes, fake tax documents, and multi-state fraud rings. Most of those cases have alleged fraud of more than a $1 million. But what about the countless others that may be cheating taxpayers out of smaller\u00e2\u0080\u0094but not insignificant\u00e2\u0080\u0094sums? How does the government decide who should get money and who shouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t among millions of applications from businesses of all industries and sizes\u00e2\u0080\u0094and what role do banks play? How does the program then distribute that money quickly and accurately\u00e2\u0080\u0094or not, in many cases? And what tools are at our disposal to catch those who cheat the system?</p>\n<p>Host <a href=\"https://a16z.com/author/lauren-murrow/\">Lauren Murrow</a> is joined by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BharatRamamurti\">Bharat Ramamurti</a>, the original member of the COVID-19 Congressional Oversight Commission, which is tasked with evaluating the impact of coronavirus relief loans; <a href=\"https://twitter.com/naftaliharris\">Naftali Harris</a>, the CEO of <a href=\"https://sentilink.com/\">SentiLink</a>, a software company that builds technology to detect synthetic fraud; and a16z fintech general partner <a href=\"https://a16z.com/author/alex-rampell/\">Alex Rampell</a>.</p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Transcript:\u00c2\u00a0</span></h2>\n<p><strong>Lauren Murrow (a16z)</strong>: The potential for fraud was a concern from the beginning. All the way back on March 16<sup>th</sup>, before the CARES Act was signed, Attorney General Barr directed U.S. Attorney\u2019s offices to prioritize investigating and prosecuting PPP loan fraud cases. But how prevalent is fraud in the program thus far?</p>\n<p><strong>Bharat Ramamurti (member of the COVID-19 Congressional Oversight Commission)</strong>: We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re still trying to analyze that that. There have been some prosecutions on PPP, but that\u2019s obviously not the full universe of fraud. I think one issue that\u2019s come up already is transparency. A good way of detecting fraud is to make sure that every single borrower through the PPP program is publicly disclosed. But the government is not doing that. They\u2019re only disclosing recipients of loans above $150,000. And something like 80 percent of recipients had loans under that amount. So at the moment, we only know 20 percent of the companies who got money through this program, which is a serious issue.</p>\n<p><strong>Naftali Harris (CEO of SentiLink):</strong> Well, Bharat, from our perspective, we appreciate the fact that you were able to get at least some of the loans publicized because, my firm has actually gone through some of them. And even with the very limited data that\u2019s available, we found some pretty clear instances of fraud, which we\u2019ve escalated to the banks that actually issued the loans. There\u2019s not too much you can do with more limited information that\u2019s available.</p>\n<p><strong>Bharat</strong>: It\u2019s really important to track what these companies are doing with the money. And I think a big part of what the Oversight Commission should do and will be doing is scrutinizing the companies that get money through these programs to evaluate how that money is flowing thereafter.</p>\n<p><strong>Lauren</strong>: Alex, after the stimulus package passed back in March, <a href=\"https://a16z.com/2020/03/31/stimulus-depends-on-fintech/\">you wrote this op-ed</a> that argued, I\u2019ll quote, \u201cThe last mile of identifying, adjudicating, and dispersing assistance without a sea of fraud is a new challenge, one which the government is wholly unprepared for, and for which technology is the needed answer.\u201d It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s now been nearly five months. Do you stand by that assessment?</p>\n<p><strong>Alex Rampell (a16z general partner): </strong>I do, unfortunately. I mean, there\u2019s no time machine. If there was, I would do many things with my new piece of technology.</p>\n<p>The only way of explaining this whole process really is as a very, very complex, worst way to do it, in my personal opinion, Rube Goldberg machine. And it took such a long time for many businesses to actually apply and figure all of this out, and their bank couldn\u2019t do it. And, of course, somebody like some giant burger chain got the PPP loan and not the 10 businesses that really needed it. A lot of businesses have failed. And I think it\u2019s terrible.</p>\n<p><strong>Lauren</strong>: The Small Businesses Administration then started accepting loan applications just a week after the CARES Act passed. And that pace, as you mentioned, raised some concerns. For one, to help quickly disperse those funds\u00e2\u0080\u0094which, of course, speed was essential\u00e2\u0080\u0094the SBA allowed lenders to rely on borrower certifications to determine their eligibility. Was that a mistake?</p>\n<p><strong>Alex</strong>: That\u2019s not how I would have done it. I think there was a little bit of a disconnect in terms of the people that set the policy, the speed at which the policy needed, in all fairness, to get rolled out, and then the level of technical understanding in terms of how the financial system works in 2020 with a lot of tools that have been developed, frankly, in the last 5 or 10 years.</p>\n<p>But just to walk through what I meant by that, what does identify mean? Well, if you\u2019re born in this country and you\u2019re a U.S. citizen, you\u2019ve got a Social Security Number. And you might think that every business has a Federal Employer Identification Number, which would be the equivalent, but what about sole proprietorships? Or what about people that just use an illegally fictitious name for their own quasi business? There\u2019s not really a way of identifying them. There\u2019s not really a way of knowing what their income was before coronavirus. And, after coronavirus, how much of an impact that actually had.</p>\n<p>Like, you\u2019ll say that you\u2019re self-employed, but there\u2019s not really knowledge that you have this business. So you\u2019re one of the 30 million small businesses in America, but it\u2019s just not really known as an entity to the government.</p>\n<p><strong>Naftali</strong>: The PPP really shined a light on how bad identity verification is in the United States. In addition to really not knowing who the people are or who the businesses are, if you look at the applications themselves and look at who\u2019s on payroll, really no good way of verifying that. And I think if the United States was able to know who citizens are, and if there\u2019s a way of identifying them, this whole system would have been a lot easier to run.</p>\n<p><strong>Lauren</strong>: How could that improve?</p>\n<p><strong>Naftali</strong>: If you look at other countries like India or like Estonia, the government actually takes a very active role in identifying its citizens. In India, they have the Aadhaar system. In Estonia, they have government-issued IDs which even have public-key cryptography on them. And so, in the same way that you can give everyone a bank account, you could also give every citizen in the United States or every business, public and private, key pairs and actually allow them to verify their identities that way. If you did that, you can even prove that an individual actually was on payroll at a given company.</p>\n<p><strong>Alex</strong>: I think the way to have done it is to say, \u201cLet\u2019s get your banking information.\u201d And there\u2019s a way of doing that, because there\u2019s a company called Plaid where if you go sign up for a mint account, or if you go sign up for any kind of account online, it asks for your banking credentials from your current bank so that it can import all of the data. It\u2019s an API, an application programming interface, to go read that information from the bank. It really is effectively as close as you can get to a certified copy of the financials.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s much, much harder to somehow falsify information that is actually coming directly from your bank, coming directly from your credit card processor, or coming directly from your payroll company. And the great thing about 2020 is that there are APIs largely through companies like Plaid that allow that to happen.</p>\n<p>And I just feel like PPP it was done in arguably the worst way possible because you\u00e2\u0080\u0099d go to the SBA website and it would say, \u201cOkay, to find a lender that can give you a PPP loan, enter your zip code.\u201d You\u2019d enter in your zip code, and no matter what zip code you entered, it would give you 56,000 results. As a small business, you\u2019d go to bank A and they\u2019d say, \u201cSorry, we can\u2019t help you.\u201d So then you went to bank C, bank D, bank E, bank F, and then you actually applied 10 times not out of fraud, but because you need the money, so you don\u2019t have to lay off all of your employees and declare bankruptcy.</p>\n<p><strong>Lauren</strong>: Bharat, do you agree with that assessment?</p>\n<p><strong>Bharat</strong>: Yeah, I agree. And I think it goes back to the original policy choice that Congress made when this crisis hit. I like to point to Denmark, which took a different approach. Denmark said, \u201cRegardless of how big your business is, if you are taking a hit from all these public health restrictions, we will step in and cover a significant percentage of your payroll costs. And you look at the result of that: In Denmark, the unemployment rate was about 4 percent before the crisis and it peaked at about 5 percent.</p>\n<p>In the U.S., it jumped from 4 percent to about 20 percent. And it\u2019s still in double digits as of today. And as Alex said, a lot of companies have payroll processors that have this information handy in order to feed the money into the right places. The government could have partnered with those companies to make sure that the money was distributed. You could have done something through the IRS, which is an idea that Congress is currently looking at.</p>\n<p><strong>Alex</strong>: I totally agree that other countries have done this better than we have, on the how do they handle their economic woes. And if we just said, \u201cAll right, here\u2019s what we\u2019re going to do. We\u2019re just going to support people on payroll not for an arbitrary two and a half months, but we\u2019re going to support them for an indefinite period of time, provided that sales for the business are below some percentage of baseline,\u201d maybe that\u2019s a better way of doing it.</p>\n<p><strong>Bharat</strong>: I think that that original decision by Congress to treat companies of different sizes differently, and to send them money for different things, created a lot of the complexity that we\u2019re seeing now.</p>\n<p><strong>Alex</strong>: I largely agree with that. If you look at a company like Amazon that\u2019s grown into the pandemic, arguably they don\u2019t need any help supporting employment. But this is the this is where you get information from the financial statements of a company, whether it\u2019s public or private. Because I totally agree with you, there\u2019s a lot of: \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis company shouldn\u2019t be getting a Paycheck Protection loan because they\u2019re rich.\u00e2\u0080\u009d But it\u2019s like, yeah, but if their sales are down by 90 percent and they\u2019re going to fire 90 percent of their workers, how would you feel if you\u2019re a worker where you pick the wrong company to work at, and therefore that\u2019s why you\u2019re losing your job?</p>\n<p>So, I think you actually could have threaded the needle on this, which is to not base it on employment, but to base it on: Were your sales impacted? Basically, there were companies that saw massive decreases in sales. And I think the most unfortunate thing about this entire situation is the government did end up picking winners and losers, where mom-and-pop retail just got eviscerated. And Target just announced their best quarter ever. It\u2019s like this giant transfer of wealth from a lot of small businesses to large businesses. If more money is going into your bank account after COVID than before COVID, that\u2019s a pretty good hint that you probably shouldn\u2019t be getting any kind of assistance from the government.</p>\n<p><strong>Bharat</strong>: Alternatively, what you could have done at the beginning when maybe you don\u2019t have a sense of which companies were going to benefit and which ones weren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t, is that you just get the money out the door quickly to everybody and then you can recoup it on the back end, on 2020 taxes, which are collected in 2021.</p>\n<p>But I think the larger point stands, which is that if you care about helping workers, then you shouldn\u2019t really care about whether that worker happens to work at a really big company or a really small company. And I think that the congressional response resulted in very different outcomes for different types of workers and different types of businesses based on factors that I think aren\u2019t really relevant.</p>\n<p><strong>Lauren</strong>: In addition to the application process, one aspect that seemed to pose a particular challenge was the disbursement. To give one example, the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration found that as of April 30th, nearly $1.4 billion had mistakenly gone to descendants. How might the disbursement piece have been done differently?</p>\n<p><strong>Alex</strong>: The government has never had an organ where it\u2019s like, \u201cWe need to send money to people.\u201d I think in a future world, if you were building a nation state from scratch, you\u2019d probably just have your Social Security Number also be a bank account. Where if I, as the government, wanted to give everybody money, I could just push a button, and then boom, it gets deposited into the government bank account. Because you\u2019re already paying the government anyway.</p>\n<p>You know, my idea would be: every citizen should have some direct channel of actually both sending money to the government and receiving money from the government, which would ideally be some kind of quasi-government bank account.</p>\n<p><strong>Bharat</strong>: That is a proposal that is working its way through Congress. A number of Democrats support an idea called Fed Account where every person and every business would automatically have an account at the Federal Reserve, like banks have now. It\u2019s a way of sending money out to individuals and businesses very quickly. But I think we\u2019ve seen now that there are significant costs to not having that ability both for businesses and individuals.</p>\n<p><strong>Alex</strong>: The problem with the disbursement in many cases was that you\u2019d apply with 20 banks, not because you wanted to apply with 20 banks, not because you wanted to cheat the government and get 20 loans, you just had no idea if you were going to get your money in time.</p>\n<p>Because many big banks just don\u2019t do SBA loans. Before this happened, the largest bank by count of SBA loans per quarter was Wells Fargo, which did 692 loans in the quarter before COVID hit. And now we have 30 million small businesses in this country, many of which are going out of business. The SBA just isn\u2019t set up for this. And it was so complicated, partially because the government didn\u2019t want to be in the business of picking winners and losers in terms of, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis bank is competent, this bank is not competent.\u00e2\u0080\u009d They just said, \u201cHere\u2019s every bank, we\u2019re going to let the private market figure this out.\u201d</p>\n<p>My proposal would have been\u00e2\u0080\u0094every business now accepts credit cards. So the credit card processing company now has a pretty good idea of what your sales are. Most companies use an electronic payroll system, so they have a login for paychecks, or ADP, or Gusto. And most businesses also use QuickBooks or some kind of online accounting system. So to identify them, to adjudicate them, and to disperse with much lower fraud, there are tools to do this. But the tool is not either a community bank or Citibank. That was the worst organ for disbursement.</p>\n<p><strong>Bharat</strong>: I agree with a lot of that. And had similar critiques of the PPP program as they were still trying to think through how to design it. Number one, because it operated through banks, and the way that the bank regulations work, there\u2019s a significant incentive for banks to cater to their existing customers first. Which meant that companies that had an existing small business relationship with a bank were put at the front of the line. But for a lot of small businesses who may not have that kind of existing relationship with the bank, they did not get the loan that they needed. And a lot of minority-owned small businesses are in that category. And that\u2019s why you\u2019ve seen this highly disparate racial impact when it comes to small business closures.</p>\n<p><strong>Alex</strong>: I would differ on this correlation of which people got the loans quickly versus not quickly. There was this just kind of like randomness around which bank you worked with. A lot of it was just this crapshoot: if you happen to bank with a bank that knew what they were doing. And a lot of members of Congress were like, \u201cOh, see, it\u2019s the local and community banks that knew what they were doing.\u201d But actually, think about the old-fashioned way of making a car, where somebody would assemble it by hand, and the new-fashioned way of doing it, which is an assembly line. These big banks are assembly lines and the small banks are effectively doing things by hand.</p>\n<p>And it turned out, in the early weeks of this, the small banks were a lot more effective than the big banks. And that was really what caused this disparity. It\u2019s like, if you happen to be in the assembly line bank, you were screwed. And then you had to scramble to go find a local, do-it-yourself handyman bank.</p>\n<p><strong>Bharat</strong>: Yes, on that last point, there\u2019s a lot of good PPP data by state, and you\u2019ll notice that the state that was the most successful at getting PPP loans to businesses was North Dakota. And North Dakota is the only state in the country that has its own state-run bank. And so, it\u2019s another data point in support of building out our public infrastructure in terms of delivering money to people and to businesses.</p>\n<p><strong>Naftali</strong>: Some organizations were very excited about this. \u201cThis is free money from the government, let\u2019s pass out as many of these PPP loans as we possibly can and collect some money that we have no risk in.\u201d And others were, I think, a lot more conservative and said, \u201cYou know what, this is a new program. I\u2019m not even sure we want to do this at all.\u201d And only based on significant pressure from their customers did they even do this. And so, you ended up with a very uneven patchwork approach and very uneven experiences for different small businesses.</p>\n<p><strong>Alex</strong>: There\u2019s always this rule in anything where you\u2019re allowing transactions, which is the best way of stopping all fraud is to stop all transactions. And when you need to move quickly to stop businesses from failing, which was the debacle that we were in and, unfortunately, still are in, you\u2019re going to let more erroneous or fraudulent transactions through. It\u2019s inevitable.</p>\n<p><strong>Lauren</strong>: Right. To that point, there are many different means of fraud. So, some who have been charged have claimed non-existent employees or misrepresented the number of employees. Others claimed non-existent businesses. Some submitted forged bank statements or used to fake tax documents. There was a software engineer who created fake tech companies to obtain over a million dollars in funds. We\u2019ve had several instances of kickback schemes. And there was a pretty well-publicized PPP fraud ring in which five people from three different states were paying each other for services that were never rendered. Naftali, in a program of this scale, what methods of fraud are you most concerned about here? And what are the tools at our disposal to catch these bad actors?</p>\n<p><strong>Naftali</strong>: I have been thinking about this as three different categories of fraud or, put more mildly, misuse of funds. The worst, for sure, is creating totally fictitious businesses and fake employees and just using it to steal money from all of us citizens. That\u2019s one category.</p>\n<p>I think another category is someone that does have a business, they actually are employing people, but they\u2019re misusing the funds that are coming to them. They\u2019re using it to pay themselves a better salary or take money from the loans that they shouldn\u2019t be doing. The last category is about who should really be getting this: Is this business really one that was at risk of going out of business?</p>\n<p>I think the ones that I\u2019m most concerned about are really the ones in that first category. Because that\u2019s where you\u2019re really, really ripping off the government and taxpayers.</p>\n<p><strong>Lauren</strong>: Your company, SentiLink, aims to detect synthetic fraud, which, as you mentioned, is creating a fake person or a fake identity from the ground up. Typically, my understanding is that kind of fraud is coming from more organized crime rings. Is that a concern here?</p>\n<p><strong>Naftali</strong>: Absolutely. And we\u2019ve seen quite a lot of that in the PPP because it\u2019s very helpful, in this case, to be able to have a bunch of fake people that are on payroll, or to have a fake person that you can list as the owner of a business so that nothing will tie back to the fraudster themselves. It\u2019s actually relatively simple to create a synthetic identity. And so, for the PPP, we\u2019ve also seen a lot of lone wolves attacking it, people like that software engineer, for instance.</p>\n<p>I\u2019d also say for the payroll stuff in particular, since there\u2019s very little verification, if any, of the people that are supposed to be on the payroll itself, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a case where it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s even easier. You know, there\u2019s even an indictment we saw where the identities that were used as employees on payroll were actually literally generated online in one of those fictitious name generators. So for a program like this, you really need to have a strong ability to audit it at the back end and prosecute in cases where the government and all of us citizens have been ripped off.</p>\n<p><strong>Lauren</strong>: Right. The DOJ has filed, I think, between 30 and 40 fraud cases [ed: now more than 40]. Most of them are for more than a million dollars.</p>\n<p><strong>Naftali</strong>: My personal favorite is the guy with the Lamborghini.</p>\n<p><strong>Lauren</strong>: Describe.</p>\n<p><strong>Naftali</strong>: Oh, It\u2019s a really great indictment. Essentially, some guy has this lame business he claims has like 107 employees, which is patently not true. He gets the money and immediately uses it for, I think, a Lamborghini, and a diamond watch, and a whole bunch of crazy stuff. But my favorite part of this whole indictment is that it ends with: \u00e2\u0080\u009cThese are not approved purposes for PPP loans.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Very understated.</p>\n<p><strong>Lauren</strong>: [laughs] Yeah. Though while those individual headlines are sensational, so far we\u2019ve only heard about, a very minuscule percentage of those funds that have been fraudulent, versus the funds that are going to help small businesses. We don\u2019t know yet.</p>\n<p><strong>Alex</strong>: Well, that\u2019s part of the problem. Fraud is not black or white. I mean, in most cases people think there are good guys, there are bad guys, and the good guys chase the bad guys. But as an example, what if you didn\u2019t buy a Lamborghini? But what if you paid yourself a slightly higher salary than you used to, as the business owner? There\u2019s also something that you certified on the PPP loan application, which was: \u00e2\u0080\u009cThese funds are absolutely necessary for the continued operation of my business.\u00e2\u0080\u009d</p>\n<p>That one\u2019s a little bit more subjective. But I think there\u2019s a whole spectrum of, \u201cI didn\u2019t even need this thing, but I applied for it anyway because why not? Free money from the government never hurt of anybody.\u00e2\u0080\u009d There\u2019s all of these different gradations of, perhaps we shouldn\u2019t throw people in prison kind of fraud like we should the Lamborghini guy, but this is not being used as was intended. It certainly didn\u2019t meet the spirit of the law, and it certainly didn\u2019t meet the letter of the law. How much of that is going on? Or: I wanted to try to hire back all of these employees, but I can\u2019t.</p>\n<p><strong>Lauren</strong>: Right. And more than 85 percent of the loans issued were for under $150,000. So, arguably, the speed and the scale of the PPP program means we\u2019re likely dealing with much more fraud than usual, but it\u2019s not necessarily the usual fraudsters. It could be\u00e2\u0080\u0094according to the cases charged thus far\u00e2\u0080\u0094a woman with an Etsy store, or a guy who runs an auto body shop, or someone who just takes the money and spends it at a casino. So, are we missing the smaller schemes because of the need to actually get this money out quickly? Does it matter?</p>\n<p><strong>Naftali</strong>: You know, I\u2019ll tell you, we\u2019ve been helping some of the organizations process some of the smaller loans. Not for every PPP lender out there, but for a subset of them. And we\u2019ve certainly seen a lot of fraud in that smaller dollar range. To your point, it\u2019s around $100,000 or so, not so huge that it would be triggering huge alarm bells, but also not so small that it\u2019s not really worth their time. And the number of fraud attempts that we\u2019re seeing has actually been pretty significant.</p>\n<p><strong>Alex</strong>: We\u2019re not going to know for a while. Because you have to kind of play the game theory here. Right now, these are loans and there\u2019s an application to apply for forgiveness of the loan. Now, if you\u2019re a criminal and you already bought a private jet with all your PPP proceeds and put your Lamborghinis on the jet, and fled to some country that doesn\u2019t extradite to the U.S., would you apply for forgiveness for all the loans? No, of course not.</p>\n<p>So ironically, the companies that plan on surviving, that apply for forgiveness, I would argue are going to be that second tier of fraud. The actual, abject criminals that created fake businesses that don\u2019t exist, that already got the money and ran off with it, they\u2019re not going to apply for forgiveness or anything. And the SBA is going to be on the hook to reimburse the banks and the banks try to collect on that money. So I think you\u2019re going to know once the applications for forgiveness start coming through, and the announcements by the bank to go claim money from the SBA from businesses that defaulted, and, by the way, that have been completely non-responsive to any kind of collections effort.</p>\n<p><strong>Lauren</strong>: Yes, I do want to talk about that question of loan forgiveness. In order to get Paycheck Protection loans forgiven, meaning you don\u2019t have to repay the money, small business owners have to show proof that at least 60 percent of the money was used for payroll. They have to rehire and retain workers at the same salary levels. So, there\u2019s currently a proposal in Congress for automatic forgiveness of loans that are $150,000 and under. Basically, it requires the borrower to say, \u201cYep, I used it like I was supposed to.\u201d Some critics say that there\u2019s not enough information available yet to say whether the program is actually working to save jobs, and that by easing forgiveness requirements you could potentially heighten the risk of fraud. Bharat, what\u2019s your perspective?</p>\n<p><strong>Bharat</strong>: Yes, I share the concerns that you mentioned about that. As I noted before, they\u2019re not disclosing the names of companies that received under $150,000. And what is the level under which you get automatic forgiveness? It\u2019s $150,000. So that seems to be a troubling overlap. I think, at a minimum, you should be publicly disclosing the names of all these companies before you do blanket forgiveness for that set of companies.</p>\n<p>Second of all, look, I am I\u2019m in favor of figuring out ways to minimize the paperwork responsibilities for companies to get loan forgiveness. But there\u2019s an important public policy issue here which is that the money was supposed to go to support payroll and keeping people employed. And if companies ended up not using the money for that purpose, then I don\u2019t think that they should be getting their loans forgiven. And so I think it\u2019s important to verify that that actually happened. And the only way to do that, I think, is to require them to jump through at least some hoops before the loans are forgiven.</p>\n<p><strong>Lauren</strong>: I\u2019d like to talk about how we might potentially improve this, as additional stimulus measures are passed and extended. One issue in detecting and preventing fraud was also the issue of faulty data. SBA data showed that many companies claimed to have retained more workers than they actually had, in some cases not by the fault of the business owner. The analysis also showed that for more than 875,000 borrowers, zero jobs were supported, or no information was listed. Bloomberg reported data that at least a quarter of a million dollars may have listed the wrong location for the borrowers. How can we improve the data to better assess the success or the shortcomings of this program?</p>\n<p><strong>Alex</strong>: I think there are two things here. My favorite article just took apart the data dump that was provided by Treasury on every single person above $150,000. And Pennsylvania, the state, was spelled like 155 different ways. Because the E-Tran system for processing these loans was just not very good, business owners did not have access to it directly. So they filled out a PDF, sent it to the bank, and then it got transcribed. And then the information was wrong, but as long as you got an ICHRA number on the other side then the bank would disperse the money, knowing that if the business failed, they\u2019d be made whole.</p>\n<p>So, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d say two things. If you\u2019re a restaurant, and you took a PPP loan, and your sales went down by 70 percent, and they\u2019re still down by 70 percent, it does not make sense to employ any people. That\u2019s part of the problem; that would not be a case of fraud. The thing that\u2019s missing from that data, my point, is what the sales have been. We just don\u2019t have the data on how the businesses have performed, except in aggregate.</p>\n<p><strong>Bharat</strong>: Just a slightly different point, one of the things that I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve found in government is that simplicity is probably the biggest virtue. When we\u2019re trying to figure out how to design a program, I would say that the simpler the program, the easier it is for businesses to comply with it, the easier it is to get good data on it, the easier it is to monitor compliance, the easier it is to enforce whatever the rules are of that program. And my other rule would be: when in doubt, make sure you\u2019re being over-inclusive rather than under-inclusive. Okay, so maybe some businesses get money that you don\u2019t think should get money at the margins. To me, that is a small price to pay for, number one, getting money out quickly. And number two, making sure that companies that do need the money are getting it.</p>\n<p>And so, I think that on those two metrics, the congressional response so far has been fairly shaky, in that, if the goal is to make sure that businesses get money in order to keep people employed, there are about 10 different ways of doing that more directly than the one that Congress chose. And the result is that we\u2019re going to have to collect a lot more data and there\u2019s just a lot more opportunities for people to slip through the cracks and for fraud to occur because we created all these intermediaries and we created all these different hoops you have to jump through.</p>\n<p>And so, as a result, you create all sorts of weird incentives and outcomes for companies where there may not be a way of getting people to come back. Like, what if all of their employees have childcare problems and they can\u2019t work right now because they can\u2019t leave the home? And so, when you have a country of 300 million-plus people, and however many businesses, there\u2019s always going to be edge cases that opponents of the program are going to seize on to say this was a bad idea. But at the end of the day, the goal is to get the most help to the most people as quickly as possible. And I think doing things as simply as possible is the key. And I think learning from this experience, to develop basic infrastructure so that you can deliver relief more effectively in the future, is also really important.</p>\n<p><strong>Lauren</strong>: Well, to your point, we\u2019re talking about potential improvements here. But the current administration says that 51 million jobs have been \u201csupported\u201d by the Paycheck Protection Program. The program has been credited with driving down the unemployment rate. Is it cynical to focus on fraud, which, as we discussed, may be limited, when in fact, we should be celebrating the program\u2019s success thus far?</p>\n<p><strong>Alex</strong>: I mean, look, if a business has had sales go down by 50 percent and they got a loan that was basically handling two and a half months of payroll, and we\u2019re in month five of this, it just seems like a very hard to believe claim. So I think actually the claim itself should be investigated and not just taken at face value.</p>\n<p><strong>Bharat</strong>: You know, I would say on PPP, I\u2019m deeply skeptical of the number that came out of the administration. David Autor, a professor at MIT, did an independent analysis of PPP. He found that there was a pretty wide range when it came to the cost per job saved through this program. But the median amount, or the middle of his range, was about $200,000 per job. Which, frankly, isn\u2019t that great. And I think this speaks to both flaws in the design of the program and inefficiency in delivering the money to the companies that that really needed it.</p>\n<p>And, of course, that that also doesn\u2019t account for the cost of potentially allowing tens of thousands of businesses that could have qualified for PPP to fail because we were unable to locate them and provide them with money in time.</p>\n<p><strong>Naftali</strong>: One thing that I\u2019ve made a point to do is when I get takeout or go to a small business, I\u2019ll ask, \u201cHey, did you apply for the PPP?\u201d And more often than not, they\u2019ll say, \u201cNo, I didn\u2019t. I don\u2019t want to have a loan like that,\u201d or \u201cI didn\u2019t know how to complete it,\u201d And that\u2019s a huge shame. And I just hope that the next time that we do this, if we have to do it, we\u2019ll be able to serve those deserving businesses.</p>\n<p>I think if you look at the spectrum between \u00e2\u0080\u0098let\u2019s lock down this money as well as possible and make sure it only goes to the most deserving businesses\u00e2\u0080\u0099 as opposed to [inviting] fraud, the program was skewed towards the \u00e2\u0080\u0098let\u2019s give out money more quickly.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 And I think that was the right thing to do. But on the flip side, it\u2019s taxpayer dollars that all Americans have worked hard for and given to the government.</p>\n<p>And the fact is that I don\u2019t think limiting fraud or finding the fraudsters is all that challenging or all that expensive to do. And so even if the amount of fraud is limited, I still think that from a matter of morality, we as a society should go after the people that have stolen money from deserving businesses.</p>\n<p><strong>Bharat</strong>: I totally agree with that. I think that it\u2019s totally reasonable to focus on fraud. I would just argue that there are other important factors for the government to consider when developing these types of stimulus or relief programs. And that in some cases, there are there are trade-offs where you make choices that could potentially open the door to more fraud, but they have upsides either in terms of speed, or inclusiveness, or whatever the case may be, that that that make it worth it.</p>\n<p>Honestly, I was frustrated after PPP came out and so much of the focus was on a handful of big companies that got money that were essentially shamed into returning it. You know, if they weren\u2019t eligible under the rules of the program that\u2019s one thing, and certainly they should be required to return the money in that case. But there was far more focus on that issue than on the fact that tens of thousands of companies that <em>were</em> eligible weren\u2019t getting the money. And that a disproportionate number of them were owned by black or Hispanic owners because they lacked traditional banking relationships or there weren\u2019t banks participating in the program in their area. That, to me, is a much bigger tragedy than a couple of burger chains getting money they shouldn\u2019t have.</p>\n<p><strong>Lauren</strong>: So, you\u2019re effectively saying some fraud is price we have to pay for getting people the aid that they need in a short period of time.</p>\n<p><strong>Bharat</strong>: Yeah. I would say that there is a trade-off between efficiency, inclusiveness, and potential fraud. Now, you can solve the fraud on the back end by identifying cases of it and bringing enforcement actions to cut down on that or to hold people accountable. And I\u2019m all for that. but I find that what happens more often than not in government is that this idea that \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe most important thing is making sure that people who don\u2019t deserve the money don\u2019t get it\u00e2\u0080\u009d leads to all sorts of terrible policy designs and outcomes that have much greater harm than, you know, some small group of people getting money that we think aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t deserving.</p>\n<p><strong>Lauren</strong>: Naftali, you mentioned it\u2019s not that challenging to catch this type of fraud, particularly in the first category, which was people who are claiming non-existent employees or misrepresenting their number of employees. How can we do this better?</p>\n<p><strong>Naftali</strong>: I think we should have, in addition to private banks or other lenders checking for fraud, uniform checks that are done by the SBA themselves. There are lots of products in the space to detect various different kinds of fraud, including a uniform check that the beneficial owners are actually real people and who they say they are, that the people listed on payroll actually exist, as well, so that we\u2019re not just at the least common denominator of whichever lender wants to issue the most money as fast as possible.</p>\n<p><strong>Lauren</strong>: We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve talked about how the stimulus is unprecedented. Alex, do you have a perspective on how potentially tech could help detect fraud as additional measures are passed?</p>\n<p><strong>Alex</strong>: Well, we can only do it in the constraints that are provided by the bill that is or is not in existence. There\u2019s a lot of stuff that you can change to better adjudicate what is fraud and what isn\u2019t. I mean, I 100 percent agree with Bharat that focusing on this kind of \u00e2\u0080\u009cenvy capitalism\u00e2\u0080\u009d or whatever\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u201dOh, this person got money, they didn\u2019t deserve it. And we should have really made it a one-year process before anybody got money so that not a single cent was wasted.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u0094that itself is so pennywise and pound foolish that it could just topple over the economy. So, that doesn\u2019t make sense.</p>\n<p>But I think the main thing is get data from companies and use that as an automatic adjudication mechanism. And then ideally, just have a disbursement mechanism that comes from not banks but from the government directly rather than paying banks $15 billion to give away the government\u2019s own money, which is the people\u2019s own money.</p>\n<p><strong>Lauren</strong>: Bharat, from your perspective on the Oversight Commission, do you get the sense that in future stimulus measures they\u2019re looking to standardize the process into something that would improve some of these issues?</p>\n<p><strong>Bharat</strong>: So, I think step one is strengthening the authorities that we have. So, for example, we don\u2019t have direct oversight authority of PPP. We don\u2019t have subpoena power to, force people to testify before us or to get documents from other agencies. So, strengthening those oversight authorities would, go a long way towards ensuring that there\u2019s robust, independent, and bipartisan oversight.</p>\n<p>I think that we have learned from the experience of PPP, or Congress has learned and is pushing towards different approaches. So using the tax code to provide direct support to companies without having to go through banks, that\u2019s included in the HEROES Act, which is the bill that the Democrats in the House passed in May. And that\u2019s been sitting in the Senate ever since.</p>\n<p>And I think that there\u2019s been a lot of discussion recently about what data is necessary for full transparency and accountability for these programs. So, the PPP discussion has led to follow on legislation about mandating that every single loan recipient is disclosed, even if they got under $150,000. Mandating, and I think this is critically important, certain demographic data about the nature of recipients, so that we can get harder data about black and Hispanic borrowers, for example, systematically being excluded from this program, either because of purposeful discrimination or because of things like access to traditional banking services. And, if so, is there something additional we should be doing to target those communities?</p>\n<p>So, I think there\u2019s been a lot of congressional interest in strengthening oversight authority, in improving the quality of the data that\u2019s being collected, and in tweaking these programs so that the money is delivered more efficiently.</p>\n<p><strong>Lauren</strong>: Alex, if you were to write your <a href=\"https://a16z.com/2020/03/31/stimulus-depends-on-fintech/\">op-ed</a> again today, what would you adjust based on what you\u2019ve learned over the past five months, since the rollout of the CARES Act?</p>\n<p><strong>Alex</strong>: Honestly, I wouldn\u2019t adjust that much except the duration. So, I still think everything that I wrote, I still stand behind that\u2019s the right way to do it going forward. However, what if this goes on for a year? What\u2019s happened to businesses where, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s still demand, there\u2019s still supply, but the government has said you can\u2019t go there, which has helped Amazon. That\u2019s why you\u2019re having this transfer of wealth from, in some cases, mom-and-pop businesses to big corporations that are able to meet their COVID requirements. Like, say I need to buy Plexiglas to have an ordering station. As a small Mexican restaurant, I can\u2019t do that. But Chipotle can. There are all sorts of kind of winners and losers being created here, which is really fundamentally unfair.</p>\n<p>If this is going to go on for a long time, it\u2019s actually healthy in capitalism to have weak businesses fail. The airlines, should they have gotten bailed out? Maybe, maybe not. But if nobody wants to fly anymore, the answer\u2019s no. If the government stops you from flying, the answer is probably yes. A little bit more nuance than that. So, I think the real question is, if this goes on for a very, very long time, and it\u2019s not just a blip, does it make sense for the government to say, \u201cEverybody\u2019s a winner? And we\u2019re going to protect businesses that weren\u2019t doing a good job before?\u00e2\u0080\u009d</p>\n<p>Because if you look at the restaurant space, a lot of restaurants go bankrupt on their own. So if this plays out for years, should we be on the hook as taxpayers for bailing out everybody who provided bad service to customers? I don\u2019t think anybody would say the answer to that is yes, even if workers will be impacted. But where do you draw the line? And since this has been going on for a much, much longer time now than when I wrote that in March\u00e2\u0080\u0094it was like a stopgap measure. it\u2019s very hard to have a one-year stop measure.</p>\n<p><strong>Lauren</strong>: Thank you all so much for joining us on a16z podcast.</p>\n<p><strong>Alex</strong>: Thank you.</p>\n<p><strong>Bharat</strong>: Thank you.</p>\n<p><strong>Naftali</strong>: Thank you.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00e2\u0080\u0094</p>\n<p><em>The views expressed here are those of the individual AH Capital Management, L.L.C.

And platforms will seek to ease the friction between inspiration \u00e2\u0086\u0092 purchase intent \u00e2\u0086\u0092 and completed purchase. Whether short-form, long-form, or livestream, video is a fantastic way to sell things and teach consumers about a product\u2019s value proposition.

Much of this turmoil has been absorbed by sectors that are operating with legacy tech, such as construction, manufacturing, hospitality, retail, healthcare, and education.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">This creates a massive opportunity for companies that change the way companies hire and retain talent. For businesses, being able to source and vet qualified candidates is more important than ever, especially as most industries don\u2019t have a LinkedIn equivalent. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s likely that in 2023, a new wave of labor marketplaces will help employees build identity and reputation, connect directly with hiring managers, and get training and resources to build their careers.\u00c2\u00a0</span><br/>\n<em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u00e2\u0080\u0094Olivia Moore, partner, consumer team (</span><a href=\"https://twitter.com/omooretweets\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">@omooretweets</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">)</span></em></p>\n<h2><b>Mainstream AI Adoption: More *Fun* Than You Think</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">It often takes a user-first mentality for consumers to adopt the latest tech at scale \u00e2\u0080\u0094 with AR, for example, users picked up on Pok\u00c3\u00a9mon Go and Dog Ear face filters. These products often look like toys, initially: imagine how an AR expert may have felt to learn that one of the most-used applications of the technology would be to put beautification lenses on selfies! The same goes for AI. So many of the latest breakthroughs in AI are about enabling transformation between modalities, whether speech-to-text, text-to-images, or images-to-videos.

This lower absolute dollar spend, coupled with less competition for ads, led to decreases in consumer acquisition costs (CAC). As management teams ramp up in the coming year, we expect consumer companies to pursue B2B partnerships to drive non-inflationary distribution, avoiding the typical Facebook, Instagram, Google, and Apple \u00e2\u0080\u009ctaxes.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Our partner, Joe, recently described this phenomenon as \u00e2\u0080\u009c</span><a href=\"https://a16z.com/2022/11/10/escaping-hells-flywheel-building-non-inflationary-distribution-channels/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">escaping hell\u00e2\u0080\u0099s flywheel</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">.\u00e2\u0080\u009d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">By creating partnerships with set pricing, CACs become more predictable \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and business becomes more sustainable. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve already seen early signs of this, such as Greenlight reaching new families via Chase, Hopper booking trips powering Capital One Travel, and Bilt achieving new card sign-ups through an alliance of residential property managers. We can imagine consumer businesses reaching white-collar employee bases via Gusto and Rippling; gig workers via Uber, Lyft, DoorDash, and Instacart; or young adults via colleges and military organizations.

When dealing with, say, fully automated investment decisions or automatic financial reporting for businesses with complex money flows, companies will need to balance these new services and experiences with potential skepticism from customers.</span><br/>\n<em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u00e2\u0080\u0094Sumeet Singh, partner, fintech team (</span><a href=\"https://twitter.com/sumeet724\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">@sumeet724</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">)</span></em></p>\n<h2><b>FedNow May Be Just the Beginning</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Skeptics of the highly anticipated launch of the </span><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iOBR-eGoxHelfa_Pxfs94yyqQdrGs1BRi-lqevr3yPM/edit#\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Federal Reserve\u00e2\u0080\u0099s real-time payment network, FedNow</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, point to the limited use of the existing networks in the U.S. The one key difference, however, is ownership: RTP and Zelle are owned by consortiums of the largest commercial banks in the U.S. Why will government ownership of a national real-time payment rail make a difference?

Take mobile games: Pok\u00c3\u00a9mon Go was one of the first true mobile-native games, enabled through features unique to smartphones, such as GPS and the integrated camera. Yet its prototype, Ingress, didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t launch until five years after the release of the iPhone in 2007. We can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t rush the product cycle. I believe we\u2019ll see the first web3-native games emerge in the coming years, perhaps sooner than we think.\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In the near term, there are also opportunities to extend existing game genres with open economies. In the past, the next big game often rose from player \u00e2\u0080\u009cmods\u00e2\u0080\u009d like DOTA (League of Legends) or DayZ (PUBG).

Asset types include 2D art, 3D models, textures, sound effects, music, characters, animations, level designs, cinematics, and more. And each of these asset types has its own highly specialized production process, with dedicated tools and artists.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Generative AI today is getting the most attention for creating 2D images.

Second, as the economy continues to place pressure on businesses, franchises will monetize their core users (games always monetize deeper player experiences). Lastly, games will not just be limited to a simple casual mobile experience; we will see more complex games combined with different properties, like Disney x MOBA or Kpop x Wattpad. Multiple genres of games will be commonplace. A single game with thousands of users won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be enough to be a franchise. Instead, thousands of different games will create a franchise.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">As games proliferate, game infrastructure will need a way to exchange assets seamlessly into a game. A decade ago, this was the animations and sprites made in Flash editor and dropped into games like FarmVille using ActionScript3. Whoever creates that system will be a core layer of the game infra stack and will allow developers to create more (and better?) games.</span><br/>\n<em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u00e2\u0080\u0094Andrew Lee, entrepreneur in residence, games team (</span><a href=\"https://twitter.com/ndrewlee\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">@ndrewlee</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">)</span></em></p>\n<h2><b>Games Developed on Mobile, for Mobile</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">What will the next big UGC game creation platform look like?

Roblox Studio, the PC editor application, remains too technical for most users, which explains why less than 5% of players ever become creators.

Games quickly became the canvas, the paintbrush, and the colors for young creatives.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">More than a decade after its launch, Minecraft remains one of the most lasting generational games of its time, being the first identifiable IP to reach one trillion views on YouTube. This is largely due to the boundless nature of creativity of the IP, compounded by updated worlds, physics, and assets.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In the shift of the industry to F2P and Live Ops, developers have placed less of an emphasis on custom lobbies, spectator tools, and the idea of games as theater.

Facebook and World of Warcraft both launched in 2004, and by the end of 2005, Facebook had roughly six million users and WoW had roughly five million. In each, long-term retention was caused by acts of reciprocity (pokes vs. guild gifts) and competition (vacation photos vs. armor sets). The longest-lasting games are social networks because they turn players into a more sustainable source of content than generating more levels, monsters, and quest lines.\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Today, games and social networks have become even more indistinguishable. Fortnite is built as a massively synchronous battle royale with a discrete winner, but it has become part of the zeitgeist not via balanced gunplay or map design, but because of self-expression via sharable/streamable avatars/emotes and team-based cooperation. This year, Ready Player Me inked </span><a href=\"https://blog.readyplayer.me/series-b-announcement-a16z/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">thousands of partnerships</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> with game developers to bring ultra-customizable avatars to millions of players. 2022 also saw the rise of Diablo Immortal, the first massively multiplayer online game (MMO) for millions of mobile-first gamers.

In each period, success over your rivals was determined by your ability to collect resources and produce increasingly useful technology.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Today, we are in the Space Age, and the same rules apply. Space supremacy will be the measuring stick of industrial and military power for the foreseeable future. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s already supporting our digital economies and guiding our autonomous systems. But the true Space Industrial Base is much broader. We not only need to construct advanced rockets and satellites, but gather the materials and industrial capacity to do it reliably at scale.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Space does not begin at lift-off. A complex, global supply chain \u00e2\u0080\u0094 from mining to launch pad \u00e2\u0080\u0094 must be overhauled and secured within our global alliance networks. Beyond Earth, infrastructure must be built to service existing assets in orbit and power more ambitious missions to deep space. In 2023, the Space Industrial Base will continue to grow in size, birthing critical companies serving our nation\u2019s interests. At the heart of this resurgence, inspiring founders are pursuing difficult problems in materials, manufacturing, and space infrastructure.\u00c2\u00a0</span><br/>\n<em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u00e2\u0080\u0094Ryan McEntush, partner, American Dynamism team (</span><a href=\"https://twitter.com/rmcentush\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">@rmcentush</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">)</span></em></p>\n<h2><b>Small Modular Reactors Advance the Nuclear Renaissance\u00c2\u00a0</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Though nuclear energy accounts for 20% of the US\u00e2\u0080\u0099s electricity, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s commonly misconceived as a dangerous and non-viable option when it comes to </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">adding reliable sources of carbon-free energy</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">.

With the Inflation Reduction Act earmarking $30 billion for tax credits toward existing nuclear reactors (a first for the U.S.), the timing is right to </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">usher in new innovation in this space.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">There are opportunities across the nuclear supply chain, from fuel sources to mining to manufacturing vendors and beyond. One emerging area that is particularly exciting is small modular reactors (SMRs). By leveraging advanced manufacturing techniques and modular design, SMRs can be quickly and efficiently mass-produced, bringing down costs. This can make nuclear energy more accessible for a variety of applications, including providing clean and reliable power to remote communities \u00e2\u0080\u0094 or even, one day, in space.

Verticals with jobs that are dangerous or constrained by high turnover \u00e2\u0080\u0094 waste management, for example, or industrial food preparation \u00e2\u0080\u0094 represent ideal targets for such automation.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">There are a few reasons this approach is compelling. First, a vertical focus constrains the robotics problems to be solved. Thus, many companies can rely on off-the-shelf robotic hardware and focus their development efforts on grippers and other manipulators purpose-built for their specific industry. By narrowing the environments in which these robots will be deployed, these companies can shorten time to deployment and iterate faster. Secondly, constrained use cases mean companies can focus on engineering solutions that not only replace labor, but provide a net performance improvement over humans \u00e2\u0080\u0094 a key driver for companies purchasing robotics solutions. Finally, an increasing number of robotics companies are focusing on flexibility and ease of programmability. These solutions can enable robots to be reprogrammed for a set of use cases in one industry or facility type, as opposed to performing a single, industry-agnostic task.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">This vertical focus can enable stronger moats for robotics companies.

Putting things into the hands of developers often leads to unexpected new use cases; I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m excited to see what comes next.<br/>\n<i data-stringify-type=\"italic\">\u00e2\u0080\u0094Michael Zhu, engineering partner, crypto team (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/moodlezoup\">@moodlezoup</a>)</i></p>\n<h2><b data-stringify-type=\"bold\">VDF Hardware</b></h2>\n<p>Verifiable Delay Functions (VDFs) are an exciting\u00c2\u00a0<a class=\"c-link\" data-remove-tab-index=\"true\" data-sk=\"tooltip_parent\" data-stringify-link=\"https://youtu.be/qf1CN5n8aHM\" href=\"https://youtu.be/qf1CN5n8aHM\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">cryptographic tool with many applications</a>, from verifiable lotteries to\u00c2\u00a0<a class=\"c-link\" data-remove-tab-index=\"true\" data-sk=\"tooltip_parent\" data-stringify-link=\"https://a16zcrypto.com/leader-election-from-randomness-beacons-and-other-strategies/\" href=\"https://a16zcrypto.com/leader-election-from-randomness-beacons-and-other-strategies/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">leader election</a> to preventing front-running.

If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re closing deals and you haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t been listening aggressively, you just got lucky. That success won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be repeated. Active listening sounds tired: I think of it as <em>extreme listening</em>, and here I describe how to make it part of your work. But using your two ears more and your one mouth (in that famous proper ratio) will probably help in your entire life!</p>\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-18781\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" id=\"attachment_18781\" style=\"width: 524px\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/otitis-interna.jpg?ssl=1\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-18781\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"447\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/otitis-interna.jpg?resize=524%2C447&amp;ssl=1\" width=\"524\"/></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-18781\"><em><a href=\"https://www.nsf.gov/news/special_reports/linguistics/ling_hearing.htm\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">image</a>:\u00c2\u00a0Zina Deretsky, National Science Foundation</em></figcaption></figure>\n<p>At my previous company (SuccessFactors, which was acquired by SAP), we were able to instrument extreme listening by salespeople as a company practice. This became maybe the most important flow of information for delivering the earliest and timeliest product improvements, and for bringing together a whole company of over 1000 employees with strong focus.</p>\n<h5>The whole company will listen if sales listens well</h5>\n<p>If you successfully institute a culture where each sales rep uses his or her ears \u2014 and genuinely strives to process and to learn from what they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re hearing \u2014 that data can be collected. More importantly, that data will be one of the most important data flows in the company: the difference between success or failure.</p>\n<p>If collected on a daily, monthly, and yearly basis, this data has the potential to both dramatically improve your sales team and to deeply inform the company\u2019s strategy and competitiveness. But, to do so, sales teams need <em>a path</em> to communicate that information back. In other words, to get your sales team to be better listeners, they need to be <em>heard</em> as well: by sales ops, by product management, engineering, customer success and customer support, and, of course, the CEO and other leadership.</p>\n<p>If the sales team listens systematically and strongly and has a real process by which to be heard, it will inform the company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s competitiveness and strategy more than anyone or anything else.</p>\n<h5>\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Pitch Show\u00e2\u0080\u009d</h5>\n<p>I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen Chief Revenue Officers (CROs), VPs of Sales, and the rank-and-file of area sales managers, sales reps, lead generators, and sales development reps (SDRs) alike sit in front of their #1 target customer, have 20 minutes to pitch their product \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 and then click play on their deck and spend 80% of the pitch without letting the target customer get a breath in edgewise.</p>\n<p>The deck is clearly one-size fits all, full of recycled language, delivered on auto-pilot without attention to the audience and, worst of all, entirely done <em>without asking a single question</em>. No intent or interest in listening. A strong target customer who can write a check or influence the sale to be closed will be bored and even \u00e2\u0080\u009cunsold\u00e2\u0080\u009d. These salespeople have missed the chance to stop and ask the infamous question the Mayor of New York once used to ask everyone, everywhere, that I love: \u201cHow am I doing\u2026?\u201d So it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s stunning to watch hard-working, accomplished sales reps present their pitches \u2014 which may in fact be full of entirely appropriate and well-drafted information \u2014 by droning on relentlessly until the end. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s as if getting through the deck is the goal itself, and will free them from the anxiety of getting through it.</p>\n<p>Only at the end of the pitch do they then finally ask what the customer thinks \u2014 <em>after</em> all the missed opportunities to co-develop ideas with the customer and really learn in the moment. Until then, many sales reps haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t observed, let alone deciphered, the body language of everyone in the room. Deciphering these at first seemingly odd cues and clues about what the target customer actually needs for their business makes all the difference in building a strong relationship, whether it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a potential or existing customer. Business is ephemeral and changing, and you need to adapt to the current rhythm of their business \u2014 that they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re so obviously willing to share with you, if you listen. I have been in so many business situations where the entire foundation and basis for the 6 hour flight I took to see them had completely changed by the time my plane landed. If a sales rep were to go in and just run their playbook without paying attention to these changes, they would lose.</p>\n<p>So: how to avoid that onward rush of delivery and actually engage in a pitch that picks up on the room, that re-calibrates for the most important points towards each particular audience and each potential sale? You listen and ask probing questions.<strong>\u00c2\u00a0</strong></p>\n<h5>Ask, with interest, to listen and learn</h5>\n<p>It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s reframing sales as<em> listening</em>: Starting from a place of listening to your target customer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s needs, and then carving out the space to continually listen and observe any signals throughout.</p>\n<p>How do you do \u00e2\u0080\u009cextreme listening\u00e2\u0080\u009d? Instead of saying, \u201cLook at these X data points, and these Y outputs from our product (They will make you very happy! And no one else can do it)\u201d, start by asking the audience what their goals are, the way their organization works, and what they hope to understand from you or solve for. Even if you think you already know, you really don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t: those goals and priorities have changed significantly since you agreed on the agenda. I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t remember a time when I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t learn a ton just by asking seemingly basic questions that really helped me understand the nuances of the issues the customer was facing. I remember asking such basic questions that they felt embarrassing when asked, but they changed everything and allowed us to ask much more complex questions later because we had set a tone of inquiry from the start. An example could be as basic as \u00e2\u0080\u009cwho in this room has actually signed a check before for software?\u00e2\u0080\u009d to \u00e2\u0080\u009cHow will you truly know this software will be successful?\u2026I see what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s in the request for proposal, but what resonates with you as employees here that will really make a truly difference in the business, a tangible and measurable one?\u00e2\u0080\u009d</p>\n<h5>Pursue verbal and non-verbal cues</h5>\n<p>Sales reps need to be able to read a room aggressively to pick up cues \u2014 including body language and room energy \u2014 from their audience, especially when a pitch begins to lose its touch. You need to trust any \u00e2\u0080\u009csomatic\u00e2\u0080\u009d instincts you have here. And if you feel the energy sucks, change it up. Such cues indicate moments where you could ask confirming questions like, \u201cDo you think this could be helpful to your organization?\u00e2\u0080\u009d or opening questions like \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve looked at your earnings call/your stated mission/the business challenges you are in, and we thought this product could help you like this \u2014 are we right?\u201d Or my personal favorite: \u201cIs there something here that would be a game changer for you or not? Could you use this effectively in your organization?\u201d</p>\n<p>My hope is that, apart from those questions, I get the chance to move the conversation beyond two suits exchanging professionalisms to what animates that person in their job; what makes them feel like this is one of the most important moments in their life; where they will have the chance to step up and impact the company and the customers in a meaningful way. The sort of stuff that one day ends up being the most powerful part of their interview for a promotion or new job. Ha, just reminding myself of those moments makes me laugh out loud with joy, even now because those are the moments where you get a chance to be legendary with your customer.</p>\n<p>I have never seen deals close without asking with interest, listening, and responding with sincerity. How many more deals could be closed if this were done right?!</p>\n<h5>Start a dialogue</h5>\n<p>Closed assumptions are bad for business, and they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re bad for the pitch. Yet asking more open-ended questions at the end of the presentation is more or less useless, emptying them of any real meaning or intent. The heat, the energy, the opportunity to truly connect and make magic together is gone.</p>\n<p>So, if you are attentive and listening during the pitch, you\u2019ll start a true, productive <em>dialogue</em> \u2014 one that will bring you and your customer together and help earn you the right to their business. Open questions \u2014 those questions where you clearly have not already made your mind up about the answer or your opinion on the customers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 plan \u2014 signal that you invite feedback during the presentation. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s really signaling the desire to learn as well as to put their priorities first, to work towards their goals, to make all the information you give them relevant.</p>\n<p>Finally, not only do these openings create moments to re-engage and to re-direct towards those actual priorities (stated or unstated) that your target customers have \u2014 they also provide invaluable nuggets of information. And those nuggets can help you develop (if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re early to product-market fit) or hone (if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re further along) your own overall business.</p>\n<h5>Build listening into a competitive learning culture</h5>\n<p>In fact, listening and learning during the sales pitch isn\u2019t just a route to closing deals; it\u2019s a way to find out what you can do better <em>as a company</em>.</p>\n<p>Instrumenting and operationalizing sales as a way to gather <a href=\"https://a16z.com/2015/06/01/clean-up-your-startups-b-s-bring-sales-into-the-leadership-team/\">valuable insights</a> \u2014 in addition to pitching and building long relationships \u2014 is critical to a company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s success. If it\u2019s part of your culture in every instance, I guarantee the data collected will differentiate you from the competition. This is why I always scheduled \u00e2\u0080\u009creal\u00e2\u0080\u009d calls with \u00e2\u0080\u009creal\u00e2\u0080\u009d customers in the field (I say \u00e2\u0080\u009creal\u00e2\u0080\u009d instead of the \u00e2\u0080\u009csafe\u00e2\u0080\u009d ones that were curated and cued up for me by a formal function inside the company: \u00e2\u0080\u009cCEO-proof customers\u00e2\u0080\u009d). I also always spent extra time asking, \u201cHow are we doing?\u201d The feedback I got was fun and rewarding, but often accompanied with brutal commentary; still, even then, it was followed by \u201cbut your product is the best, and you always listen to us.\u201d Building that type of relationship with customers, with this approach, makes it very hard for you to be displaced by any other competitor.</p>\n<p>My last act before signing the papers to sell our company for $3.7B and 11.6X revenue was to speak to two customers: Even at that stage, they were still kicking my ass with their feedback\u2026 and I loved it. Extreme listening, even in the last few minutes, gave me outstandingly relevant and fresh insight.</p>\n<h5>Three ways to operationalize all this listening</h5>\n<h6>Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t let the gold slip through your fingers</h6>\n<p>First and foremost, make sure you systematically request and receive information, opinions and intelligence from your sales team. This can happen in any form \u2014 email, notes, Slack, even texting from the meeting \u2014 that can be absorbed and analyzed, maybe even implemented, immediately. All a sales rep needs is the communication path for doing so. Without this, you are literally losing gigantic amounts of real, highly relevant and valuable information.</p>\n<p>I <a href=\"https://a16z.com/2015/06/01/clean-up-your-startups-b-s-bring-sales-into-the-leadership-team/\">tell a story</a> of one of my very first jobs, in-house in a 50,000 people global company; messages were left on a machine by the 3,000 sales reps calling in from the field, and when I finally listened to them, on my first day in the job, I found that no one had listened to them for years. We found new products and real business acceleration nuggets in those messages. I couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t take any credit for all the brilliant ideas produced by the field, but I was able to listen to them and put them to work for the whole organization to benefit. Though I wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t in the sales force, it made me realize the pent up power the sales force\u00e2\u0080\u0099s knowledge represented for the entire company.<strong>\u00c2\u00a0</strong></p>\n<h6>But submit real information, and be stunning in your preparation</h6>\n<p>Make sure you also train your team to get and share information that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s real \u2014 that makes sure your product is deployable <em>in a way that works for the customers</em>. That your product and this deal is likely to grab their company and move it forward in a way that it wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t before. <em>Listen</em> for what real business transformation might be, and think deeply about how you answer that problem.</p>\n<p>After meeting and working with 100,000s of employees, and 10,000s of sales reps, the sales reps that impressed me the most were the ones who understood the entire financial profile of the company, its actual public and private business issues, the latest hires and how they fit, and so on. That type of preparation makes it a lot easier to ask great product questions of the prospect. As one of my former VPs of Sales used to say: 80% of winning is the preparation before the meeting! That makes you a very welcome party, and your listening is accelerated, and the prospect will trust you because they should: you have respected them and their time by knowing what the business needs and what is going on.</p>\n<h6>Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t pretend to be Steve Jobs: What fantastic product managers do</h6>\n<p>Finally, process that information and leverage it to build a more competitive, better product <em>as you build it</em>. Too often, in new companies, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a soft underbelly of people who think they know 100% what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s right; it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the psychology of a well-educated, highly intelligent product manager who sits alone in a room deciding what the right product to build is and then decides, <em>I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m</em> gonna build that. Unfortunately, that kind of process is very nebulous to leadership and customers, not to mention it sells to customers too late.</p>\n<p>Many of those PMs tend towards the belief, even if well intentioned, that \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m like Steve Jobs; I know what they want without their having to say what they want\u00e2\u0080\u009d. But the truth is, most of us aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t Steve Jobs (to say nothing of the fact that Jobs worked 30+ years to become\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 THE Steve Jobs). Often, people hold on to this Steve Jobs myth about themselves because, on some level, they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re avoiding hearing what other people have to say. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hard to listen to others. Not to mention there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no challenge to you doing things your way with no input. Listening to the feedback that will stream back from a trusted, engaged, <em>listening </em>sales force \u2014 and incorporating that into your strategy \u2014 will not cause anything to be taken from you in terms of creativity or vision. You\u00e2\u0080\u0099re still building the project. You\u00e2\u0080\u0099re just building it better.</p>\n<p>You decide how and when you take the inputs in: That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not to say that you necessarily have to incorporate and act on all the feedback and information you get from every sales rep and every interaction. In fact, you might decide NO action is the right action. I would gladly accept a product manager coming to me and saying, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve listened to 1200 hours from the field \u2014 but I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not accepting that info. I have a different vision for this and here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s why\u00e2\u0080\u009d. When the work has been done, that calculated approach as a product manager, articulated convincingly and credibly, can actually become reinvigorating for the entire company and give confidence in the roadmap.</p>\n<p><strong>* \u00c2\u00a0 \u00c2\u00a0* \u00c2\u00a0 \u00c2\u00a0*</strong><strong>\u00c2\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>Last, but far from least, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a human upside to all this.

It turns being a cog in a coin-operated grind into being an invaluable part of the core strategy \u2014 creating a virtuous cycle of better feedback, better direction, and better focus. It also empowers the development team, the product and engineering teams, and customer support, because they get what we all crave: data and insight. They know \u2014 no longer have to guess or learn in isolation \u2014 what worked and didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t work, and the entire company can tie it all together if there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a process.

Laying your employees off is one of the hardest things you do as a leader. But remember, however badly you feel about it, your issues are small compared to those of the impacted employees. For them, the layoff may cause serious financial and psychological distress. It will also force them into a wrenching emotional disconnect from their friends and colleagues. You think you have it tough, but they have it far tougher. Your duty as a leader is to do everything in your power to give them as many resources as you can and offer them the most dignified exit possible. This will take careful thought and planning, and it may be the most important planning you ever do as CEO.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Since most people have no idea how to do layoffs well, nor have a resource to help them, this document now exists. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve unfortunately had to do layoffs, and helped others through them, so I want to share some best practices and things to think through as you do a layoff. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m starting from the point that you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve already done everything possible to avoid a layoff and you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve gone through the difficult process of figuring out what roles to eliminate. (I say </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">what roles</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, not </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">who</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, because that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s how you should be thinking about this. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not a person by person decision, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a role by role decision.)</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Also note: I am not a lawyer. I am not your HR person. And as I point out below, you absolutely must consult experienced counsel and HR professionals in this process.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Properly executing a layoff is important in a few dimensions: legally, culturally, and ethically. How you handle a layoff, how you communicate it to the people impacted, and how you manage and lead throughout the process really matters. It matters to the people who are now leaving the business, and it matters to the team that is part of the go-forward plan, and neither group will forget how people were treated.</span></p>\n<div class=\"widget widget--subscribe widget--subscribe-inline widget--subscribe-theme-default\" data-subscribe-instance=\"1\">\n<div id=\"widget-signup-form-1\">\n<h3 class=\"widget__title\"><span>Want more a16z?</span></h3>\n<p>Sign up to get our best articles, latest podcasts, and news on our investments emailed to you.</p>\n<div class=\"input-wrap\">\n<form class=\"mktoForm\" data-formid=\"1560\" data-forminstance=\"subscribe-inline-content-1\" data-thankyou-container=\"#widget-signup-form-1\" data-thankyou-message=\"#widget-signup-ty-1\" id=\"mktoForm-1560\" target=\"_blank\"></form>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"thankyou-message\" id=\"widget-signup-ty-1\" style=\"display: none\">\n<div class=\"thankyou-message-inner\">\n<h4>Thanks for signing up.</h4>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Points to consider as you </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">plan</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> your layoffs:</span></h2>\n<p><b>Consider a furlough (leave of absence)</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">: Depending on your company size, cash management requirements, and benefit plan policies, you may be able to put employees on furlough for three to six to 12 months where their salary (and potentially vesting) stops, but benefits continue. This gives the company time to stabilize finances and re-open the furloughed role, and/or allow the impacted employee ample time to find a new job while dramatically reducing the costs to the employer. If you can do this, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a huge benefit to the impacted employee. The employee is afforded the optics of still being employed while they conduct a search for a new role (which helps in their search), and they get continued benefits coverage, which is often critical. It also emphasizes the point that this is really a cost-savings decision to save the company and not a performance-related decision.\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Think about health benefits\u00c2\u00a0</span></h3>\n<p><b>Time it right</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">: If coverage in your employee health benefits plan ends on the last day of the month (most, but not all, do), and you are executing your layoff in the last \u00e2\u0085\u0093 of the month, consider designating the last day of employment for all impacted employees to be the first day of the next month. That gives every impacted employee 30 days to figure out COBRA or get added to a partner\u00e2\u0080\u0099s health plan. Leaving employees in the lurch at the end of the month or without any continuing benefits coverage is totally avoidable, so avoid it.</span></p>\n<p><b>Treat your employees like adults</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">: I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve heard many CEOs who want to offer their employees two weeks of severance but offer three months of coverage for health benefits. This well-intentioned (albeit paternalistic) thinking is wrong. In addition to creating logistical problems, you have no idea what your employees\u00e2\u0080\u0099 actual life situations are. Maybe they can get on a spouse\u00e2\u0080\u0099s benefits plan, maybe they are young enough to rejoin their parents\u00e2\u0080\u0099, maybe they will return to a home country with alternative healthcare options. Just pay them the cash and let them decide how to manage their own affairs.</span></p>\n<p><b>Think about severance</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">: Be consistent in your severance policy. Often, severance amounts will be based on tenure (much preferable to basing it on seniority). A common model employers will consider is paying two to four weeks for every year of service, with a maximum of four or eight weeks in total. Many companies won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be able to afford to part with that much cash (especially all at once), and two or four weeks may be all they can do. Offering less than two weeks severance pay is outside the norm, as is offering more than eight weeks.</span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Timing</span></h3>\n<p><b>Do it once</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">: If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve never conducted a layoff, your first instinct is to lay off as few people as possible. But anyone who has ever done layoffs as a company-saving measure will tell you they wish they had cut deeper. If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to take on the massive emotional and cultural impact of letting people go, be sure to create sufficient savings so you and the remaining team have the cash required to get through to the other side of the crisis and survive. Doing multiple rounds of layoffs demoralizes your team and erodes any trust and confidence they have in you.</span></p>\n<p><b>Are you notifying them or are they leaving that day</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">: For less experienced leaders managing through this, I recommend the date of notification be the last day the employee has access to most workplace resources including offices, laptop, email, and badge. That doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t mean they need to leave the payroll system that day (for instance, to continue benefits into the next month), but they are effectively on leave from that moment forward and no longer have to do work and can focus on finding a new job. While it can sound jarring to say \u00e2\u0080\u009cand today is your last day,\u00e2\u0080\u009d it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s generally better for people because it makes it clear that there is a new normal and it starts right now. It is reasonable to allow employees in certain roles or levels of seniority to continue to have email access for professional or business reasons. Obviously different roles come with different needs. For example, an hourly worker in a call center may not need access to anything from the point of notification forward whereas a business development executive who needs to carefully transition some key relationships to a new owner may justify continued access.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Still, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no perfect answer on this one \u2014 some employers use a longer notification period to let impacted employees begin their search for a new job while they are still technically employed, essentially trading severance time for notification period time. Figure out what is right for your company based on the kinds of roles being impacted, your culture, the maturity of your workforce, your level of comfort with having impacted employees continue to access systems, and legal requirements.</span></p>\n<p><b>Dealing with company property while remote</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">: Because of COVID-19, nearly all workers are now working from home, so you will be unable to collect their company property (laptop, badge, etc.). Be clear that this is still company property and will need to be returned at a future date \u2014 either a laptop box with a return sticker will be mailed to them or equipment can be dropped off once health-related shelter concerns are lifted. Make it clear if they are or are not allowed to use their laptop after the notification period. For many employees, this may be their only computer and would be useful in conducting their job search. Remember that with every decision you make in this process you need to err on the side of doing whatever you can to help the impacted employee. That likely means letting them still use their laptop.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Depending on your IT security policies, you may even decide to allow employees to keep their laptop as a part of their severance, but do that only after you recognize, understand, and accept the financial, security, and intellectual property risks that approach creates for your company.</span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Leverage your board, corporate counsel, and comms team</span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Ensure all layoff decisions and processes are approved by your board of directors with counsel present. Strong corporate governance isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t just a checkbox item \u2014 the feedback and legal protections you gain by getting your plan formally approved is critical for an executive. If done truly terribly, an executive could be opening themself up to various liabilities or even criminal actions.\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Corporate counsel or external employment law is an absolute. You will need to be current and up to speed on many aspects of the law around who and how you lay people off inclusive of:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Individuals on visas</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Adverse impact reporting</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Cal &amp; Federal WARN</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Releases in exchange for severance pay\u00c2\u00a0</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Throughout this planning process, confidentiality is an absolute must. However, toward the end of your planning process, be sure to include your Communications lead. They can help you draft and prepare all your internal messaging for all employees, as well as create a plan for any possible press inquiries.\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Points to consider as you </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">do</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> layoffs:</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u00c2\u00a0</span></h2>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Company communication is critical</span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">You as the CEO need to own the messaging around this. Employees joined your company because of your vision and you. And now you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve failed them. You now need to be the one to own the communication around layoffs and take responsibility for what is happening. And ultimately, it will be your decisions that determine if employees are treated with dignity and compassion. This is where trust and confidence is built or broken.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">As soon as you begin notifications, word of layoffs will travel quickly, so try to complete every conversation as quickly as you can. To the extent possible, avoid one-to-many notifications and try to notify people as privately as possible. It does not matter how many notifications you need to do, it is possible to do them all individually. If your organization is large, you will have to leverage your leadership team to take on some of the notification responsibilities. That means the burden is on you to train and educate your leaders so they do it in a way that exudes deep empathy and consideration for the impacted employees.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">As soon as notifications are complete, you will have to communicate to everyone in your company so they hear the news from you directly, and also so they know notifications are indeed complete (so they don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have to worry about their own status). Assume whatever email you send will be read by those leaving the business and potentially the general public. This should be a previously prepared email explaining the change, the reason for the change, and deep appreciation for the outgoing employees\u00e2\u0080\u0099 contributions. Remember, at this point, you are now communicating with the go-forward team. In coordination with IT or HR you will need to have a way to quickly message everyone not impacted in the workforce reduction. In the email you should also announce an all-hands for later that day (ideally) or early the following day so they know they will have an interactive opportunity to hear from you. Waiting too long to assemble the team is a grave mistake. They need to hear from you, and quickly.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Depending on the size of your organization, you may want to communicate out ahead of the layoff action to all employees. For more on this, </span><a href=\"https://a16z.com/2016/05/26/rifs/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">listen to this podcast</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> with my colleagues Shannon Schlitz, Operating Partner for our People Practices group, and Alex Rampell, General Partner and repeat founder. For smaller organizations, this is not necessary.</span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">How to </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">actually</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> tell someone they are being laid off</span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Note: This advice is geared specifically at doing layoffs remotely, but it is applicable to in-person layoffs as well.\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><b>Schedule with common sense</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">: The communication with the impacted employee should include at least two company representatives, ideally one of whom is a trained HR professional, to avoid he-said/she-said scenarios and to maximize legal protections. For more experienced managers, this isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t strictly necessary.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Be cognizant that sending a calendar invite to an employee for a 20-minute discussion with a manager and HR representative is not very subtle, so don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t do that. You can always create a second invitation for the HR person so they aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t on the original 1:1 invite. If you are doing these in an office, make sure events are configured to be \u00e2\u0080\u009cprivate\u00e2\u0080\u009d so the room calendar for the event doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t show all the meetings being scheduled in it.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t reuse your Zoom or WebEx \u00e2\u0080\u009cpersonal meeting room\u00e2\u0080\u009d in back-to-back meetings. Create a new meeting for each conversation.</span></p>\n<p><b>Be prepared</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">: It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s very smart to have a script prepared in front of you. You can piece it together from what I outline below. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not uncommon to get flustered or nervous delivering this news. Rehearse with a colleague if you need to. And trust me, you need to rehearse this. And do not stray far from your script. Do not let a thoughtful and compassionate plan be ruined with bad delivery.\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Logistically, have your camera turned on, make sure recording is turned off, and make sure you are in a quiet place without distractions. Do not be driving, etc. Have your electronic document package with all layoff and severance related information ready to go so you can send it while on the call or right after the call.</span></p>\n<p><b>Less is more</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">: Since these will be video calls, try to avoid the small talk with whomever is joining the call. You just get to the point, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI have some news to share with you. The leadership team and I have had to make some difficult decisions in order to try and save our business, and as a part of that, we are eliminating your role at the company and you are being laid off.\u00e2\u0080\u009d I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve always found you literally need to deliver the news twice (in this case, saying \u00e2\u0080\u009celiminating your role\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou are being laid off\u00e2\u0080\u009d) because many recipients quickly enter a state of shock or dismay.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">And then you just wait. The person needs a moment to process. It might be an awkward silence. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s okay. They may be upset. They may be embarrassed. They may be angry. It may be all of those things at once. But let them process. Then, they will ask you a question. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat does this mean for me?\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhen do I stop being paid?\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cHow many other people are being affected?\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat if I work harder?\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cCan I take a pay cut? I need this job.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s how to handle different kinds of questions and reactions:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">If the question is about logistics (When do I stop being paid? What does this mean?) then you can say, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI know this is a lot. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m going to be sending you a document that outlines specifically what we will be doing as a part of your exit package and providing additional information and resources for you as soon as we get off the line.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Depending on how many of these you have to do, you can talk them through it, but I would suggest not offering to walk through it as they will have a TON of questions. Make sure your paperwork is in order so you can quickly deliver them all the information, and access to all employee resources you can make available.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">If the question is on another aspect (How many people impacted? What if I work harder? Can I take a pay cut?) or is just venting, the right thing to do is listen and acknowledge them. It is not appropriate to share whom else was impacted on the team. Stick to the script, repeat the talking points, and listen. This is about them and keep the conversation focused on them. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s important to remember: You aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t there to have your mind changed, you aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t creating wiggle room or giving false hope. You are there to deliver information as clearly, and compassionately, as possible. It may be tempting to say \u00e2\u0080\u009cI didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t realize how bad this was going to be, let me see what I can do,\u00e2\u0080\u009d but that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s false hope. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s terrible and weak. It is much better to deliver the news as it is, and privately work behind the scenes if you truly feel an error has been made and needs adjusting.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">If the employee becomes overly emotional and is having difficulty composing him or herself, it is okay to end the conversation and tell the employee that you recognize it is an incredibly distressing and major change for them. Be clear you will be happy to continue the conversation once they have had time to process.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">What can you do? What can you say?</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Be a leader. This is where true leadership shows up. Demonstrate empathy, be a listener, but stand behind the company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s decisions. If you are doing the notification, but you didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t make the decision, you cannot say you are \u00e2\u0080\u009cjust the messenger.\u00e2\u0080\u009d It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s extraordinarily pathetic to question the decision to lay someone off as you are laying someone off. If you truly felt that way, you should have opted out of being the person doing the notification.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">You can certainly say \u00e2\u0080\u009cI know this news is hard to hear. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s normal to have questions that come to you later that aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t top of mind right now, and I want to make sure you reach out to me or our HR team when you have them. We want to be available to you as you have questions and do whatever we can to help you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">You can say \u00e2\u0080\u009cI know this is a lot to take in, but you will get through this.\u00e2\u0080\u009d</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">If appropriate, make clear that you or someone at the company would be willing to be a reference for them when they are considering job opportunities.\u00c2\u00a0</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Make it clear what the transition is for them, literally. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAs of today, you are no longer required to come to work or do work, and your access to email and company resources will be restricted. If we miss anything, please recognize you have a responsibility to not use company resources. We will be keeping you on payroll until the 1st of the month so that your health benefits continue for the following month\u00e2\u0080\u009d (or whatever your policy is).</span>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">A note on IT logistics: Often employees will ask \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat about all the personal items I have on my system? How can I get this information back?\u00e2\u0080\u009d While they shouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have personal data on their corporate machine, the reality is almost everyone does. I always err on the side of assuming good intentions and allowing people time to get their files in order and back them up somewhere. Since these notifications are all being done over video and employees have their laptops with them, logistically you likely have less control over this anyway.</span></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Understand what Employee Assistance Programs (EAP) are available in your benefits plan and make sure you have the documents, links, and resources ready to send to an employee so they can take advantage of all resources that they may not be aware of. This is critical, even if it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the last bullet point. Your benefits plan, and the government, have many programs available. Know what they are and be organized in how you share them. You must do every possible thing to make this less terrible for the impacted employees.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><b>How do you get an F?\u00c2\u00a0</b></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Do not make this about you. Do not, at any time, tell them how hard it is for you to give them this news, or how agonizing it was to make this plan. You still have a job, they do not. This is not hard for you, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just unpleasant. Not having a job is hard. I remember once hearing a manager say \u00e2\u0080\u009cthis has been such a hard day for me\u00e2\u0080\u009d to people in an all-hands after he conducted a layoff and I will never forget the person who said it and I will never work with that person again. Do not be this person. Even thinking about this person now just makes me angry.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Do not make jokes or be lighthearted. This is not a lighthearted thing. Even if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re nervous and trying to diffuse the tension. Even if it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an awkward silence. Just be quiet and listen. Leave room for the person to process the news.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Do not tell them they will be fine. Do not tell them they will find a better job. You don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know if that is true. Do not be prescriptive about their future. Do not tell them you will help them find a job (you may offer to try and help, but you cannot guarantee that you will find one for them, and I find the no-guarantee offer to help comes out sounding very weak).</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Do not blame others. Do not blame the virus. Do not blame the market. Do not blame your board or investors. Just own it.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Do not ask them \u00e2\u0080\u009cAre you okay?\u00e2\u0080\u009d because that phrasing is about making you feel better for delivering terrible news and has nothing to do with you supporting the employee. You can definitely ask if there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s something they need.</span>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">If you are genuinely concerned for their safety and wellbeing, or believe they are a danger to themselves or others, you need to tell them that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what you are observing, and then you need to be prepared to call someone close to them (and tell them you are doing that) and/or emergency services.</span></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">You get an F if you fail to have legal or HR review those impacted prior to notification to make sure you aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t disproportionately impacting specific protected groups (race, gender, etc.). This is especially important in larger organizations where the creation of the list of who is being impacted may have been delegated further down the organization.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">You get an F if you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t lay out your day and have a prepared communications plan (built and reviewed with HR and Comms) such that throughout the day you are largely going through a pre-planned, scripted, and practiced set of motions. Without that, you will screw it up, and then you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll get an F.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no way around this: If you have to do a layoff, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to be one of the worst days of your career. But not as bad as it will be for your impacted employees. You hired someone who worked hard and due to no fault of their own is now losing their job, at a time when losing a job is terrible. However, if you conduct your layoffs with both compassion and clarity, you will ease the burden on your employees and help them begin the process of transitioning to their next role while building trust and confidence with the team that remains.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">One last thing based on some comments from draft readers (HR pros, CEOs, etc.): </span><b>What about pay cuts instead of, or as a part of, layoffs?</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> This sounds good in theory and often helps the team in the short-term feel better about sharing the pain collectively, but it has side effects. First, your financial analysis will tell you it does very little to reduce your cash burn unless your company has hundreds of people (then it is worth considering, as it may save some roles from being impacted). If you only do 10% or 20% pay cuts, it doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t materially impact the overall weighted cost of a full-time employee. Second, it risks hurting morale significantly. Within two or three pay periods, when people start to see their reduced paycheck, they will often start to look elsewhere for work (assuming they can, otherwise they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll just be annoyed). That said, for founders, executives, the broader leadership team, and people making over a certain amount of money, pay cuts can be an important symbolic gesture. In those cases, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m supportive of pay cuts \u2014 but the gesture is generally symbolic \u2014 it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not really saving meaningful amounts of money. For individual contributors, or people paid less than a certain amount, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not worth doing pay cuts and I would absolutely exclude those individuals if you plan on enacting any pay reductions.</span></p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Thank you to Shannon Schiltz for significant feedback and guidance in writing this, and an additional thank you to HR pros Megan Bazan, Anuradha Mayer, and Zoe Smith for reviewing and commenting.</span></em></p>\n", "author": "David Ulevitch"}, "91": {"podcast": "a16z Podcast: Whos Down with CPG, DTC?

Still, the two mindsets will have to merge, so we can\u00c2\u00a0move fast \u2026 but without compromising\u00c2\u00a0quality, safety, and reliability.

The conversation generally revolves around opportunity translating into a massive mountain of necessary prerequisites \u2014 proper parenting, elite childhood education, fancy college, a focus only on S.T.E.M., credentialed work experience, and on and on. These are all great areas to focus on, but what about the talented person with drive, ambition, and desire who is already way past college age and had none of these things? What about the person who had to drop out of high school to feed the family and now has the entrepreneurial skills \u2014 but not the resume? What about the amazing musician who needs to crack the industry code? What about the genius who spent the last 10 years in prison and is ready to go for his or hers?</p>\n<p>What about the hustlers?</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, new technology platforms are creating opportunity for people with talent but with none of the prerequisites to navigate the old system. Every day at Andreessen Horowitz we see new ways to be everything from a daycare entrepreneur to an operator of a hair stylist business. Beyond that, we see ways to reverse the prison of financial services created by the legacy banking and credit card industry; we see ways to get what you are owed from your employer and the healthcare system; and we see ways to avoid (seemingly) little things like traffic and parking violations that can turn people\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lives upside down when you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re living paycheck to paycheck.</p>\n<p>That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s why we are introducing a new podcast, <i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Hustlin\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Tech, </span></i>hosted by the two of us and produced as part of the a16z Podcast.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://a16z.com/tag/hustlin-tech-hustlers-guides/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright wp-image-294159 size-medium\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"300\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/HustlinTech_a16zpodcast-2019.jpg?resize=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1\" width=\"300\"/></a>The show welcomes everybody and anybody, who has the desire, the talent, and the hustle to do great things\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 and is looking for that opportunity to shine.

But just because we don\u2019t know exactly what form that tech will take (sharing homes on Airbnb or cars with Lyft and Uber for example) doesn\u2019t mean that the larger force at play (e.g., sharing) didn\u2019t have a certain predictability to it. It was almost an inherent \u2014 and inevitable \u2014 outcome of the very nature of the internet itself. And there are at least 12 such inevitable technological forces, shares author Kevin Kelly in his <a href=\"http://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/317372/the-inevitable-by-kevin-kelly/9780525428084/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">new book</a> <em>Inevitable. \u00c2\u00a0</em></p>\n<p>As we now move from an \u201cinternet of information\u201d to an \u201cinternet of experiences\u201d \u2014 with virtual and augmented reality, AI-as-a-service, and more \u2014 we need to accept the inevitable.

People want to know why it cost between 2 and 4 times as much money to create a broken website than to build the original iPhone. This is an excellent question. However, in my experience, understanding why a project went wrong tends to be far less valuable than understanding why a project went right. So, rather than explaining why paying anywhere between $300M and $600M to build the first iteration of healthcare.gov was a bad idea, I would like to focus attention on a model for software-enabled government that works. In doing so, perhaps this will be a step toward a better understanding of how technology might make the US government better and not worse.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Early in my career as a venture capitalist, we invested in a company called Skype and I went on the board. One of the many interesting aspects of Skype was that it was based in Estonia, a small country with a difficult history . Over the centuries, Estonia had been invaded and taken over many times by many countries including Denmark, Sweden, Germany, and most recently the Soviet Union. Now independent, but well aware of their history, the Estonian people were humble, pragmatic, proud of their freedom, but dubious of overly optimistic forecasts. In some ways, they had the ideal culture for technology adoption: hopeful, yet appropriately skeptical.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Supported by this culture, Estonia built the technology platform to serve its citizens that everyone wishes we had here. Estonia developed an infrastructure that enabled its government to serve its people so well that Estonians would like to see more, not fewer, government technology projects. To explain how they did it, I\u2019ve asked one of our Entrepreneurs in Residence and Estonian,\u00c2\u00a0<a href=\"http://sten.tamkivi.com/\">Sten Tamkivi</a>\u00c2\u00a0to tell the story.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u00c2\u00a0At a casual glance,\u00c2\u00a0<a href=\"http://estonia.eu/\">Estonia</a>\u00c2\u00a0might not show up on the US radar too often. It is a tiny country in North Eastern Europe, just next to Finland. It has the territory of the Netherlands, but 10x less people. 1.3 million inhabitants is comparable to Hawaii. Estonia belongs to the European Union, Eurozone and NATO. In other words, as a friend from India recently quipped: \u201cwhat is there to govern?\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">What makes this tiny country interesting as a governance benchmark is not just that the people can elect their parliament online or get their taxes back in two days. It is rather that this level of service for citizens does not start from their government building a few web sites. Instead, Estonians started by redesigning their entire information infrastructure from the ground up with openness, privacy, security and future proofing in mind.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As the first building block of e-government, you need to be able to tell your citizens apart. Sounds blatantly obvious, but sometimes referring to a person by their social security number, then by a taxpayer number and at other times by something else doesn\u2019t cut it. Estonia uses a very simple, unique ID methodology across all systems, from your paper passport to bank records to any government office or hospital. A citizen with\u00c2\u00a0<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_identification_number#Estonia\">personal ID code</a>\u00c2\u00a037501011234 is a male born in the 20th century (3), on January 1st of year \u201975, as baby #123 of that day. The number ends with a computational checksum to easily detect typos.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">For these identified citizens to transact with each other, Estonia passed the\u00c2\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.riigiteataja.ee/en/eli/530102013080/consolide\">Digital Signatures Act</a>\u00c2\u00a0back in 2000. The state standardized on national\u00c2\u00a0<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_infrastructure\">Public-key Infrastructure</a>\u00c2\u00a0(PKI), which binds citizen identities to their cryptographic keys, \u00c2\u00a0and now doesn\u2019t care if any Tiit and Toivo (to use some common Estonian names) sign any contract between them in electronic form with certificates, or plain ink on paper. A signature is a signature in front of all laws.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As a quirky side-effect, that foundational law also forced all decentralized government systems to become digital \u201cby market demand\u201d. Namely, no part of Estonian government can turn down a citizen\u2019s digitally signed request to ask for a paper copy. As citizens opt for convenience, bureaucrats see a higher inflow of digital forms and are self-motivated to invest in systems that will help them manage the process. Yet a social worker in a small village can still provide the same service with no big investment by handling the small number of digitally signed email attachments the office receives.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">For future-proofing, the law did not lock in the technical nuances of digital signatures. In fact, the implementation has already been changing over time. Initially, Estonia equipped all traditional\u00c2\u00a0<a href=\"http://id.ee/index.php?id=30500\">ID cards</a>\u00c2\u00a0issued to every citizen for identification and domestic travel inside EU with a microchip. The chip carries two certificates: for full legal signatures and for authenticating to any trusting web site or service (used widely from government services to Internet banks). As every person over 15 is required to have one, there are now over 1.2M cards active, a close to 100% penetration of population.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As mobile adoption in Estonia rapidly approached the current 144% (#3 in Europe), the digital signatures adapted too. Instead of carrying a smartcard reader with their computer, users can now get a\u00c2\u00a0<a href=\"http://mobiil.id.ee/\">Mobile ID</a>\u00c2\u00a0enabled SIM card from their telecom operator. Without installing any additional hardware or software, they can access systems and give signatures by just typing PIN codes on their mobile phone.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As of this writing, between ID cards and mobile phones, 1.3M Estonians have\u00c2\u00a0<a href=\"http://id.ee/?lang=en&amp;id=\">authenticated 230M times and given 140M legally binding signatures</a>. Besides the now daily usage for commercial contracts and bank transactions, the most high profile use case has been the\u00c2\u00a0<a href=\"http://e-estonia.com/components/i-voting\">elections</a>: since being the first country in the world to allow voting for local elections in 2005, the system has been used for both Estonian and European Parliament Elections and in 2011 counted for already 24% of all votes. (Interestingly, the citizens voted from 105 countries in total, where they just happened to be physically at the time \u2013 like my own vote submitted from California).</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">To further speed this sort of innovation, the state tendered building and securing the digital signature certificate systems to private parties, namely a consortium led by local banks and telcos. And that\u2019s not where the public-private partnerships end: the way the data interchange in the country works is that both public &amp; private players can access the same data exchange bus (dubbed\u00c2\u00a0<a href=\"http://e-estonia.com/components/x-road\">X-Road</a>), enabling truly integrated e-services.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">A prime example is the income tax declarations Estonians \u201cfill\u201d. Quote marks are appropriate, because when an average Estonian opens the form for submission once a year, it usually looks more like a review wizard: \u201cnext -&gt; next -&gt; next -&gt; submit\u201d. This is because data has been already moving throughout the year: when employers report employment taxes every month, all the data entries are already linked into a particular person\u2019s tax records too. Non-profit reported charitable donations are recorded back as deductions for the giver the same way. Tax deductions on mortgages come directly from data interchange with commercial banks. And so forth. Not only is the income tax rate in the country a flat 21%, after submitting this pre-populated form the citizens actually get any overpayment back on their bank account (digitally transferred, of course) on the second day!</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This liquid movement of data between systems relies on a fundamental principle to protect the privacy of the citizens: without any question, it is always the citizen who owns their data. People have the right to control access to their data. For example, in case of fully digital\u00c2\u00a0<a href=\"http://e-estonia.com/components/electronic-health-record\">health records</a>\u00c2\u00a0and prescriptions, people can granularly assign access rights to the general practitioners and specialized doctors of their choosing. And in scenarios where the rule of law can\u2019t allow them to block the state from seeing their information, like with the Estonian e-policemen using their real time terminals in police cars or offices, they at least get a record of who accessed their data and when. If an honest citizen finds any official checking on their stuff without valid reason, they can file an inquiry and get them fired.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Having everything online does generate security risks on not just personal, but systematic and national level. Estonia was the target of\u00c2\u00a0<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007_cyberattacks_on_Estonia\">The Cyberwar of 2007</a>\u00c2\u00a0when well coordinated botnet attacks following some political street riots targeted government, media and finance sites and effectively cut the country from the internet abroad for several hours. But as a result, Estonia has since become the home for\u00c2\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.ccdcoe.org/\">NATO Cyber Defence Center</a>and Estonian<a href=\"http://president.ee/en/index.html\">President Toomas Hendrik Ilves</a>\u00c2\u00a0has risen internationally to be one of the most vocal advocates for cybersecurity topics among the world\u2019s heads of states.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Even more interestingly, there is a flip-side to the fully digitized nature of Republic of Estonia: taken to the max, having the bureaucratic machine of a country humming in the cloud increases the cost of any potential physical assault to the state. Imagine if physical invasion of this piece of Nordic land by anyone would not stop the government operating, but booted up a backup replica of the digital state hosted in some other friendly European territory. Democratic government would be quickly re-elected, important decisions made, documents issued, business &amp; property records maintained, births and deaths registered and even taxes flowed by those citizens still with access to the internet. May sound futuristic, but this is exactly the kind of world Estonia\u2019s energetic CIO\u00c2\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.linkedin.com/pub/taavi-kotka/33/35b/263\">Taavi Kotka</a>\u00c2\u00a0can not just dream up but actually implement, on the e-foundations the country already has today.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Yes, the circumstances of the Estonian story are special by many means. The country emerged to re-independence from 50 unfortunate years of Soviet occupation in 1991, having skipped a lot of technological legacy the Western world had built up during \u201960-\u201980s, such as checkbooks and mainframe computers and jumped right into the mid-nineties bandwagon of TCP-IP enabled web apps. During this social reset, Estonians also decided to throw their former communist leaders overboard and elected new leadership \u2013 with ministers in their late twenties from whom one can expect disruptive thinking.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">But then again, all this was 20 years ago. Estonia has by many macroeconomic and political notions become more of \u201ca boring European state,\u201d stable and predictable, if just somewhat faster growing to close the gap with Old Europe from the time they were behind the Iron Curtain. 20 years, but you can still think of Estonia as a startup country, not just by life stage, but by mindset.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">And this is what United States, along with many other countries struggling to get the internet and their increasingly more mobile citizens on it, could learn from Estonia: the mindset. Willingness to question the foundations and get the key infrastructure right, and to continuously re-invent on them. States can either build healthcare insurance brokerage sites for innovation, or really look at what key components need to exist for any service to be built: signatures, transactions, legal frameworks and such.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Ultimately, the states that create pleasant environments will be where the mobile citizens will flock to live their lives. And by many means, tiny Estonia in 2014 is no worse positioned to be the destination than New England was in 1814.</p>\n<hr/>\n<h2>Further reading</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://e-estonia.com/\">http://e-estonia.com/</a></li>\n<li>Sten\u2019s speech at Stanford last year (<a href=\"http://sten.tamkivi.com/2013/05/the-future-that-should-be-here-now/\">transcript</a>\u00c2\u00a0+\u00c2\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c2gQH2aPsM\">video</a>) on this topic</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The views expressed here are those of the individual AH Capital Management, L.L.C.

Since there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s never a \u00e2\u0080\u009cfinished\u00e2\u0080\u009d product, user feedback is indispensable for both ongoing product improvements and new product launches. This has been a secretively fast growing field fueled by the product-led trend and talent growth.</p>\n<p>Broadly, there are two types of user research: 1) generative, which looks for opportunities and problems; and 2) evaluative, which tests a particular solution. While most of the focus has been on evaluative feedback, generative feedback is just as critical \u00e2\u0080\u0094 in fact, 93% of designers conduct user research before designing anything.</p>\n<p>Moreover, in smaller, often earlier stage, companies, there are rarely dedicated user researchers, so it often falls to product managers or designers, who spend a significant amount of time \u00e2\u0080\u0094 over 30% of their day-to-day on user research. Not surprisingly, user researcher, UX designer, and product manager are some of the fastest growing roles in tech, growing ~20% YoY.</p>\n<p>Despite the importance and growth of user research, 80% of product managers still feel they don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t spend enough time talking to their customers. And most companies only hire dedicated user research teams and perform formal user research late in their product lifecycle, after they reach a certain scale. What caused this current state?</p>\n<p><strong>The existing market is fragmented, tools are manual and disjointed.</strong> Most product teams use general-purpose meeting tools such as Zoom and Google Meet to conduct/record user interviews; SurveyMonkey, Qualtrics, and Typeform to run surveys; and Google Docs and Notion to capture the notes; and spreadsheets to analyze the results. Earlier purpose-built tools such as UserTesting and UserZoom tend to be point solutions, bought and used by user researchers for specific tasks in the overall workflow, such as user recruiting or UI usability tests.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/User-Research-Market-Map-Inline-Graphics-R1-08-scaled.jpg?ssl=1\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-305748\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"439\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/User-Research-Market-Map-Inline-Graphics-R1-08.jpg?resize=1024%2C439&amp;ssl=1\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/User-Research-Market-Map-Inline-Graphics-R1-08-scaled.jpg?resize=1024%2C439&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/User-Research-Market-Map-Inline-Graphics-R1-08-scaled.jpg?resize=300%2C129&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/User-Research-Market-Map-Inline-Graphics-R1-08-scaled.jpg?resize=768%2C329&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/User-Research-Market-Map-Inline-Graphics-R1-08-scaled.jpg?resize=1536%2C659&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i2.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/User-Research-Market-Map-Inline-Graphics-R1-08-scaled.jpg?resize=2048%2C878&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i2.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/User-Research-Market-Map-Inline-Graphics-R1-08-scaled.jpg?resize=125%2C54&amp;ssl=1 125w, https://i2.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/User-Research-Market-Map-Inline-Graphics-R1-08-scaled.jpg?resize=590%2C253&amp;ssl=1 590w, https://i2.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/User-Research-Market-Map-Inline-Graphics-R1-08-scaled.jpg?resize=1120%2C480&amp;ssl=1 1120w\" width=\"1024\"/></a></p>\n<p>First-generation research tools often refitted the processes and features built for physical products to digital ones. For physical products, finding the right demographic to test out a new product idea has always been tricky, so there was a lot of value to owning the audience. As a result, most vendors on the market today are heavy on things like panel recruiting (recruiting people for these studies), but light on workflow improvements.</p>\n<p><strong>Long research cycles and hard to prove ROI.</strong> The fragmented landscape of user research tools leads to long, expensive user research cycles. Research tools are disconnected from various product management, design, or work/note suites (such as Figma, Jira, Notion) so user feedback often lives in a silo. UX researchers or product managers are carrying the burden of transferring learnings and performing manual analyses \u00e2\u0080\u0094 often with spreadsheets, shared docs, or even sticky notes \u00e2\u0080\u0094 on hundreds of survey results, hours of video recording, and pages of detailed interview notes to find useful insights.</p>\n<p>It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a process that is not only cumbersome, but also prone to error and bias. It often takes weeks to define the right approach, budget, and target groups. Depending on the actual methodology \u2014 survey, focus group, or user interview \u2014 feedback collection can take anywhere from days to months. After that, synthesizing the data will take another few weeks (at least) before the insights can be shared with a broader team. As a result, user research project budgets are often five to six figures and only spent on the most critical projects for 1 \u2013 2 times a year. The frequency is far below what product teams need, while the cost is prohibitive to improve it. Yet, with all that upfront investment, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s still hard to correlate the impact of research to the actual shipped product.</p>\n<p><strong>No current system of record.</strong> Because each user research project is treated as a single-purpose event, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no central record, tacit knowledge sharing, or a standardized workflow to support a repeatable process. The raw data and insights are often scattered around several tools, accessible to only a small group of people.</p>\n<h2>The New Wave of User Research Tools</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/New-Wave-of-User-Research-Tools-Inline-Graphic.png?ssl=1\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"size-large wp-image-314750 aligncenter\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"512\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/New-Wave-of-User-Research-Tools-Inline-Graphic.png?resize=1024%2C512&amp;ssl=1\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/New-Wave-of-User-Research-Tools-Inline-Graphic.png?resize=1024%2C512&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/New-Wave-of-User-Research-Tools-Inline-Graphic.png?resize=300%2C150&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/New-Wave-of-User-Research-Tools-Inline-Graphic.png?resize=768%2C384&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/New-Wave-of-User-Research-Tools-Inline-Graphic.png?resize=1536%2C769&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/New-Wave-of-User-Research-Tools-Inline-Graphic.png?resize=2048%2C1025&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/New-Wave-of-User-Research-Tools-Inline-Graphic.png?resize=125%2C63&amp;ssl=1 125w, https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/New-Wave-of-User-Research-Tools-Inline-Graphic.png?resize=720%2C360&amp;ssl=1 720w, https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/New-Wave-of-User-Research-Tools-Inline-Graphic.png?resize=590%2C295&amp;ssl=1 590w, https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/New-Wave-of-User-Research-Tools-Inline-Graphic.png?resize=1120%2C560&amp;ssl=1 1120w\" width=\"1024\"/></a></p>\n<p>In terms of both market demand and technological maturity, the user research industry is ready for a new wave of innovation. Following our discussions with both incumbents and startups on purpose-built user research products, we categorized the players into three main buckets based on their primary user interface mode: video, survey, or panel, plus a few incumbent players who span all three. These categories, though, are just initial wedges to enter the market.

Instead of spending weeks to find users who are \u00e2\u0080\u009cmarketers working at a 5000-employee company already using feature x\u00e2\u0080\u009d in an external research platform, new tools are providing the ability to access these users and ask simple questions directly in the product, instrumented with analytics.</p>\n<p>Sprig, for instance, conducts research through micro-surveys that product managers and researchers can configure easily through a rich template repository, to target when and who to send surveys. Because the surveys are triggered by certain events (e.g., users stuck on a screen for 10 mins after onboarding), they can target the users at the right moment without having to reproduce this journey. For a product manager or designer, the hardest question to answer is often the \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy a user did x\u00e2\u0080\u009d, since \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009cHow\u00e2\u0080\u009d are often well captured by analytics products like Amplitude or Fullstory. Micro-surveys make it possible to answer the \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhy\u00e2\u0080\u009d without being intrusive to the user journey.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Integrated with existing design and analytics ecosystem</strong></p>\n<p>User research tends to be perceived as a process between users and researchers. It is true for the most part, but there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also tight correlation and dependencies among research, design, and development or even to growth and revenue. Taking research out of context often results in broken workflow and introduces friction to the research conductors. It also stops the feedback loop to the existing ecosystem if some of the insights can be funneled back into the design/product management tools, or interpreted with additional data points.</p>\n<p>For example, during the ideation and prototyping phase, designers often test their ideas with mockups or early prototypes. It used to be a cumbersome task that involved exporting the files into a slide deck and walking users through manually, or observing users click through the prototypes and asking questions simultaneously. This process is streamlined by Maze through a one-click integration with design tools, such as Figma and Sketch, which allows designers to rapidly build tests, get answers on anything from prototypes to copy, or round up user feedback in one place.</p>\n<p><strong>3.

While quantitative research can reveal what is or isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t working, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s most often qualitative research that explains why.</p>\n<p>But even though support tickets and video recordings are known to be a treasure trove of customer insights, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no effective way to combine or distill this information and present it in a coherent format. Amplitude, Mixpanel, or Fullstory capture user journeys through clean, structured data, but some of the most valuable feedback in open response survey questions, researcher notes, or audio/video files is by nature messy and disorganized.</p>\n<p>Luckily new products are doing the heavy-lifting through transcription, tagging, searching, and clustering, so the data can be used effectively without having people spend significant time on cleaning and analysis. Dovetail, for instance, automatically transcribes user interview videos uploaded to the platform. Once the video is available as text, it can be combined with other text formats, such as notes and surveys, and tagged and annotated by the researchers. The key to reporting is providing a birds eye view but also drill downs to the point-in-time with context. The original video \u2014 which captures tone and facial expressions valuable for context and understanding \u2014 is still preserved. Reporting then becomes richer and more dynamic: Instead of showing only synthesized data, researchers can toggle between aggregated user insights and individual user response.</p>\n<p><strong>4.

If the raw data can be preserved and shared effectively, the result is valuable when connected across teams. For example, a user interview about a checkout process is important for the design team to improve usability, and for the merchant team to refine the product offering.</p>\n<p>But there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not yet been a central place to consume this information, so breaking the silos of user research data to help everyone in the organization better understand their users will go a long way. Dovetail, for instance, is building a system of record for user feedback through integrations with Typeform, Zoom, Intercom, and Github. Every piece of user feedback is analyzed and stored in the research repository. Once research results are searchable and shareable, insights become self-serve and carry value beyond a single isolated department, giving user research the tools it needs to be a central part of product development and the organization.</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>We believe we are in the early days of new tooling for user research and there will be several valuable companies created in this space. As the product-led trend continues, the speed and precision to understanding customer insights will be the most important competitive advantage.

My transcription of video interviews may not be perfect and the text is sometimes edited to reflect the brevity required in a...", "crawled": true, "body": "\n<p>Marc Andreessen is able to explain himself so well that I should have less commentary to add to the quotations in this post than usual. But where is the fun in that? My primary task with this blog post has been assembling the quotations and placing them in an order which flows well, since understanding the earlier topics helps the reader understand ideas which come later in the list\u2026</p>\n<p><strong>#1 \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe key characteristic of venture capital is that returns are a power-law distribution. So, the basic math component is that there are about 4,000 startups a year that are founded in the technology industry which would like to raise venture capital and we can invest in about 20.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe see about 3,000 inbound referred opportunities per year we narrow that down to a couple hundred that are taken particularly seriously\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 There are about 200 of these startups a year that are fundable by top VCs. \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 about 15 of those will generate 95% of all the economic returns \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 even the top VCs write off half their deals.\u00e2\u0080\u009d</strong></p>\n<p>I have done several posts on the fundamental forces which create power laws in venture capital. If you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t understand the forces which create power laws in venture capital, you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t truly understand venture capital. Power laws don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t happen by accident. There are always factors feeding back on themselves when something like investing results are reflected in a power law, and venture capital is no exception.</p>\n<p>Why power laws? To understand venture capital as well as many of the phenomena impacting individuals, companies and the global economy right now, you must understand cumulative advantage and its inverse cumulative disadvantage.</p>\n<p>Robert Merton has described cumulative advantage in this way: \u00e2\u0080\u009cexceptional performance \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 attracts new resources as well as rewards that facilitate continued high performance [repeat].\u00e2\u0080\u009d Additional ways that people use to describe this phenomenon include the Matthew effect, virtuous circles, and the rich get richer.</p>\n<p>Another important factor known as Path Dependence is used to describe at least three phenomenon: increasing returns, self-reinforcement, and positive feedback. Of course, it also the case in that failure can create negative feedback loops and vicious cycles which can make the poor get poorer. As was noted above, cumulative advantage and path dependence are operating and are self-reinforcing at every scale (e.g., individuals, startups, established businesses, communities, regions, nations and the global economy).</p>\n<p><strong>#2 \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe think you can draw a 2\u00c3\u00972 matrix for venture capital. \u00e2\u0080\u00a6And on one axis you could say, consensus versus non-consensus. And on the other axis you can say, successful or failure. And of course, you make all your money on successful and non-consensus. \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s very hard to make money on successful and consensus. Because if something is already consensus then money will have already flooded in and the profit opportunity is gone. And so by definition in venture capital, if you are doing it right, you are continuously investing in things that are non-consensus at the time of investment. And let me translate \u00e2\u0080\u0098non-consensus\u00e2\u0080\u0099: in sort of practical terms, it translates to crazy. You are investing in things that look like they are just nuts.\u00e2\u0080\u009d</strong></p>\n<p><strong>\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe entire art of venture capital in our view is the big breakthrough for ideas. The nature of the big idea is that they are not that predictable.\u00e2\u0080\u009d</strong></p>\n<p><strong>\u00e2\u0080\u009cMost of the big breakthrough technologies/companies seem crazy at first: PCs, the internet, Bitcoin, Airbnb, Uber, 140 characters.. It has to be a radical product. It has to be something where, when people look at it, at first they say, \u00e2\u0080\u0098I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get it, I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t understand it. I think it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s too weird, I think it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s too unusual.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u009d</strong></p>\n<p>This set of quotations reminds me of Howard Marks, who has said: \u00e2\u0080\u009cTo achieve superior investment results, your insight into value has to be superior. Thus you must learn things others don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t, see things differently or do a better job of analyzing them \u2014 ideally all three.\u00e2\u0080\u009d</p>\n<p>The power laws in venture capital virtually guarantee that the poseur venture capitalist who follows the crowd can never make up for all their losers, since they will not get the one or two tape measure home runs required to generate returns that limited partners demand.</p>\n<p>What is perfectly advisable for the ordinary investor (\u00e2\u0080\u009cbe the market\u00e2\u0080\u009d) spells doom for the venture capitalist because venture capital returns reflect the power law noted above. It is only in the non-consensus quadrants that optionality will be mis-priced and bargains found. Buying optionality is not enough to achieve success as a venture capitalist; it must be mis-priced. Paying too much of any asset including optionality is not a solvable problem. The matrix Marc Andreessen describes above, with an example in each quadrant, looks like this:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/screen-shot-2014-06-12-at-11-53-33-am.png?ssl=1\"><img alt=\"screen-shot-2014-06-12-at-11-53-33-am\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-7911 size-full\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"210\" sizes=\"(max-width: 568px) 100vw, 568px\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/screen-shot-2014-06-12-at-11-53-33-am.png?resize=568%2C210&amp;ssl=1\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/screen-shot-2014-06-12-at-11-53-33-am.png?w=568&amp;ssl=1 568w, https://i2.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/screen-shot-2014-06-12-at-11-53-33-am.png?w=300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/screen-shot-2014-06-12-at-11-53-33-am.png?w=125&amp;ssl=1 125w\" width=\"568\"/></a></p>\n<p><strong>#3 \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou want to have as much \u00e2\u0080\u0098prepared mind\u00e2\u0080\u0099 as you possibly can. And learn as much as you can about as many things, as much as you can.

Similarly, if you think you can predict everything you will fail as a venture capitalist. Of course, not only must the idea of the investor be non-consensus it must also be right.</p>\n<p>Most things that seem nuts in fact are nuts. But every once in a while what seems nuts is one of the 15 ideas each year that 95% of financial returns in venture capital.</p>\n<p><strong>#4 \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou want to tilt into the really radical ideas\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 but by their nature you can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t predict what they will be.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere will be certain points of time when everything collides together and reaches critical mass around a new concept or a new thing that ends up being hugely relevant to a high percentage of people or businesses. But it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s really really hard to predict those. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t believe anyone can.\u00e2\u0080\u009d</strong></p>\n<p>This set of quotes describes the best way to deal with complex adaptive systems \u2014 rather than trying to predict the unpredictable, it is best to purchase a portfolio composed of mis-priced optionality.</p>\n<p>Warren Buffett describes a portfolio of bets with optionality in this way in his 1993 Chairman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s letter: \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou may consciously purchase a risky investment \u2014 one that indeed has a significant possibility of causing loss or injury \u2014 if you believe that your gain, weighted for probabilities, considerably exceeds your loss, comparably weighted, and if you can commit to a number of similar, but unrelated opportunities.\u00e2\u0080\u009d</p>\n<p>Marc Andreessen describes his firm\u00e2\u0080\u0099s approach as being similar to Benchmark Capital and Arthur Rock (i.e., focus on big breakthrough ideas), which is unlike other venture firms that have a process where they try to create value-chain maps of where markets/the industry is going.</p>\n<p><strong>#5 Venture capitalists \u00e2\u0080\u009cspend a lot of time talking about markets and technology\u00e2\u0080\u00a6. and we have lots of opinions. \u00e2\u0080\u00a6but the decision should be around people\u00e2\u0080\u00a6. about 90% of the decision [is people].\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe are looking for a magic combination of courage and genius .\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Courage [\u00e2\u0080\u009cnot giving up in the face of adversity\u00e2\u0080\u009d] is the one people can learn.\u00e2\u0080\u009d</strong></p>\n<p>When you have a team of strong people in a startup, their ability to adapt and innovate gives the company and the investors optionality. Weak teams which can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t adapt to changing environments usually fail.</p>\n<p>Identifying the right people is all about pattern recognition.</p>\n<p><strong>#6 \u00e2\u0080\u009cAn awful lot of successful technology companies ended up being in a slightly different market than they started out in. Microsoft started with programming tools, but came out with an operating system. Oracle started doing contracts for the CIA. AOL started out as an online video gaming network.\u00e2\u0080\u009d</strong></p>\n<p>Because the future is not predictable with certainty, companies with optionality in the form of strong teams and research &amp; development capability can pivot into other markets. This can present a problems if you are a venture capitalist which has decided to only invest in one company per category.</p>\n<p>There is so much pivoting going on in consumer that some venture capitalists have stopped doing Series A rounds in that category.</p>\n<p><strong>#7 \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe great saving grace of venture capital is that our money is locked up. The big advantage that we have as a venture capital firm over a hedge fund or a mutual fund is we have a lock up on our money.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cSo we invest in these companies with a ten-year outlook.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd so enterprise can go in and out of fashion four different times, and we can go and invest in one of these companies, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s okay, because we can stay the course.\u00e2\u0080\u009d</strong></p>\n<p>Another investor who has figured the value of locked up capital from investors is Warren Buffett, who famously closed his partnership and started Berkshire. Unlike a hedge fund, Warren Buffett\u00e2\u0080\u0099s capital is locked up protecting him from people trying to redeem after the panic during a market dip.\u00c2\u00a0Bruce Berkowitz: \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat is the secret sauce: permanent capital. That is essential. I think that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the reason Warren Buffett gave up his partnership. You need it, because when push comes to shove, people run.\u00e2\u0080\u009d</p>\n<p>The ability of a venture capital firm to have cash in the bank (or at least the ability to call on cash contractually promised by limited partners) allows it to invest through the downturns, which as <a href=\"http://25iq.com/2014/06/07/a-dozen-things-ive-learned-from-michael-moritz-about-venture-capital/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">my post on Michael Moritz</a> explained, can be a very good time to start a company. Andreessen Horowitz itself is proof of that principle. Marc Andreessen has said:<em> \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe spring of 2009\u00e2\u0080\u00a6. was not a time when investors wanted to hear about a new venture capital fund. In fact, many of the large investors in venture capital and private equity were in a liquidity crisis in their own businesses, including the big university endowments where they were having real trouble meeting their commitments back to their sponsoring organizations\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 people have told us it was the harshest, most hostile time to raise new capital funding in 40 years. Of course, we are contrarian or perverse, depending on how you look at it, and we said, Well, then it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s probably going to be a very good time to raise venture capital funding.\u00e2\u0080\u009d</em></p>\n<p><strong>#8 \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe thing all the venture firms have in common is they did not invest in most of the great successful technology companies.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe mistakes that we make in a field like venture capital generally aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t investing in something that turns out not to work. \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the big hit that you missed. And so every venture capitalist who had the opportunity to invest in Google and didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t just feels like an idiot. Every venture capitalist who had the opportunity to invest in Facebook and didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t feels like an idiot. The challenge in the field is all of the great VCs over the last 50 years, the thing that they all have in common, is they all failed to invest in most of the big winners. And so this again is part of the humility in the profession.\u00e2\u0080\u009d</strong></p>\n<p>Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger call this type of mistake an \u00e2\u0080\u009cerror of omission\u00e2\u0080\u009d (i.e., what you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t do can hurt you more than what you actually do).</p>\n<p>No one describes this category of mistake better than Charlie Munger: \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe most extreme mistakes in Berkshire\u00e2\u0080\u0099s history have been mistakes of omission. We saw it, but didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t act on it. They\u00e2\u0080\u0099re huge mistakes \u2014 we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve lost billions. And we keep doing it. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re getting better at it. We never get over it. There are two types of mistakes: 1) doing nothing, what Warren calls \u00e2\u0080\u009csucking my thumb\u00e2\u0080\u009d and 2) buying with an eyedropper things we should be buying a lot of.\u00e2\u0080\u009d</p>\n<p><strong>#9 \u00e2\u0080\u009cWith tech \u2014 and you see this with a lot of these new entrepreneurs \u2014 they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re 25, 30, 35 years old, and they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re working to the limit of their physical capability. And from the outside, these companies look like they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re huge successes. On the inside, when you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re running one of these things, it always feels like you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re on the verge of failure; it always feels like it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s so close to slipping away. And people are quitting and competitors are attacking and the press is writing all these nasty articles about you, and you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re kind of on the ragged edge all the time\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u009c \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe life of any startup can be divided into two parts \u2014 before product/market fit (BPMF) and after product/market fit. When you are BPMF, focus obsessively on getting to product/market fit. Do whatever is required to get to product/market fit. Including changing out people, rewriting your product, moving into a different market, telling customers no when you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to, telling customers yes when you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to, raising that fourth round of highly dilutive venture capital \u2014 whatever is required.\u00e2\u0080\u009d</strong></p>\n<p>Starting a business isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t easy or for the faint of heart. At the same time there is not business that is easy. Almost every company is less attractive when viewed from the inside than it appears from the outside.\u00c2\u00a0My friend Craig McCaw said to me more than once that a ship as viewed from the dock may look pretty with the captain smiling from the upper deck in a resplendent uniform \u2014 but under the decks there is inevitably some ugliness associated with the travails of actually running something.</p>\n<p>The goal isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t to be perfect but rather to be a great success.</p>\n<p>Working for a startup is something that some people might want to put on a personal bucket list. The reality is that is an amazing life experience, but it is not for everyone. Lots of people talk a good game about wanting to leave a company like Apple for a startup, but when the time comes most don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t actually do it.</p>\n<p>As an aside, Marc Andreessen does not buy into the conventional notion among many in Silicon Valley that failure is good. Some failures may be inevitable when you venture out as an entrepreneur or when you take a job in a startup and you may learn from that failure, but in his view the failure itself isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t good.</p>\n<p><strong>#10 \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a new generation of entrepreneurs in the Valley who have arrived since 2000, after the dotcom bust.

Acquiring customers cost effectively is the essence of business. Almost always the best way to acquire customers cost effectively is with an organic customer acquisition strategy. In contrast, formulating a strategy based on buying advertising is unlikely to be successful.

Because it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the companies that are struggling or failing that actually need the most help. The companies that are succeeding are generally doing just fine without you. The companies that are failing are really the ones that need help and support. And so a lot of what you end up doing at the job is supporting struggling entrepreneurs. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s kind of continuously humbling. You are a trouble shooter. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s always something going wrong.

And if you are okay with that\u00e2\u0080\u0093because it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s part of the package \u2014 then the overall deal is pretty good.\u00e2\u0080\u009d</strong></p>\n<p>Bill Gurley likes to say that venture capital \u00e2\u0080\u009cis a service business\u00e2\u0080\u009d.

So you ask, Why be in the business of making something that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s almost free? What is the scarce resource? What is it that limits being able to get value out of that infinite computing power?

There is no longer a requirement that a software company manufacture the hardware systems needed to implement that system. Smartphones are increasingly ubiquitous. Computers and storage can be bought on demand as needed. The power of software to enable change drives Marc\u00e2\u0080\u0099s infectious optimism:</p>\n<blockquote><p><em>\u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is sort of where I disagree so much with people who are worried about innovation slowing down, which is that I think the opposite is happening. I think innovation is accelerating. Because the minute you can take something that was not software and make it software, you can change it much faster in the future. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s much easier to change software than it is to change something with a big, physical, real-world footprint.\u00e2\u0080\u009d </em></p></blockquote>\n<p>Importantly, when this innovation-driven change happens people\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lives get better. That this improvement in people\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lives is not captured in statistics like GDP, because it is consumer surplus or hard to measure, is a problem with economics \u2014 not technology or business.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><em>Posted here by permission of the author (who blogs at <a href=\"https://25iq.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">25iq.com</a>).\u00c2\u00a0</em><em>About the author:\u00c2\u00a0</em><em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/trengriffin\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Tren Griffin</a>\u00e2\u0080\u0099s professional background has primarily involved areas where business meets technologies like software and mobile communications.

Network effects have been similarly <a href=\"https://a16z.com/tag/all-about-network-effects/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">promoted</a> as a defensible force in building software businesses. So of course, we constantly hear about the combination of the two: \u00e2\u0080\u009cdata network effects\u00e2\u0080\u009d (heck, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve talked <a href=\"https://a16z.com/tag/data-network-effects/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">about them</a> at length ourselves).</p>\n<p>But for enterprise startups \u2014 which is where we focus \u2014 we now wonder if there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s practical evidence of data network effects at all. Moreover, we suspect that even the more straightforward data <em>scale</em> effect has limited value as a defensive strategy for many companies. This isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t just an academic question: It has important implications for where founders invest their time and resources. If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re a startup that assumes the data you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re collecting equals a durable moat, then you might underinvest in the other areas that actually <em>do</em> increase the defensibility of your business long term (verticalization, go-to-market dominance, post-sales account control, the winning brand, etc).</p>\n<blockquote class=\"pullquote pullquote--orange\">\n<h5><em><strong>Treating data as a magical moat can misdirect founders from focusing on what\u2019s really needed to win</strong></em></h5>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In other words, treating data as a magical moat can misdirect founders from focusing on what is really needed to win. So, do data network effects exist? How might a scale effect behave differently from the traditional network effect? And once we get past the hype of having to have them\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 how can startups establish more <em>durable</em> data moats \u2014 or at least figure out where data best plays into their strategy?</p>\n<h2><strong>Data + network effects \u00e2\u0089\u00a0 data network effects</strong></h2>\n<p>Broadly defined, a \u00e2\u0080\u009cnetwork\u00e2\u0080\u009d is at play when a system of users/customers/endpoints/etc. are structurally arranged in a network. In our context, such networks are often built around a technology, product, or service supporting the network structure, whether constructed around engagement features (e.g., social networks) and/or protocols (e.g., Ethernet, email, cryptocurrencies).</p>\n<p>Network <em>effects</em> <a href=\"https://a16z.com/2016/03/07/all-about-network-effects/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">occur when</a> the value of participating in a network goes up for the participants as more nodes come on to the network, or as engagement increases between existing nodes. Imagine trying to have a one-way phone conversation or call only five people in the world and no one else; the telephone system became more valuable as more users joined the network. Other common, more modern examples of network effects may include social networks, online marketplaces, and cryptonetworks.</p>\n<p>Systems with network effects generally have the property of <em>direct</em> interactions between the nodes over a defined interface or protocol. Joining the network requires conforming to some standard, which increases direct interaction for all nodes and makes those interactions increasingly stickier. But when it comes to the popular narrative around <em>data</em> network effects, we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t often see the same sticky, direct interaction play out (let alone mechanical interdependencies between nodes due to protocols or interfaces).</p>\n<p>There generally isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t an inherent network effect that comes from merely having more data.</p>\n<div class=\"download-cta\"><div class=\"inner\"><h2>The Cold Start Problem</h2><p>Andrew Chen's forthcoming book examines the impact of network effects on some of the world's largest companies.</p><a class=\"btn btn-orange\" href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Cold-Start-Problem-Andrew-Chen/dp/0062969749\">Pre-Order the Book</a></div></div>\n<h2>Most data network effects are really scale effects</h2>\n<p>Most discussions around data defensibility actually boil down to scale effects, a dynamic that fits a looser definition of network effects in which there is no direct interaction between nodes. For instance, the Netflix recommendation engine can predict that you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re likely to enjoy show <em>Y</em> if most of the viewers of your favorite film <em>X</em> also tend to watch show <em>Y</em>, even though those users don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t directly interact with each other. More data means better recommendations, which means more customers, and even more data\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 the famous \u00e2\u0080\u009cflywheel\u00e2\u0080\u009d.</p>\n<p>Yet even with scale effects, our observation is that data is rarely a strong enough moat. Unlike traditional economies of scale, where the economics of fixed, upfront investment can get increasingly favorable with scale over time, the exact <em>opposite</em> dynamic often plays out with data scale effects: The cost of adding unique data to your corpus may actually go up, while the value of incremental data goes down!</p>\n<p>Take the case of a company using a chat bot to respond to customer support inquiries. As you can see from the graph below, creating an initial corpus from customer support transcripts is likely to provide answers to simple inquiries (\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhere is my package?\u00e2\u0080\u009d). But the vast majority of inquiries are far messier, many of which are only ever asked once (\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhere is that thing that I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been waiting to arrive on my front door step?\u00e2\u0080\u009d). So in this limiting case, collecting useful inquiries becomes more difficult over time. And, after 40% of the queries have been collected in this case, there is actually no advantage to collecting more data at all!</p>\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-288314\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" id=\"attachment_288314\" style=\"width: 800px\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/datacorpusasymptote.png?ssl=1\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-288314\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"498\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/datacorpusasymptote.png?resize=800%2C498&amp;ssl=1\" width=\"800\"/></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-288314\"><em>The above graph came from a study (shared with permission) by Arun Chaganty of <a href=\"https://www.eloquent.ai/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Eloquent Labs</a>, for questions submitted to a chat bot in the customer support space.

But regardless of exactly when this happens, the ultimate outcome is often the same: the ability to stay ahead of the pack tends to slow down, not speed up, with data scale. Instead of getting stronger, the defensible moat erodes as the data corpus grows and the competition races to catch up.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"pullquote pullquote--orange\">\n<h5><em><strong>Instead of getting stronger, the data moat erodes as the corpus grows</strong></em></h5>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The point of this is not to make a categorical statement about the utility of data as a defensive moat \u2014 our point is that <em>defensibility is not inherent to data itself</em>. And unless you understand the lifecycle of the data journey for your target domain, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not guaranteed defensibility; the following framework may help.</p>\n<h2><strong>A practical framework for understanding the data journey</strong></h2>\n<h3><strong style=\"font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;\">Minimum Viable Corpus</strong></h3>\n<p>When most people talk about network effects, they focus on overcoming the bootstrapping or cold-start problem (colloquially called the \u00e2\u0080\u009c<a href=\"http://cdixon.org/2009/08/25/six-strategies-for-overcoming-chicken-and-egg-problems/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">chicken-egg</a>\u00e2\u0080\u009d problem) of acquiring enough early nodes to make the network useful for all nodes (and make the economics of the business competitive). The bootstrapping problem is hard to solve in most network effects businesses, particularly when you need the network already up and running to attract volume.</p>\n<p>But this isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t necessarily true for many enterprise businesses with a data scale effect. Bootstrapping what we think of as the \u00e2\u0080\u009cminimum viable corpus<em>\u00e2\u0080\u009d</em> is sufficient to start training against, and is the first inflection point along a startup\u00e2\u0080\u0099s data journey. This initial corpus can come from a variety of sources: automating data capture from available sources, such as crawling the web; getting early users to trade their data for something in return; repurposing data from other domains through transfer learning; and even synthetically generating data, where you programmatically create data to train against.</p>\n<p>Early in the data journey, getting to the minimum viable corpus requires relatively low investment and will clearly not be a durable moat.</p>\n<h3><strong style=\"font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;\">Data Acquisition Cost</strong></h3>\n<p>In a given corpus, getting the next piece of data tends to become <em>more</em> expensive to capture over time. Unique data that brings new signal to your corpus may be harder to find in the noise, is more of a hassle to secure, and takes longer to cleanly label over time. This is true in many domains that rely on so-called \u00e2\u0080\u009cdata network effects\u00e2\u0080\u009d.</p>\n<p>With traditional network effects, on the other hand, <a href=\"https://a16z.com/2018/08/08/growth-user-acquisition/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">user acquisition costs</a> go down over time, because the value of joining the network increases. Further, with traditional network effects there also tends to be an accompanying, more inherent virality where nodes are incented to grow the network themselves and therefore propagate to add more value to the network. Neither of these properties apply to data effects: costs of data go up.</p>\n<h3><strong>Incremental Data Value</strong></h3>\n<p>As you gather data, the data also tends to become <em>less</em> valuable to add to the corpus. Why? Even if the new arbitrary batch of data has the same cost to collect as the last batch acquired, it yields less value given some of the new data you acquire already overlaps with your existing corpus. And this only gets worse over time: Benefits of new data go down.</p>\n<p>In most of the startups we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen, new data early on applies to the entire customer base. But beyond a certain point \u2014 such as the asymptote in the example graph above \u2014 new data collected will only apply to the small subsets that lie in the \u00e2\u0080\u009clong tail\u00e2\u0080\u009d of special use cases. As such, any data scale effect moats also become less valuable as the data set gets expanded.</p>\n<h3><strong style=\"font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;\">Data Freshness</strong></h3>\n<p>This point may seem obvious but can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be emphasized enough: In many real-world use cases, data goes stale over time\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 it is no longer relevant. Streets change, temperatures change, attitudes change, and so on.</p>\n<p>Not just that, but any proprietary insight many data startups have initially weakens over time because the value of data decreases as more people collect it: Your prediction edge erodes as competitors chase you in the same domains. And the amount of work required just to keep an existing corpus fresh over time \u2014 let alone ahead of the pack \u2014 increases with scale.</p>\n<p>Data, in this sense, is like a commodity.</p>\n<h2><strong>When IS data defensible, and what can you do to manage this?</strong></h2>\n<p>None of this is to suggest data is pointless! But it does need more thoughtful consideration than leaping from \u00e2\u0080\u009cwe have lots of data\u00e2\u0080\u009d to \u00e2\u0080\u009ctherefore we have long-term defensibility\u00e2\u0080\u009d. Because data moats clearly don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t last (or automatically happen) through data collection alone, carefully thinking about the strategies that map onto the data journey can help you compete with \u2014 and more intentionally and proactively keep up with \u2014 a data advantage. It\u2019s way better to plan for it than being blindsided when an asymptote or point of diminishing returns suddenly hits your company.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"pullquote pullquote--orange\">\n<h5><em><strong>Data effects need more thoughtful consideration than leaping from \u2018we have lots of data\u2019 to \u2018therefore we have long-term defensibility\u2019</strong></em></h5>\n</blockquote>\n<h3><strong>Bootstrap the initial corpus to compete with incumbents</strong></h3>\n<p>Bootstrapping data is not so difficult in some domains, as described earlier. Yet founders can actually use this to their advantage to go head to head with incumbents that have data, but fail to apply it properly. After bootstrapping into a minimum viable corpus, startups with a head start on building out the right dataset can use that know-how to accelerate <a href=\"https://a16z.com/2017/03/17/machine-learning-startups-data-saas/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ahead of</a> incumbent competition before those incumbents figure out how to make sense of the data.</p>\n<p>Generating synthetic data is another approach to catch up with incumbents housing large tracks of data. We know of a startup that produced synthetic data to train their systems in the enterprise automation space; as a result, a team with only a handful of engineers was able to bootstrap their minimum viable corpus. That team ultimately beat two massive incumbents relying on their existing data corpuses collected over decades at global scale, neither of which was well-suited for the problem at hand.<strong>\u00c2\u00a0</strong></p>\n<h3><strong>Know the distribution of the data</strong></h3>\n<p>Having a sharp understanding of the distribution of the data corpus will inform your data strategy, and how much defensibility you can actually create, depending on the application space.</p>\n<p>The distribution of data, and its corresponding value, varies significantly by domain. As such, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s critical to intimately understand the shape of the distribution, and to craft the right strategy to capture it. Is there a fat tail of critical data that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hard to acquire? If so, what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the plan to scale the corpus into the long tail? How important is accuracy in your domain? What error rate is acceptable \u2014 it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not the end of the world if machine learning predicts the wrong auto-complete in an email to a colleague, but inaccurate object classification in the world of autonomous vehicles can, quite literally, be a matter of life and death. Misunderstanding the data distribution might even be hard to detect if not looking closely, for instance if weights aren\u2019t properly applied over time-series data (e.g., see \u201c<a data-saferedirecturl=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://arxiv.org/pdf/1612.00796.pdf&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1557469472409000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGGtEb9_ue82YJw6PFllnB2kKgBtQ\" href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1612.00796.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">catastrophic forgetting</a>\u201c).</p>\n<p>The challenge we shared earlier \u2014 that so much of the learnings in many domains are in the long tail of exceptional use cases \u2014 can also be an advantage if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re a first mover. This is particularly true for enterprise companies that embed these learnings into the product <em>and</em> the sales process. While some investors aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t drawn to the grit of wading through complex markets because they only see the difficulties on scale and margins, we believe that earning your way into a complex market creates scar tissue that is itself defensible.</p>\n<h3><strong>Understand the extent to which data improves your product</strong></h3>\n<p>In some domains, having more data results in a dramatically better product. So much so that it will overcome the increasing overhead and diminishing value of data over time. For instance, if you have a cancer screen that is 85% accurate, it is far more likely to get used than one which is 80% accurate. That use will provide additional data, which could in turn improve accuracy.</p>\n<p>While we haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t seen many of these effects play out in practice, there are a few instances where a data advantage could create a winner-take-all style advantage in the product that is clearly the foundation for a strong moat.</p>\n<p>Of course, understanding the extent to which data contributes to a product is not always straightforward. Often choice of algorithms or other product-feature tuning has a far greater impact than having more data alone.</p>\n<h3><strong>Weigh the tradeoff between quality and quantity</strong></h3>\n<p>One of the trickiest tradeoffs in nurturing a data corpus is how to balance quality versus quantity. Why is there a tradeoff? Solving too much for scale can result in okay estimates across a broad range of use cases, but not great estimates for any one of them. Solving too little for scale can result in a corpus that is well-equipped to solve a narrow problem, but underdelivers on the entire set of use cases your customers expect.</p>\n<p>In practice, this may mean focusing more effort on labeling rich data for a narrow use case, or opening the aperture more broadly to data that is useful across far more use cases. Clearly, both depth and breadth are critical properties of any corpus, but getting the balance wrong in either direction can severely impact performance. When it comes to maintaining an edge on the competition, staying on top of the quality / quantity tradeoff for your specific domain will enable you to maximize the value of incremental data added to a data moat.</p>\n<h3><strong>Secure proprietary data sources</strong></h3>\n<p>The question we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re posing throughout this post \u2014 and that we want founders to ask themselves \u2014 is <em>where</em> does the data scale effect really exist, and how long will it last? That doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t mean that there isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t practical defensibility a company can get from proprietary data; there is clearly a long list of industries (e.g., pharma) and counterexamples that have dominated their markets for decades, particularly when they have access to proprietary data sets for industry structure reasons (e.g., Equifax, LexisNexis, Experian, etc.).</p>\n<p>Accumulating proprietary data is a defensible strategy that is strongest when the sources are scanty or are reticent to provide data to more than one vendor (such as government buyers). As the bar for security requirements and compliance standards rises to an all-time high, surviving vendor scrutiny to get access to sensitive data can itself be a moat against competitors.</p>\n<p>Even taking on all the upfront costs to assemble, clean, and standardize big pools of public datasets can create a scale effect that emerging competitors will have to recreate from the ground up. Especially in cases where specialized know-how is essential to find, understand, and clean the data in the first place. Startups that prove to be responsible data custodians can earn trust from their customers, who will then share increasingly sensitive data only with them, creating a moat.</p>\n<h2>Wither data moats\u2026</h2>\n<p>Data is fundamental to many software companies\u00e2\u0080\u0099 product strategies, and there are ways it can contribute to defensibility \u2014 but don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t rely on it as a magic wand. Most of the narrative around data network effects is really around data scale effects, and as we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve outlined in this post, those sometimes have the opposite effect if not planned correctly. But don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even assume you have a data network effect (you likely don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t), or that the data scale effect will last in perpetuity (it almost certainly won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t).</p>\n<p>Instead, we encourage startups to think more holistically about defensibility. Greater long-term defensibility is more likely to come from packaging differentiated technology; understanding the domain and reflecting that in your product as you verticalize across industries; dominating the go-to-market race; and winning the talent war to build a world-class team. These efforts will pay off in defending and winning in the markets far more than data alone.</p>\n", "author": "Martin Casado, Peter Lauten"}, "106": {"podcast": "Fintech Scales Vertical SaaS | Andreessen Horowitz", "url": "https://a16z.com/2020/08/04/fintech-scales-vertical-saas-2/", "contents": "**Source: https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2018/11/06/mindbody-inc-mb-q3-2018-earnings-conference-call-t.aspx.

Now <a href=\"https://a16z.com/2020/01/21/every-company-will-be-a-fintech-company/\">new fintech infrastructure companies</a> have made it possible for SaaS businesses to add financial services alongside their core software product.

Vertical software markets tend to have winner-take-most dynamics, where the vertical SaaS business that can best serve the needs of a specific industry often becomes the dominant vertical solution and can sell both software and financial solutions to their core customer base. Moreover, while early vertical SaaS companies \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Mindbody, Toast, Shopify \u00e2\u0080\u0093 typically started by <strong>reselling</strong> financial services (primarily payments), they are now <strong>embedding</strong> financial products beyond payments \u00e2\u0080\u0093 from loans to cards to insurance \u00e2\u0080\u0093 directly into their vertical software.</p>\n<p>In this post, we will look at why fintech is driving the next evolution of vertical SaaS, why it opens new vertical markets, and where and how different business models for fintech can be applied.</p>\n<p><strong>TABLE OF CONTENTS</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#1\">With fintech, vertical markets are larger than most realize</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#2\">Fintech changes the CAC and LTV equation</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#3\">Embedding fintech (rather than just reselling) improves margins and makes the product stickier </a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#4\">Overview of fintech models</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#5\">Fintech model: payments</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#6\">Fintech model: lending/financing</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#7\">Fintech model: cards</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#8\">Fintech model: insurance</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#9\">Fintech model: bank accounts</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"1\">With fintech, vertical markets are larger than most realize</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Why-Fintech-is-the-Next-Wave-in-Monetizing-Vertical-SaaS-R3v7_The-Evolution-of-Software-Revenue-Models-1.jpg?ssl=1\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-305683\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"768\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Why-Fintech-is-the-Next-Wave-in-Monetizing-Vertical-SaaS-R3v7_The-Evolution-of-Software-Revenue-Models-1.jpg?resize=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Why-Fintech-is-the-Next-Wave-in-Monetizing-Vertical-SaaS-R3v7_The-Evolution-of-Software-Revenue-Models-1.jpg?resize=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Why-Fintech-is-the-Next-Wave-in-Monetizing-Vertical-SaaS-R3v7_The-Evolution-of-Software-Revenue-Models-1.jpg?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Why-Fintech-is-the-Next-Wave-in-Monetizing-Vertical-SaaS-R3v7_The-Evolution-of-Software-Revenue-Models-1.jpg?resize=768%2C576&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Why-Fintech-is-the-Next-Wave-in-Monetizing-Vertical-SaaS-R3v7_The-Evolution-of-Software-Revenue-Models-1.jpg?resize=1536%2C1152&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i2.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Why-Fintech-is-the-Next-Wave-in-Monetizing-Vertical-SaaS-R3v7_The-Evolution-of-Software-Revenue-Models-1.jpg?resize=125%2C94&amp;ssl=1 125w, https://i2.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Why-Fintech-is-the-Next-Wave-in-Monetizing-Vertical-SaaS-R3v7_The-Evolution-of-Software-Revenue-Models-1.jpg?resize=440%2C330&amp;ssl=1 440w, https://i2.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Why-Fintech-is-the-Next-Wave-in-Monetizing-Vertical-SaaS-R3v7_The-Evolution-of-Software-Revenue-Models-1.jpg?resize=840%2C630&amp;ssl=1 840w, https://i2.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Why-Fintech-is-the-Next-Wave-in-Monetizing-Vertical-SaaS-R3v7_The-Evolution-of-Software-Revenue-Models-1.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w\" width=\"1024\"/></a></p>\n<p>Every 10 years or so, we evolve how software is distributed and sold. Each evolution \u00e2\u0080\u0093 from on-premise to subscription and <a href=\"https://a16z.com/2020/07/29/growthsales-the-new-era-of-enterprise-go-to-market/\">bottom-up</a> \u00e2\u0080\u0093 has unlocked new markets and grown the overall software market. Until now, these software business models expanded the overall market by growing the user base, from large enterprises to small- and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) and midmarket companies to individual users. But the fintech business model increases the overall market for software in two additional ways:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>it increases revenue per user</strong> by 2 to 5x* versus a standalone software subscription, and as a result,</li>\n<li><strong>it unlocks new verticals</strong> where previously the total addressable market (TAM) for software was too small and/or the cost of acquiring customers was too high.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Vertical markets are particularly good candidates for a SaaS+fintech business model. While customers in horizontal markets often try different software vendors, resulting in multiple winners in a market segment, customers in vertical markets prefer purpose-built software for their specific industry and use cases. Once one software solution demonstrates its value, the customer base will consolidate around that company for all its software needs. As a result, vertical SaaS businesses are able to quickly become the dominant solution in a particular industry \u00e2\u0080\u0093 for example, Veeva, a CRM for pharma, has over 50% market share \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and then layer on additional products (software and financial). Servicetitan began by offering software to home services businesses, but it has since layered on financial products such as payments and lending.</p>\n<p>Let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s assume the average vertical SMB customer spends about $1,000/month on software and services. Of that, $200 per month will typically be on traditional software (e.g., ERP, CRM, accounting, marketing), and the rest on other financial services (e.g., payments, payroll, background checks, benefits). In a traditional vertical SaaS business, the only way to capture more revenue from the customer was to upsell software. This left the $800 per month potential revenue from financial services to other vendors.</p>\n<p>But with SaaS + fintech, a vertical SaaS company can capture a customer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s traditional software spend as well as the spend on employee and financial services.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Traditional SaaS expansion \u2013 Upsell software</strong> products or add software modules</li>\n<li><strong>Fintech opportunity \u2013 Add financial services</strong>, such as payments, cards, lending, bank accounts, compliance, benefits and payroll</li>\n</ol>\n<p>In our hypothetical above, a vertical SaaS company that adds, or even embeds, financial products, can potentially 5x the revenue per customer from the $200/month software spend to the full $1000/month for software and services.</p>\n<span class=\"bctt-click-to-tweet\"><span class=\"bctt-ctt-text\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https://a16z.com/2020/08/04/fintech-scales-vertical-saas-2/&amp;text=Vertical%20markets%20are%20particularly%20good%20candidates%20for%20a%20SaaS%2Bfintech%20business%20model%20because%20customers%20prefer%20one%20piece%20of%20purpose-built%20software%20for%20their%20specific%20industry%20and%20use%20cases.&amp;via=a16z&amp;related=a16z\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Vertical markets are particularly good candidates for a SaaS+fintech business model because customers prefer one piece of purpose-built software for their specific industry and use cases. </a></span><a class=\"bctt-ctt-btn\" href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https://a16z.com/2020/08/04/fintech-scales-vertical-saas-2/&amp;text=Vertical%20markets%20are%20particularly%20good%20candidates%20for%20a%20SaaS%2Bfintech%20business%20model%20because%20customers%20prefer%20one%20piece%20of%20purpose-built%20software%20for%20their%20specific%20industry%20and%20use%20cases.&amp;via=a16z&amp;related=a16z\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Click To Tweet</a></span>\n<h2 id=\"2\">Fintech changes the CAC and LTV equation</h2>\n<p>Fintech also impacts the go-to-market channels for vertical SaaS by growing the revenue per customer and making the product stickier. Put another way: fintech holds, or even lowers, the cost of customer acquisition (CAC), while increasing the lifetime value (LTV). (<a href=\"https://a16z.com/2015/08/21/16-metrics/\">Read our primer on startup metrics and acronyms.</a>)</p>\n<p>Mindbody, for example, earned ~$250/customer per month; while it charged ~$150/month, or ~$1800/year on average for its software plan, it earned an additional ~$100/month from payments revenue.** Thus, payments meaningfully increased the lifetime value (LTV) of the customer, while the cost of customer acquisition (CAC) remained the same, if not lower, since the additional value provided to the customer could accelerate the sale.</p>\n<p>Lowering CAC while increasing LTV makes a direct, inside sales go-to-market possible where it previously wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t, meaning SaaS companies can acquire new customers that would otherwise have been too expensive. At &gt;$5,000 average revenue per customer, vertical SaaS companies can afford to hire an outbound inside sales team instead of relying on less costly channels, like word of mouth and paid acquisition.</p>\n<p>In fact, fintech\u00e2\u0080\u0099s potential to dramatically increase LTV means that vertical SaaS companies can offer their SaaS product for less (or even for free) to wedge into an initial customer base that may be otherwise reluctant to digitize, before layering on fintech products as the main monetization lever.

However, embedding results in higher margins and a stickier product overall. It creates a more seamless customer experience: a loan through a familiar interface rather than being redirected to a third-party site. With an embedded service, the software provider can draw on a proprietary set of data \u00e2\u0080\u0093 such as contractor sales to inform lending or product information for better warranties \u00e2\u0080\u0093 to underwrite risk, factoring in things like seasonality to better tailor the service to each customer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s needs and risk profile.

In many cases, it works best to launch fintech products after customers have made the SaaS offering core to their operating system, giving the SaaS business the customer usage data to decide which fintech products add the most value.</p>\n<p>While payments are the first place that embedded fintech has emerged, and they remain an under-tapped opportunity, there are a host of embedded financial services, such as lending, cards, and commercial insurance, that go beyond payments. And we are starting to see additional services, such as payroll and benefits, emerge that can also be embedded rather than resold.</p>\n<p>Perhaps, best of all, while payment processing is often the simplest option to add first, companies can layer financial products and services based on the needs of their vertical market. Shopify, for instance, began offering lending products to merchants because they had the data to assist with underwriting and knew that many of their merchants had to go through the painful process of securing a loan at a traditional bank.</p>\n<p>In this section, we cover the different models that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen emerge, how each works, where it works best, what new opportunities it opens, and enabling technology partners you can leverage.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Why-Fintech-is-the-Next-Wave-in-Monetizing-Vertical-SaaS-R3v7.jpg?ssl=1\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-304311\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"426\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Why-Fintech-is-the-Next-Wave-in-Monetizing-Vertical-SaaS-R3v7.jpg?resize=800%2C426&amp;ssl=1\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Why-Fintech-is-the-Next-Wave-in-Monetizing-Vertical-SaaS-R3v7.jpg?w=800&amp;ssl=1 800w, https://i2.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Why-Fintech-is-the-Next-Wave-in-Monetizing-Vertical-SaaS-R3v7.jpg?resize=300%2C160&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Why-Fintech-is-the-Next-Wave-in-Monetizing-Vertical-SaaS-R3v7.jpg?resize=768%2C409&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Why-Fintech-is-the-Next-Wave-in-Monetizing-Vertical-SaaS-R3v7.jpg?resize=125%2C67&amp;ssl=1 125w, https://i2.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Why-Fintech-is-the-Next-Wave-in-Monetizing-Vertical-SaaS-R3v7.jpg?resize=590%2C314&amp;ssl=1 590w\" width=\"800\"/></a></p>\n<h3 id=\"5\">Payments</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>What it is:</strong> Payment processing (e.g. enabling the business to accept credit and debit card payments from its customers)</li>\n<li><strong>Referral solution:</strong> Out of the box payments processing solution for flat fee + % of transaction; SaaS business may pass through costs to its customers with a slight mark-up</li>\n<li><strong>Embedded solution:</strong> Become a payment facilitator (e.g. perform merchant underwriting and onboarding, compliance, reporting etc. in house), usually with the help of other software vendors; SaaS business then has better payment economics by lowering overall costs.</li>\n<li><strong>Embedded works best when:</strong> there is enough scale to justify the set-up cost, usually &gt;$50M of gross merchandise value</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Many vertical software companies have waited to monetize payments until their core business was scaling. Servicetitan, for instance, didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t launch payments until <a href=\"https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/servicetitan-introduces-innovative-payment-processing-solution-300404030.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">well into tens of millions ARR</a>. And Shopify, the prototypical example, originally launched without direct payments and primarily provided software to help small shops manage online storefronts. When it realized that merchants needed to process payments and had to go through a third-party \u00e2\u0080\u0093 often a complicated and painful process, Shopify decided to leverage Stripe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s API to make it easier for merchants to manage their checkout flow.</p>\n<p>Reselling or white labeling payments from payment service providers (PSPs) is one path. However, it can be difficult to monetize through additional mark-up fees without passing additional costs on to the customer. Companies that have made this work either have sufficient transaction volume to negotiate a better rate with their PSP (e.g., Shopify) or offer a tangible reason to transact over the platform instead of over other methods (e.g. <a href=\"https://a16z.com/2020/02/24/network-driven-growth/\">Bill.com</a> v. physical checks).</p>\n<p>Other businesses, however, have embedded payments to become payment facilitators (\u00e2\u0080\u009cpayfacs\u00e2\u0080\u009d) themselves. These payfacs take a more active role in processing payments and can capture 0.75-1% on the transaction volume in exchange for taking on the risks and operations associated with collecting payments.</p>\n<p>In the same way that cloud computing services democratized the ability to launch software products, emerging infrastructure players like Finix are making it possible for SaaS companies to become payfacs. However, it still requires some scale (often ~$50-100m in gross merchandise value) before it economically makes sense to devote resources to the licenses, vetting capabilities, transaction and risk management, etc involved in becoming a payfac. Additionally, whether the SaaS business is global or U.S. only; online only or online with brick and mortar stores; or if payfac is the gateway to other financial services, such as lending, should be taken into account when deciding between reselling and embedding. becoming a payfac.</p>\n<p>The bottom line: there is still a lot of white space for payments in vertical SaaS, and the next wave of payments in SaaS will likely see more becoming payfacs rather than reselling payments from a third-party. Additionally, many of the new software providers integrating payments will have even more complex payout flows \u00e2\u0080\u0093 for instance, managing payment flows across multiple stakeholders, such as multiple contractors on a construction site or media production team.</p>\n<span class=\"bctt-click-to-tweet\"><span class=\"bctt-ctt-text\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https://a16z.com/2020/08/04/fintech-scales-vertical-saas-2/&amp;text=There%20is%20still%20a%20lot%20of%20white%20space%20for%20payments%20in%20vertical%20SaaS%2C%20and%20the%20next%20wave%20of%20payments%20in%20SaaS%20will%20likely%20see%20more%20becoming%20payfacs%20rather%20than%20reselling%20payments%20from%20a%20third-party.&amp;via=a16z&amp;related=a16z\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">There is still a lot of white space for payments in vertical SaaS, and the next wave of payments in SaaS will likely see more becoming payfacs rather than reselling payments from a third-party. </a></span><a class=\"bctt-ctt-btn\" href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https://a16z.com/2020/08/04/fintech-scales-vertical-saas-2/&amp;text=There%20is%20still%20a%20lot%20of%20white%20space%20for%20payments%20in%20vertical%20SaaS%2C%20and%20the%20next%20wave%20of%20payments%20in%20SaaS%20will%20likely%20see%20more%20becoming%20payfacs%20rather%20than%20reselling%20payments%20from%20a%20third-party.&amp;via=a16z&amp;related=a16z\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Click To Tweet</a></span>\n<h3 id=\"6\">Lending / Financing</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>What it is:</strong> Loans of various types to the SaaS company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s customers (e.g., invoice factoring, 6-36 mo term loans, etc.)</li>\n<li><strong>Referral solution:</strong> Link to another company that offers loans to your customer base (e.g. Mindbody referring customers to LendingClub for SMB loans); monetize by receiving a referral fee</li>\n<li><strong>Embedded solution:</strong> Leverage your data to better underwrite and integrate the customer experience (e.g. Toast Capital); monetize typically by receiving % of loan value (based on risk of loan and who bears risk)</li>\n<li><strong>Embedded works best when:</strong> Software company owns the transaction data needed for underwriting risk, and the category is one not well understood by a traditional bank</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The loan opportunity varies greatly by type of loan, but tends to be most effective in industries with high upfront working capital and uneven spend, such as logistics / supply chain, transportation, consumer goods, food / agriculture, construction, telecom, and advanced industrial equipment customers. Vertical SaaS companies often have rich, dynamic transaction data and can understand the dynamics of the industry and customer base better than a traditional bank can. As a result, they can offer loans to businesses that were either unable to access lines of capital or tended to receive unfavorable rates \u00e2\u0080\u0093 just as Shopify\u00e2\u0080\u0099s SMB customers were before Shopify began offering loans.</p>\n<p>Historically, the primary way to offer a loan was through referral, with the SaaS companies referring customers to a lender like Kabbage or Lending Club in exchange for a referral fee. More recently, software players have started working directly with a bank partner to embed a lending program, manually managing the integration of data to underwrite and service the loan.</p>\n<p>For example, <a href=\"https://news.crunchbase.com/news/toast-launches-toast-capital-to-help-restaurants-secure-loans/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Toast launched Toast Capital last year</a>, to provide $5,000-$250K loans for restaurants, by partnering with WebBank. The loans are underwritten using Toast\u00e2\u0080\u0099s transaction data, making the application process faster and simpler, and repayment is automatic and adjusts based on the restaurant\u2019s incoming cash flow, taking into account seasonality, something a traditional bank would not be able to do.</p>\n<p>In the future, we anticipate software providers will be able to develop lending programs more easily, as today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nascent lending-as-a-service infrastructure players mature. Whether partnering directly with a bank or building on lending-as-a-service infrastructure, monetization is typically through a profit-sharing model \u00e2\u0080\u0093 the software company is more involved in the underwriting and shares some of the risk to capture a couple percentage points more of the loan value.</p>\n<h3 id=\"7\">Cards</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>What it is:</strong> Issue cards for employees or contractors of the end customer to use</li>\n<li><strong>Referral solution:</strong> Referral fee</li>\n<li><strong>Embedded solution:</strong> Work with card issuer to white label cards; monetize via interchange fees (% of transaction)</li>\n<li><strong>Embedded works best when:</strong> Customer employees / contractors need to spend autonomously and frequently</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Companies that offer virtual and physical cards have grown rapidly in recent years, with spend management software providers, like Brex, Divvy, Airbase, Teampay, and Ramp, all competing for wallet share within the high-growth technology customer segments.</p>\n<p>Many vertical markets, however, could also benefit from virtual or physical cards. This is particularly true in industries with a large number of contractors and employees who are frequently traveling or have individual spending needs. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re likely to see a wave of card fintech in vertical SaaS for construction, for example, so subcontractors can buy materials and tools in the field, rather than needing to spend out of pocket or wait for the general contractor to provide. There is also considerable opportunity in trucking, media, health &amp; wellness as well, where there are contractors or a distributed workforce.</p>\n<p>By partnering to issue cards, a vertical SaaS company can typically capture up to 1.75% on transactions, while making it easier for a finance team to monitor expenses as they happen rather than after. The infrastructure to issue cards is evolving into a mature category, with startups like Synapse and Marqeta streamlining the process.</p>\n<h3 id=\"8\">Insurance</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>What it is:</strong> Offering insurance (e.g., property insurance, workers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 compensation)</li>\n<li><strong>Referral solution:</strong> Link to another company that offers insurance to your customer base; monetize via lead generation fee</li>\n<li><strong>Embedded solution:</strong> Leverage your data to better underwrite insurance and improve the customer experience; monetize by receiving % of premiums sold</li>\n<li><strong>Embedded works best when:</strong> Software company owns the transaction data needed for better insurance underwriting</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Vertical SaaS companies can also provide insurance to their customers. For example, a SaaS company serving restaurants could provide general liability insurance insurance to its restaurant owners and worker\u00e2\u0080\u0099s comp for their employees. While all companies are mandated to buy some forms of insurance, such as worker\u00e2\u0080\u0099s comp, industries (e.g. construction, manufacturing, healthcare, media, and hospitality) that have more complexity in assessing risk, such as workplace hazards, stricter employment or legal requirements, or expensive real assets to protect will likely most appreciate a vertical SaaS solution.</p>\n<p>Data collected by the vertical SaaS company can assist in underwriting \u00e2\u0080\u0093 for instance, using restaurant reviews and other data to better underwrite workers compensation risk, or customer data to better price warranties. In the early days, we anticipate that referral fees will continue to be the primary mode of monetization, but eventually as SaaS platforms embed insurance, they could get a percentage of insurance premium sold.</p>\n<h3 id=\"9\">Bank Accounts</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>What it is:</strong> End customers can create transactional accounts to hold money</li>\n<li><strong>Referral solution:</strong> Not common</li>\n<li><strong>Embedded solution:</strong> Leverage platform\u00e2\u0080\u0099s data to better underwrite and integrate to the customer experience; monetize through flat monthly fee and/or interest sharing</li>\n<li><strong>Embedded works best when:</strong> Customers transact (both depositing and spending) frequently enough on the software platform to merit opening an account</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Bank accounts make sense if end customers are both collecting and making frequent payments via the platform and would benefit from a place to maintain a balance for those funds, rather than making constant bank transfers. Usually payments come first, and then bank accounts help manage the inflow of payments. This works particularly well in service industries (e.g., restaurants, hospitality, health / wellness / beauty) and e-commerce.</p>\n<p>Bank accounts can be enabled through some partners (e.g. Synapse, GreenDot), with more banking-as-a-service providers emerging. Earlier this year, Shopify announced that it would <a href=\"https://news.shopify.com/shopify-announces-major-product-launches-and-updates-at-virtual-event-reunite-including-shopify-balance-and-shop-pay-installments-312084\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">launch Balance bank accounts</a>, one of the first companies to offer this product. The bank accounts allow their merchants to easily collect frequent payments and also pay for Shopify services through one account, without needing to leave Shopify\u00e2\u0080\u0099s software and waiting for bank transfer times.</p>\n<h3>Other Services</h3>\n<p>Below are a number of other services that a vertical SaaS customer is already using or offering, but that the SaaS company can provide more seamlessly. Overall, these services are far less mature than financial services, and today, vertical software companies are simply resellers who refer customers to third-party services for a fee. However, we anticipate that shifting more towards embedded services, as more infrastructure providers emerge.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Payroll / taxes</strong> \u00e2\u0080\u0093 This is compelling in industries where work or pay is irregular, such as contractor or project-based work, and payment is based on percent completed rather than a fixed salary. This includes professional services (e.g. accounting, legal, and finance) as well as creative industries (e.g.media). Additionally, industries that rely on freelancers and cross-border employees (e.g., design, engineering, customer support) often have complex tax implications that require an industry-specific solution.</li>\n<li><strong>Compliance</strong> \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Background checks are one potential option. This could be a fit for industries with frequent hiring (e.g., retail, restaurants, health / wellness / beauty, construction), or with agents that require periodic credential verification (e.g., insurance). Another opportunity in compliance includes KYC (know-your-customer) checks.</li>\n<li><strong>Benefits</strong> \u00e2\u0080\u0093 This could be most beneficial in industries, where benefits (e.g. health insurance, retirement savings plans) have typically been difficult to provide, perhaps due to contractors or time-bound work that needs limited-duration benefits that traditional providers do not offer.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>It\u2019s just the beginning\u2026</h2>\n<p>Fintech is unlocking a new era for vertical SaaS, where the majority of revenue comes from financial services. As SaaS companies add financial services, they not only increase revenue per customer (often by 2-5x), but they open opportunities in markets previously deemed too small, or not cost efficient to acquire customers, to be viable.</p>\n<p>And this is just the beginning. As more companies incorporate financial services into their SaaS offerings, we look forward to seeing more markets open, and to backing the next generation of companies that will scale to even greater heights.</p>\n<p>As investors, we are excited to combine SaaS + fintech expertise to help the next generation of vertical software businesses to realize their enormous potential.</p>\n<p>\u2014</p>\n<p><em>*<strong>How did we calculate this?</strong> Market research and conversations with vertical SaaS companies. In our conversations, most vertical SaaS companies charge between $50 and $1,000 per month for software ($200 per month is a commonly accepted price point), and most end customers in vertical markets spend $500 to $1,500 per month on software and services (which we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve averaged to $1,000 per month). Consequently, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s around a 2-5x larger market opportunity when expanding out from just the software portion alone.</em></p>\n<p>**<strong><em>Source: </em></strong><em>https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2018/11/06/mindbody-inc-mb-q3-2018-earnings-conference-call-t.aspx</em></p>\n<p>Photo by\u00c2\u00a0<a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@morningbrew?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText\">Morning Brew</a>\u00c2\u00a0on\u00c2\u00a0<a href=\"https://unsplash.com/s/photos/online-transaction?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText\">Unsplash</a></p>\n", "author": "Kristina Shen, Kimberly Tan, Seema Amble, Angela Strange"}, "107": {"podcast": "Two Powerful Mental Models: Network Effects and Critical Mass", "url": "https://a16z.com/2016/03/07/network-effects_critical-mass/", "contents": "Want more a16z?

One day that summer, my friend told me about the idea behind Friendster, which sounded promising: \u201csystem, method, and apparatus for connecting users in an online computer system\u201d (according to patent number 7,069,308).</p>\n<p>Friendster was pioneering what would become known as a social network.</p>\n<p>By the time I was evaluating this potential investment in 2002, I had become a disciple of Charlie Munger\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009clattice of mental models\u00e2\u0080\u009d <a href=\"https://25iq.com/2015/08/22/a-dozen-things-ive-learned-from-charlie-munger-about-mental-models-and-worldly-wisdom/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">approach</a> to making decisions. One of the best descriptions of <strong>mental models</strong> I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen is Nobel-prize winning social scientist Herbert Simon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s original framing of the concept, where he states that better decision makers have at their disposal repertoires of possible actions; checklists of things to think about before acting; <em>and</em> \u00e2\u0080\u009cmechanisms in mind to evoke these, and bring these to conscious attention when the situations for decision arise.\u00e2\u0080\u009d</p>\n<p>So a mental model isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t a passive framework, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s something to actively use in making decisions. In each case you must decide not only which mental models to apply, but which ones are most important. Each model is like a different filter or tool. The mental models are applied in parallel and not in a serial, step-by-step way. The process is necessarily analog in nature since in most cases assumptions are rough, the systems involved are complex adaptive systems, and different models can be self-reinforcing. The process is also based on experience: The decision maker is usually applying judgment most often acquired from when he or she made mistakes in the past.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"pullquote\"><p>a mental model isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t a passive framework, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s something to actively use in making decisions</p></blockquote>\n<p>One of the most important mental models in business is the concept of <strong>network effects</strong>. This is especially true today, when other factors that can create a moat against competitors \u2014 brand, regulation, supply-side economies of scale, and intellectual property (like patents) \u2014 are under threat. As software continues to \u00e2\u0080\u009ceat the world,\u00e2\u0080\u009d network effects become even more important as a factor in creating a moat since that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the primary way software companies build a barrier to entry against competitors. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s why venture capital firms investing in software-based startups include network effects in the business attributes they are looking for</p>\n<p>Nothing scales as well as a software business, and nothing creates a moat for that business more effectively than network effects.</p>\n<p>Network effects don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t always lead to direct financial or long-term value, however. For example, a standard like Ethernet generates network effects and benefits that last longer than one would expect for supply-side economies of scale. But Ethernet also illustrates that sometimes no one directly financially benefits from the standard itself (since it is owned by no one). And even if network effects are strong initially, as with DEC, Palm, and BlackBerry \u2014 they can be brittle and disappear relatively quickly, as those businesses discovered.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"pullquote\"><p>Nothing scales as well as a software business, and nothing creates a moat for that business more effectively than network effects</p></blockquote>\n<h5>Network effects as a mental model</h5>\n<p>Network effects exist when the \u00e2\u0080\u009cvalue\u00e2\u0080\u009d of a format or system depends on the number of users. These effects can be positive (for example, a telephone network) or negative (for example, congestion). They can also be direct (increases in usage lead to direct increases in value to users, as with the telephone) or indirect (usage increases the production of complementary goods, as with cases for mobile phones). Network effects can protect valuable markets, or not much of a market at all in terms of financial value.</p>\n<p>Network effects can exist in settings that are not obvious. Take ESPN for example. It has demand-side economies of scale (aka network effects) \u2014 most notably for SportsCenter \u2014 since the more people who watch the ESPN channels, the more valuable the channels are to each user because those particular images will be the basis of discussion for sports fanatics.\u00c2\u00a0Partly due to those network effects, ESPN has a competitive advantage compared to Fox and other sports channels that have a hard time replicating the demand-side effects. When someone says \u00e2\u0080\u009cdid you see X do Y in the Z game?\u00e2\u0080\u009d if you watched the Fox version of SportsCenter, you may not have seen the particular video clip.</p>\n<p>In tech, significant market adoption of a proprietary format or system can create a network effect and a competitive advantage for a business that is similar to supply-side economies of scale. But network effects are potentially more powerful. Unlike supply-side\u00c2\u00a0economies of scale, the benefits of demand-side economies of scale can increase in a <em>nonlinear</em> manner, especially in software businesses. This means that the benefits realized by a Google are far larger than those realized by a large steel or cement producer based on supply-side economies of scale. Google has at least two beneficial demand-side economies of scale \u2014 one for search and one for advertising targeting \u2014 that are mutually reinforcing and accordingly give it a strong moat. As Munger has observed: \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve probably never seen such a wide moat\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009cI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know how you displace Google.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00c2\u00a0Om Malik <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/tech/elements/in-silicon-valley-now-its-almost-always-winner-takes-all\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">writes</a> about this winner-take-all dynamic as well.</p>\n<p>For the owner of the platform, such as Google in this case, the networks effects form the basis of a powerful moat that bestows sustainable competitive advantage. A company may have revenue without some form of a moat,\u00c2\u00a0but it is highly unlikely it\u00c2\u00a0will be <em>sustainably</em> profitable over time without one.</p>\n<p>Some network effects are strong and some are weak.\u00c2\u00a0 For example, Google\u00e2\u0080\u0099s moat in the advertising-serving business is strong. Yahoo\u00e2\u0080\u0099s moat in the financial news market (Yahoo Finance) is very weak. Some markets impacted by multi-sided makers with network effects are big and lucrative (e.g., ESPN or Bloomberg\u00e2\u0080\u0099s terminal business) and some are not (Yahoo Sports).</p>\n<p>Some companies have both demand <em>and</em> supply-side\u00c2\u00a0economies of scale. Amazon has both, and they reinforce each other. For example, the more people who provide comments on Amazon the more valuable it becomes to other users due to demand-side economies (everybody knows to find reviews on Amazon). Amazon also has huge advantages on warehouses and the supply chain on the supply-side, which it passes along to its customers in the form of lower costs.</p>\n<p>In fact, most companies have both supply-side and demand-side economies of scale. However, these fall along a continuum of weak to strong.\u00c2\u00a0The Holy Grail for an entrepreneur is demand-side economies of scale that can cause a market to \u00e2\u0080\u009ctip\u00e2\u0080\u009d, giving almost the entire market to one company (winner-takes-all). Markets are more likely to tip if scale economies are high and the consumers have a low demand for variety. At one point, demand for online auctions tipped strongly to eBay. Over time that tipping phenomenon has weakened.</p>\n<p>But the reality is that most demand-side economies do <em>not</em> cause a market to \u00e2\u0080\u009ctip\u00e2\u0080\u009d and yield a single winner. For example, the rental car industry has a number of providers since weak demand-side economies in that business were not strong enough to make the market tip.</p>\n<h5>When applying network effects goes too far</h5>\n<p>When I was applying the mental model of network effects to the Friendster decision back in 2002, I saw potential for a big financial upside. My experience in the wireless industry led me to conclude that the more people who used Friendster, the more valuable it would become.</p>\n<p>But I had just come through the Internet bubble and seen how people had taken the concept of network effects too far \u2014 and without sufficient depth \u2014 led by \u00e2\u0080\u009cPiped Pipers\u00e2\u0080\u009d of financial doom like George Gilder, who first formulated Metcalfe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Law. An article by Briscoe, Odlyzko, and Tilly <a href=\"http://spectrum.ieee.org/computing/networks/metcalfes-law-is-wrong\">describes</a> the folly:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\u00e2\u0080\u009cBy seeming to assure that the value of a network would increase quadratically \u2014 proportionately to the square of the number of its participants \u2014 while costs would, at most, grow linearly, Metcalfe\u2019s Law gave an air of credibility to the mad rush for growth and the neglect of profitability. It may seem a mundane observation today, but it was hot stuff during the Internet bubble.\u00e2\u0080\u009d</p></blockquote>\n<p>The article goes on to propose that more realistically:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\u00e2\u0080\u009cthe value of a network of size <em>n</em> grows in proportion to <em>n</em> log(<em>n</em>). Note that these laws are growth laws, which means they cannot predict the value of a network from its size alone. But if we already know its valuation at one particular size, we can estimate its value at any future size, all other factors being equal\u00e2\u0080\u00a6. The fundamental flaw underlying\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Metcalfe\u2019s law is in the assignment of equal value to all connections or all groups.\u00e2\u0080\u009d</p></blockquote>\n<p>The point is that the strength of network effects is not just determined by the number of participants in a network. Affinity <em>between</em> participants, and the value of trade between those participants, matters. As the authors of the article referenced above observe, the increasing value \u00e2\u0080\u009clies somewhere between linear and exponential growth\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u2014 and where exactly it fits will vary from case to case, as amusingly shown by this illustration from Serge Block [<a href=\"http://thoughts-illustrated.blogspot.com/2008/07/ieee-spectrum-metcalfes-law-is-wrong.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">via</a> Thoughts Illustrated]:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"sergebloch\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-13697\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"368\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/sergebloch.jpg?resize=500%2C368&amp;ssl=1\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/sergebloch.jpg?w=500&amp;ssl=1 500w, https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/sergebloch.jpg?w=300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/sergebloch.jpg?w=125&amp;ssl=1 125w\" width=\"500\"/></p>\n<p>(As an aside, I had found Andrew Odlyzko\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ideas to be particularly useful in the past, most notably when he wrote important papers debunking claims about the rate of Internet growth. For example, it was while reading Odlyzko\u2019s paper in November of 2000 that I realized: \u201cHoly crap, Cisco\u2019s Internet growth numbers are rubbish.\u201d)</p>\n<blockquote class=\"pullquote\"><p>the strength of network effects is not just determined by the number of participants in a network</p></blockquote>\n<p>Ultimately, I decided not to invest in Friendster due to potential conflicts in some other work I was doing at the time. But my instincts about it benefitting from network effects turned out to be correct: By June 2003 the service had 835,000 registered members; four months later, there were more than two million.</p>\n<p>Yet growth would eventually stall. And Friendster would be overtaken first by MySpace and then conclusively by Facebook. Why?</p>\n<h5>Critical mass as a related mental model</h5>\n<p>There are a number of autopsies written about what went wrong with Friendster. The only thing they really share in common is that they are all guesses about the outcome of complex adaptive systems. So opinions on \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhat happened to Friendster\u00e2\u0080\u009d are like belly buttons \u2014 everyone has one, and they are all different. <em>Wired</em>\u00c2\u00a0magazine summarizes the conclusion of one opinion, citing David Garcia, a professor with the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cWhat they found was that by 2009, Friendster still had tens of millions of users, but the bonds linking the network weren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t particularly strong. Many of the users weren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t connected to a lot of other members, and the people they had befriended came with just a handful of their own connections. So they ended up being so loosely affiliated with the network, that the burden of dealing with a new user interface just wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t worth it. \u2018First the users in the outer cores start to leave, lowering the benefits of inner cores, cascading through the network towards the core users, and thus unraveling,\u2019 Garcia told us.\u201d</p></blockquote>\n<p>Garcia raises an important issue related to network effects here, though: that of <strong>critical mass</strong>, which is yet another mental model.</p>\n<p>The term \u201ccritical mass\u201d came into use around 1941 though it originally had a very limited definition: the minimum amount of a given fissionable material necessary to sustain a nuclear chain reaction at a constant rate. While not the first to use the term in a physics setting, the physicist Leo Szilard is said to be\u00c2\u00a0the first person to propose that a chain reaction could be created starting from a critical mass of uranium. And that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the critical point behind the concept as we apply it today.</p>\n<p>Soon, other disciplines began to use the term \u00e2\u0080\u009ccritical mass\u00e2\u0080\u009d as a mental model. One of the first people to apply it to the social sciences was the same person who created the mental models construct \u2014 Herbert Simon. His influential essay on critical mass, \u201cBandwagon and underdog effects and the possibility of election predictions\u201d, was published in 1954. (Simon later went on to win the Nobel Prize \u00e2\u0080\u009cfor his pioneering research into the decision-making process within economic organizations\u00e2\u0080\u009d.)</p>\n<p>Other definitions of critical mass exist for other disciplines. In business, critical mass <a href=\"http://www.investinganswers.com/financial-dictionary/economics/critical-mass-623\">refers</a> to \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe size a company needs to reach in order to efficiently and competitively participate in the market. This is also the size a company must attain in order to sustain growth and efficiency.\u00e2\u0080\u009d In a <em>technology</em> business, critical mass refers to the level of users that are required to help create a set of network effects that are so strong, that they build a moat for that particular business. Sometimes there is no second place in a market when network effects are that strong.</p>\n<p>Critical mass is present in a platform business if a sufficient number of users adopt an innovation in a system so that adoption of those innovations becomes self-reinforcing. The classic example people cite to illustrate this point was the competition between the Beta and VHS videocassette formats in the 1970s. Beta was considered to be the superior format in terms of quality but VHS reached critical mass first. A research paper by Sangin Park notes:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cThe tipping and de facto standardization of the VHS format in 1981-1988 is believed to have been caused by network externalities [aka network effects]. In the time period, watching prerecorded videotapes such as movie titles became the most important reason to use VCRs. Hence an increase in the users of VHS VCRs could raise a variety of available movie titles and thus the demands for VHS VCRs. That is, indirect network externalities became signification in the home VCR market.\u201d</p></blockquote>\n<p>Getting to critical mass when creating a multi-sided market is sometimes called overcoming the \u00e2\u0080\u009cchicken and egg problem\u00e2\u0080\u009d, which can be stated simply as: How do you get one side to be interested in a platform until that other side exists (and vice versa)? How did someone sell the first ever fax machine when there was no one on the other end to receive the fax yet? (Obviously that salesperson had to sell at least two machines.)</p>\n<p>But in the case of complements that are different \u2014 such as game developers making games for Sony consoles before there were even a lot of consoles out there \u2014 how do you get one side (developers or console buyers) on board in the first place? In Sony\u00e2\u0080\u0099s case, it sold game consoles at a loss to build up a base of users that would attract developers. As with all network effects, this eventually resulted in a flywheel effect where enough developers made enough games to attract enough users (players) which in turn attracted more developers and thus resulted in more games for more those players and a stronger user base for developers and so on.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"pullquote\"><p>How do you get one side to be interested in a platform until that other side exists?</p></blockquote>\n<p>What happens if a market does \u00e2\u0080\u009ctip\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the <em>competitor</em> that reaps those benefits? Well, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what happened to MySpace with Facebook. MySpace started to monetize before the social networking market \u00e2\u0080\u009ctipped\u00e2\u0080\u009d. Facebook held off monetizing until its moat was secure.\u00c2\u00a0Zuckerberg was patient about waiting for the market to tip whereas Rupert Murdoch was not. So MySpace paid the price and Facebook reaped the rewards.</p>\n<h5>Some mental models should be weighted more than others</h5>\n<p>The mental models approach is simpler than it seems. There are about 100 important mental models (which come from multiple disciplines) that a person should use. \u00e2\u0080\u009cFortunately,\u00e2\u0080\u009d as Munger says, \u00e2\u0080\u009cit isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t that tough because 80 or 90 important models will carry about 90% of the freight in making you a worldly wise person. And, of those, only a mere handful really carry very heavy freight.\u00e2\u0080\u009d</p>\n<p>I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d argue that network effects and critical mass are two of these mental models that carry a lot of weight.</p>\n<p>You do not need to know every mental model or even know them all deeply to make better decisions, but you do need to understand how most of them work at a basic level at least. Speaking about that importance of balancing depth vs. breadth, Charlie Munger recently said \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe trouble is you make terrible mistakes everywhere else without [extreme specialization], so synthesis should be a second attack on the world after specialization. It is defensive, and it helps one to not be blindsided by the rest of world.\u00e2\u0080\u009d</p>\n<p>In business, specialization helps acquire comparative advantage. But not being wise can bite you in the rear end.</p>\n<p>The application of a mental model from physics to other disciplines \u00e2\u0080\u0093 as well as business or life questions \u2014 is intended to be a method of improving general thought. But it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pure folly to assume that formulas from physics can be applied in human affairs and produce the same predictive outcomes. As Richard Feynman says, electrons do not have feelings like people. The real world \u2014 which is a nest of complex systems \u2014 can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be modeled like a physical system. The trick is to apply the basic ethos of physics in your metal model without assuming that the real world can be modeled with formulas containing Greek letters.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, the goal is to use mental models \u2014 like network effects and critical mass \u2014 to increase the probability of correct decisions. It is far better to be roughly right rather than to be precisely wrong in doing so.</p>\n<h1><strong>12 x 2 quotes on network effects and critical mass</strong></h1>\n<p><strong><em>Network effects</em></strong></p>\n<p>1. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhen the value of a product to one user depends on how many other users there are, economists say that this product exhibits network externalities, or network effects.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Carl Shapiro and Hal Varian</p>\n<p>2. \u00e2\u0080\u009cA network effect exists when the value of a good increases because the number of people using the good increases. All things being equal, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s better to be connected to a bigger network than to a smaller one. Adding new customers typically makes the network more valuable for all participants because it increases the probability that everyone will find something that meets their needs. So getting big fast matters, not only because it creates more value, but also because it assures that competing networks never take hold.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Michael Mauboussin</p>\n<p>3. \u00e2\u0080\u009cNetwork effects are tricky and hard to describe but fundamentally turn on the following question: Can the marketplace provide a better experience to customer \u00e2\u0080\u009cn+1000\u00e2\u0080\u009d than it did to customer \u00e2\u0080\u009cn\u00e2\u0080\u009d directly as a function of adding 1000 more participants to the market? You can pose this question to either side of the network \u00e2\u0080\u0093 demand or supply. If you have something like this in place it is magic, as you will get stronger over time not weaker.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Bill Gurley</p>\n<p>4.\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cBusinesses [can] create barriers to entry through \u201cnetwork effects\u201d, in which the value of a service to a user increases as others use it. This can potentially arise in a number of ways: for example a proprietary data asset; the marketplace dynamics of having a robust set of sellers and buyers; or through the development of a community that openly shares and exchanges information. In an era where the initial cost to develop the prototype of a product has been dramatically reduced, where there are mature and scalable open source tools and services to utilize for that development, and where cloud infrastructure is available on demand and at a variable cost, defensibility may no longer be found in the technology underpinnings \u2014 the code or IP \u2014 of a service. Defensibility may however arise through the growth of service that gets more valuable, and more interesting, with each new participant.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Union Square Ventures</p>\n<p>5. \u00e2\u0080\u009cA popular strategy for bootstrapping networks is what I like to call \u00e2\u0080\u0098come for the tool, stay for the network.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 The idea is to initially attract users with a single-player tool and then, over time, get them to participate in a network. The tool helps get to initial critical mass. The network creates the long term value for users, and defensibility for the company.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Chris Dixon</p>\n<p>6. \u00e2\u0080\u009cNetwork effects can be powerful, but you\u2019ll never reap them unless your product is valuable to its very first users when the network is necessarily small\u2026.Paradoxically, then, network effects businesses must start with especially small markets. Facebook started with just Harvard students\u2013Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s first product was designed to get all his classmates signed up, not to attract all people of Earth. This is why successful network businesses rarely get started by MBA-types: the initial markets are so small that they often don\u2019t even appear to be business opportunities at all.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00c2\u00a0Peter Thiel</p>\n<p>7. \u00e2\u0080\u009c\u00e2\u0080\u00a6there are what I call groove-in effects tied to customers and consumers. Basically, this means that the more I use a product, the more I\u2019m familiar with that product, the more convenient it gets for me. I use Microsoft Word. There might be a better program out there, but I know all the tricks with Word that I mastered over several years and I am very reluctant to give that up to start over with another product.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Brian Arthur</p>\n<p>8. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe answer [to creating a flywheel] lies in two essential variables: the size of the market and the strength of the value proposition. Any growth goes through an exponential curve, then flatters with saturation. If the ceiling of the market opportunity is $200 million, even if you get a flywheel, it will take you from twenty to sixty or seventy, then peter out because you saturated the available space. The bigger the market the more runway you have \u2014 so if you hit that knee of the curve, you can grow exponentially and keep going for a long time. Doubling a business of material size for three to four years leads to a really large, important company. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a key element in the flywheel idea.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Roelof Botha</p>\n<p>9.\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cIn marketplace businesses, sell-through rate can also go by \u00e2\u0080\u009cclose rate\u00e2\u0080\u009d, \u00e2\u0080\u009cconversion rate\u00e2\u0080\u009d, and \u00e2\u0080\u009csuccess rate\u00e2\u0080\u009d. Regardless of what it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s called, sell-through rate is one of the single most important metrics in a marketplace business. As investors, we like to see a relatively high rate so that suppliers are seeing good returns on the effort they put into posting listings on the marketplace. We also like to see this ratio improving over time, particularly in the early stages of marketplace development (as it often indicates developing network effects).\u00e2\u0080\u009d Andreessen Horowitz, 16 Metrics</p>\n<p>10. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBecause the long-run success of a song depends so sensitively on the decisions of a few early-arriving individuals, whose choices are subsequently amplified and eventually locked in by the cumulative-advantage process, and because the particular individuals who play this important role are chosen randomly and may make different decisions from one moment to the next, the resulting unpredictably is inherent to the nature of the market. It cannot be eliminated either by accumulating more information \u2014 about people or songs \u2014 or by developing fancier prediction algorithms, any more than you can repeatedly roll sixes no matter how carefully you try to throw the die.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Duncan Watts</p>\n<p>11. \u00e2\u0080\u009cUltimately, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re all social beings, and without one another to rely on, life would be not only intolerable but meaningless. Yet our mutual dependence has unexpected consequences, one of which is that if people do not make decisions independently \u2014 if even in part they like things because other people like them \u2014 then predicting hits is not only difficult but actually impossible, no matter how much you know about individual tastes. The reason is that when people tend to like what other people like, differences in popularity are subject to what is called \u00e2\u0080\u009ccumulative advantage,\u00e2\u0080\u009d or the \u00e2\u0080\u009crich get richer\u00e2\u0080\u009d effect. This means that if one object happens to be slightly more popular than another at just the right point, it will tend to become more popular still. As a result, even tiny, random fluctuations can blow up, generating potentially enormous long-run differences among even indistinguishable competitors \u2014 a phenomenon that is similar in some ways to the famous \u00e2\u0080\u009cbutterfly effect\u00e2\u0080\u009d from chaos theory.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Duncan Watts</p>\n<p>12. \u00e2\u0080\u009cNetwork effects can be classified along a spectrum, with stronger and weaker forms.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Michael Mauboussin</p>\n<p><strong><em>Critical mass</em></strong></p>\n<p>1. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe notion of a critical mass \u2014 that comes out of physics \u2014 is a very powerful model.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cAdding success factors so that a bigger combination drives success, often in non-linear fashion, as one is reminded by the concept of breakpoint and the concept of critical mass in physics.

And of course I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been searching for lollapalooza results all my life, so I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m very interested in models that explain their occurrence. An extreme of good performance over many factors.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Charlie Munger</p>\n<p>2. \u201cWe don\u2019t have automatic competitive advantages. We\u2019re seeing some more insurance volume, mainly from General Re, and Cort and Precision Steel have momentum, but we have to find future advantages through our own intellect. We don\u2019t have enough critical mass and momentum in place at Wesco, so investors are betting on management.\u201d Charlie Munger. He is saying that he does not like a situation where he does not have critical mass in the business or businesses he controls and that sometimes we must rely on having better management. He would prefer to have business that even an idiot can run successfully but sometimes that is not the case.</p>\n<p>3. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere will be certain points of time when everything collides together and reaches critical mass around a new concept or a new thing that ends up being hugely relevant to a high percentage of people or businesses. But it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s really really hard to predict those. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t believe anyone can.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Marc Andreessen</p>\n<p>4. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOne clear lesson in the history of technology and business is that once an open standard gains critical mass, it is extremely hard to derail. The x86 computing architecture and the Ethernet networking standard are two salient examples of this truism. Once a single inter-operable standard gains the acceptance of multiple vendors in a marketplace, a consumer bias toward compatibility and scale economics create an increasing returns phenomenon that is nearly unassailable.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Bill Gurley</p>\n<p>5. \u00e2\u0080\u009cEconomies of scope and agglomeration are obtained by the presence of a critical mass of consumers\u00e2\u0080\u00a6. Using a chemistry analogy, we hypothesize that (see Stuart Kaufman and Brian Arthur), a critical mass of consumers and producers, a \u00e2\u0080\u0098soup\u00e2\u0080\u0099 with sufficient diversity of consumers, producers, ideas, skills, at a sufficient scale and critical mass will become autocatalytic. Economic activity, newly catalyzed business activity, and other surprise will emerge. Emergent behavior, surprising and unplanned, is a well-known behavior of complex systems and a manifestation of the invisible hand of Adam Smith.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Vinod Khosla</p>\n<p>6. A tipping point is \u201cthe moment of critical mass, the threshold, the boiling point.\u201d Malcolm Gladwell</p>\n<p>7. \u00e2\u0080\u009cPhase transitions are unusual points in the \u00e2\u0080\u0098phase space\u00e2\u0080\u0099 of possible states, while most of this space is occupied by stable states.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere seem to be \u00e2\u0080\u0098laws\u00e2\u0080\u0099 [of] social systems that have at least something of the character of natural physical laws, in that they do not yield easily to planned and arbitrary interventions. Over the past several decades, social, economic and political scientists have begun a dialogue with physical and biological scientists to try to discover whether there is truly a \u00e2\u0080\u0098physics of society\u00e2\u0080\u0099, and if so, what its laws and principles are. In particular, they have begun to regard complex modes of human activity as collections of many interacting \u00e2\u0080\u0098agents\u00e2\u0080\u0099 \u2014 somewhat analogous to a fluid of interacting atoms or molecules, but within which there is scope for decision-making, learning and adaptation.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Philip Ball</p>\n<p>8. \u201cAt a certain scale, a system reaches a critical mass or a limit where the behavior of the system may change dramatically. It may work better, worse, cease to work or change properties. Small interactions over time slowly accumulate into a critical state \u2014 where the degree of instability increases. A small event may then trigger a dramatic change like an earthquake. A small change may have no effect on a system until a critical threshold is reached. For example, a drug may be ineffective up until a certain threshold and then become effective, or it may become more and more effective, but then become harmful. Another example is from chemistry. When a system of chemicals reaches a certain level of interaction, the system undergoes a dramatic change. A small change in a factor may have an unnoticeable effect but a further change may cause a system to reach a critical threshold making the system work better or worse. A system may also reach a threshold when its properties suddenly change from one type of order to another. For example, when a ferromagnet is heated to a critical temperature it loses its magnetization. As it is cooled back below that temperature, magnetism returns.\u201d\u00c2\u00a0Peter Bevelin</p>\n<p>9. \u201cSilicon Valley has evolved a critical mass of engineers and venture capitalists and all the support structure \u2014 the law firms, the real estate, all that \u2014 that are all actually geared toward being accepting of startups.\u201d Elon Musk</p>\n<p>10. \u00e2\u0080\u009cStartups with a customer base need to maintain an ongoing dialog with their customers \u2014 not make a set of announcements when the founder thinks it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s time for something new. This is why entrepreneurship is an art. When you have a critical mass of customers, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a fine line between sticking with the status quo too long and changing too abruptly.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Steve Blank</p>\n<p>11. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf you tell Facebook about your startup before you reach critical mass, you are an idiot.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Jason Calacanis</p>\n<p>12. \u00e2\u0080\u009cCritical Mass.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Dr. Evil</p>\n<p><img alt=\"drevilmeme\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-13705\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"569\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"(max-width: 704px) 100vw, 704px\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/drevilmeme.png?resize=704%2C569&amp;ssl=1\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/drevilmeme.png?w=704&amp;ssl=1 704w, https://i2.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/drevilmeme.png?w=300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/drevilmeme.png?w=125&amp;ssl=1 125w\" width=\"704\"/></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<hr/>\n<p><em>This post was syndicated\u00c2\u00a0by permission of the author.\u00c2\u00a0</em><em>About the author:\u00c2\u00a0</em><em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/trengriffin\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Tren Griffin</a>\u00e2\u0080\u0099s professional background has primarily involved areas where business meets technologies like software and mobile communications.

We know the now-canonical early examples of this: Amazon, eBay, Craigslist. And we also know that once that holy grail of a new digital platform is attained, competitors quickly come a\u00e2\u0080\u0099 callin\u00e2\u0080\u0099.\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">One of the most effective forms of that competition often comes in the form of newcos who aspire to take chunks out of that emergent platform by better addressing the needs of a </span><a href=\"https://a16z.com/2020/02/18/marketplace-glossary/\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">specific vertical</span></i></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> within that platform\u00e2\u0080\u0094by creating a user experience or business model that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s much more tailored to the unique attributes of that vertical. StubHub, for example, took a big chunk out of eBay by creating a ticket-buying experience that was so in tune with the needs of those specific buyers and sellers\u00e2\u0080\u0094with ticket verification, venue maps, and rapid shipping\u00e2\u0080\u0094that they were able to get strong traction in spite of the fact that their fees were substantially higher than what eBay was charging (which likely motivated eBay to buy Stubhub in 2007).\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The classic example of this </span><a href=\"https://acrowdedspace.com/post/166470695392/the-rebundling-of-craigslist\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">dynamic in action</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> is well captured in this graphic of the unbundling of Craigslist:\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-294304\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" id=\"attachment_294304\" style=\"width: 422px\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/unbundling-craigslist.png?ssl=1\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-294304\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/unbundling-craigslist.png?resize=422%2C281&amp;ssl=1\" width=\"422\"/></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-294304\"><em>image credit: Andrew Parker</em></figcaption></figure>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen this dynamic play out several times now (and Craigslist, Amazon and eBay still remain prime targets, given their large GMVs and attractive <a href=\"https://a16z.com/2020/02/18/marketplace-glossary/\">vertical markets</a>). In fact, this strategy can sometimes be so powerful that some of these new businesses are not only bigger than the original </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">vertical</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> they disrupted, but bigger than the platform </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">as a whole</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. In other words, they serve the needs of users in their vertical so much better that they can compete for a much larger share of their vertical against both analog and digital players.</span></p>\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-294308\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" id=\"attachment_294308\" style=\"width: 441px\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Platforms-VS-Verticals-BlogGraphic-Darcy.jpg?ssl=1\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-294308\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"323\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Platforms-VS-Verticals-BlogGraphic-Darcy.jpg?resize=441%2C323&amp;ssl=1\" width=\"441\"/></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-294308\"><em>*a16z has not independently verified revenue figures herein</em></figcaption></figure>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The moral of the story is this: In all but a few circumstances, the broad horizontal verticals eventually break. They become a victim of their own success. As the platforms grow, their submarkets grow too; their product gets pulled in a million different directions. Users get annoyed with an experience and business that caters to the lowest common denominator. And suddenly, what was previously too small a market to care about is a very interesting place for a standalone newco. Like clockwork, a new wave of innovation begins to swell, picking off the compelling verticals the new horizontal players cannot satisfy.\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">If you know which platforms are teetering on this precipice, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll know where to look for both opportunity and innovation.\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<blockquote class=\"pullquote pullquote--orange\">\n<h3><strong>\u201cIf you know which platforms are teetering on this precipice, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll know where to look for both opportunity and innovation.\u201d\u00c2\u00a0</strong></h3>\n</blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">YouTube, for example\u00e2\u0080\u0094a monster platform in video, with approximately 1.3 billion active users who currently generate </span><a href=\"https://biographon.com/youtube-stats/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">$4 billion in annual revenue</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u00e2\u0080\u0094is currently experiencing this. A large number of newcos are trying to get a piece of that action, by targeting specific categories and audiences within the larger general platform. Twitch has seen a lot of success in gaming videos (Amazon acquired the company for just under $1 billion in 2014); TikTok has exploded in short-form mobile videos; MasterClass by targeting educational videos; </span><a href=\"https://a16z.com/2018/02/14/overtime/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Overtime</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> by zeroing in on sports, with highlights and original content aimed at Gen Z; and many startups are looking now to claim the space of video content for kids (which YouTube is undesigned for\u00e2\u0080\u0094so much so that it was </span><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/04/technology/google-youtube-fine-ftc.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">recently fined</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">).\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Zillow is also being targeted for unbundling. The leading digital real estate platform in the U.S., Zillow aspires to serve needs across many sub-verticals in real estate, from buying/selling a home, to leasing or renting a home/apartment, to sourcing home loans, to finding an agent. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s current market cap is $7 billion. But those are a lot of different marks, with different business models and different users\u00e2\u0080\u0094and Zillow has only just scratched the surface of the category\u00e2\u0080\u0099s migration from analog to digital. As a result, there are multiple newco digital competitors targeting chunks of the market. For example, Compass, OpenDoor, and FlyHomes are targeting the buying/selling a home vertical, but in unique ways that are difficult for Zillow to imitate.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">One of the most attractive \u00e2\u0080\u009cplatform\u00e2\u0080\u009d targets we see today, only just starting to be chipped away at, is LinkedIn. Take a look at LinkedIn\u00e2\u0080\u0099s revenue from 2009-2016. At the time of LinkedIn\u00e2\u0080\u0099s June 2016 sale to Microsoft for $26.2 billion, their </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">quarterly revenue</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> of the time of sale was ~$1B.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/LinkedIn-revenue.png?ssl=1\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-294305 aligncenter\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"368\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/LinkedIn-revenue.png?resize=505%2C368&amp;ssl=1\" width=\"505\"/></a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Like all these other horizontal players, LinkedIn offers essentially the same user experience across job verticals. For jobs like white collar roles, the site works well. But for other, more specialized verticals\u00e2\u0080\u0094blue collar jobs, engineers, or health care workers, for example\u00e2\u0080\u0094their needs are met much less well. Add to that the perception that the company might not continue to be as innovative or risk-taking as a subsidiary of one of the biggest companies in the world, and you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got very ripe opportunities for disruption by innovators with tailored vertical approaches.\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">We are already beginning to see innovation bubbling up with newcos using this vertical play in the jobs platform space. From engineering (Hired) to blue collar (Merlin, Wonolo) to oil services (RigUp) to hospitality (Pared, Instawork, Qwick) to bookkeeping (Paro), each of these new companies are building a user experience and business model that works better\u00e2\u0080\u0094for both candidates and employers\u00e2\u0080\u0094than the generic LinkedIn model. In other words, the great unbundling of LinkedIn may have already begun.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Savvy founders know that finding the right market at the right time can be like a cheat code for startup success. Looking at verticals within the broad horizontal platforms that are near their breaking point is like a cheat code for a cheat code: if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re paying attention, it will point you to the next great unbundling and where the next wave of opportunity and innovation will come from.</span></p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The views expressed here are those of the individual AH Capital Management, L.L.C.

You can watch a <a href=\"https://youtu.be/nj2kcN7e6p0\">video version on YouTube</a>.</em></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">With so much technology in our everyday lives, it\u2019s easy to wonder: Are we at the end of innovation for consumer tech? I believe we\u2019re still at the beginning\u00e2\u0080\u0094there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a lot more change to come. In particular, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m really excited about four trends:</span></p>\n<p><strong>Everything will become a super app</strong><br/>\nCompanies will work together to offer customers more unique products and services, discovering new revenue streams in the process.</p>\n<p><strong>Everything will become commerce</strong><br/>\nIn the near future, we will be all shopping from our entertainment apps, including video, social media apps, and messaging.</p>\n<p><strong>Increasingly, tech will go physical</strong><br/>\nOur digital identities will be linked with our physical ones.</p>\n<p><strong>Earshare is the new mindshare</strong><br/>\nCompanies will take advantage of the massive explosion in audio consumption and podcasts.</p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Everything will become a super app</strong></span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">According to <a href=\"https://www.emarketer.com/content/average-us-time-spent-with-mobile-in-2019-has-increased\">eMarketer</a>, in 2019 we spent more time on our cell phones than watching television: 3 hours and 43 minutes, on average, compared to 3 hours and 35 minutes.\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/tv-v-mobile.png?ssl=1\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-297861\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"514\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/tv-v-mobile.png?resize=1024%2C514&amp;ssl=1\" width=\"1024\"/></a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The problem is that the average person is spending nearly than three hours of that time on apps. Only the small remainder\u00e2\u0080\u009426 minutes\u00e2\u0080\u0094is being spent in the mobile browser. So, the long tail of the internet is not migrating over to the phone.\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The other problem is that people are not downloading as many apps. In fact, the average person will download <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2016/9/16/12933780/average-app-downloads-per-month-comscore\"><em>zero</em></a> apps every month. What does that mean for all of us? How do we fix the problem? The answer is super apps.\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">This is the home tab of Meituan, a popular food delivery service in China. In 2013, Meituan started thinking about what other revenue streams it could create\u00e2\u0080\u0094they added a button on top where you could start booking hotel nights. Today, Meituan is responsible for booking nearly <a href=\"https://kr-asia.com/meituan-an-unexpected-entrant-to-chinas-ota-industry-that-topples-ctrip\">50 percent</a> of hotel stays in China. The previous big player, Ctrip, is down to <a href=\"https://kr-asia.com/meituan-an-unexpected-entrant-to-chinas-ota-industry-that-topples-ctrip\">22 percent</a>.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/super-apps1.png?ssl=1\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-297857\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"569\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/super-apps1.png?resize=1024%2C569&amp;ssl=1\" width=\"1024\"/></a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">You can also find attractions, nightlife, movie tickets, bike-sharing and much more on Meituan. The company took a high-frequency, low-margin business\u00e2\u0080\u0094food delivery\u00e2\u0080\u0094and tacked on more low-frequency, high-margin businesses at low (or zero) customer acquisition costs. Meituan is leveraging its distribution and understanding of its customers, thinking </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">what other revenue streams can I create with that mindshare</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Meituan is just one of many examples. In China, they also have WeChat and Alipay. In Southeast Asia, there\u2019s Gojek, which is used not only for transportation and food delivery, but also to book massage appointments, find moving services, and more. You can even use it to top up your mobile payment plan. And in the US, Uber is transforming itself from a transportation company into the operating system for our everyday lives. You see, super apps are here to stay, and the big internet giants in the States already get it. This trend is coming from East to West.\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/super-apps2.png?ssl=1\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-297858\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"575\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/super-apps2.png?resize=1024%2C575&amp;ssl=1\" width=\"1024\"/></a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">If you are lucky enough to be one of those high-frequency-use apps, what are new revenue streams that you can introduce to your customer? And if you\u2019re not, what are other big, existing apps that you can partner with? What do you uniquely know about your customer that can add extra value to one of those big players?\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s one example of how you can discover your hidden data asset. Spotify, a music streaming service, knows a lot about my musical interests. They know which artists and podcasts I like. What else can this data be used for? Spotify could use that data to help artists and concert promoters figure out which cities they should be touring in. They should use data to inform their strategy. (\u00e2\u0080\u009cShould I spend one more night in New York or book that day at STAPLES Center?\u201d) In fact, Spotify should be able to work with artists and tell them how to personalize their playlist for every single city. These are new revenue streams that Spotify can unlock by discovering their hidden data assets.\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/hidden-data-asset.png?ssl=1\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-297854\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"571\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/hidden-data-asset.png?resize=1024%2C571&amp;ssl=1\" width=\"1024\"/></a></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Who thought a music streaming app could have such a huge impact on concerts and live promotions? Similarly, who thought a short video app could empower all kinds of commerce?</span></p>\n<h2><strong>Everything will become commerce</strong></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The second big trend is that everything is going to become transaction-related. We spend a lot of time in apps: video apps, communication apps, social media apps, and more. These apps are actually perfect distribution vehicles for commercials that we actually </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">want</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> to watch. Let me show you what that means, via live streaming apps and short video apps in China. On the left, you\u2019ll see a farmer take you to his orange orchard and slice the fruit in front of your eyes. I think it\u2019s the best commercial for fruit that I\u2019ve ever seen.\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/authenticity-in-context.png?ssl=1\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-297847\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"571\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/authenticity-in-context.png?resize=1024%2C571&amp;ssl=1\" width=\"1024\"/></a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Imagine yourself lying in bed at midnight, scrolling through a feed of videos, and seeing something like this. Your mouth starts watering. You would love to buy a box of those oranges. Well, the platform lets you do that. With a few taps of the screen, the user can get a box of those delicious oranges shipped right to their door. If you\u2019re wondering how short video apps are going to monetize in the States, this is a one model. This is already happening in other countries.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">On the right, here\u2019s another example. This fisherman is catching a lobster that you can order online. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">When you click through the video, you can even find recipes on how to cook the seafood. In the US, we have a vague concept about what the phrase \u00e2\u0080\u009cfarm to table\u00e2\u0080\u009d means. This is what farm to table really looks like; this is authenticity in context.\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<h2><strong>Tech goes physical</strong></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The third big trend I wanted to talk about is how technology is going to show up more and more in our physical world.\u00c2\u00a0</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In China, you already see more than 200 airports <a href=\"http://www.timeoutshanghai.com/features/Blog-Travel/70176/Passengers-can-now-use-facial-recognition-to-check-in-at-200-Chinese-airports.html\">testing</a> these kiosks. With facial recognition, they tell you exactly what gate to go to, and how to get there.\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/facial-recognition.png?ssl=1\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-297852\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"576\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/facial-recognition.png?resize=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1\" width=\"1024\"/></a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Classrooms are also\u00c2\u00a0 leveraging facial technology to take attendance. You can no longer get away with asking your classmates to sign in for you.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Now, some of these may seem a little spooky. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s enough to make you wonder: Will facial recognition ever be a big thing in the US? It\u2019s already happening. Delta Airlines is actually testing facial recognition in some international airports for check-in and boarding. And <a href=\"https://news.delta.com/delta-expands-optional-facial-recognition-boarding-new-airports-more-customers\">72 percent</a> of people who use it prefer it to previous standard methods.\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Some private schools in New York are <a href=\"https://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/ny-school-starts-using-facial-recognition-tech-to-look-for-threats-upsetting-some/2254592/\">using facial recognition</a> to screen for guns and people who shouldn\u2019t be on campus. Whether we like it or not, facial recognition is already being experimented with.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Here\u2019s another example of technology showing up in our physical world. A UK-based company signed a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLg5CZ-AG0g\">two-year exclusive</a> with Tencent to overlay all kinds of advertisements and pre-recorded video into movies and TV shows. Can you imagine watching your favorite movie from the \u201970s or \u201980s showcasing brands that you shop from today? This technology is already live and being used commercially.</span></p>\n<h2><strong>Earshare is the new mindshare</strong></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">And lastly, one of my favorite trends: w</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">e are listening to more podcasts than ever before. Audio consumption is exploding. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s being driven by more than just the smartphone. It\u2019s also hardware, better creation tools, and found time.\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/podcast-consumption.png?ssl=1\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-297855\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"574\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/podcast-consumption.png?resize=1024%2C574&amp;ssl=1\" width=\"1024\"/></a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">We now have wireless earbuds that allow us to listen to podcasts on the go. We have connected cars. We have smart speakers at home. New creation tools mean that anyone can record and edit their own podcast series from their bedroom.\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Not to mention the glorious, magical experience of realizing that you have found time. I can listen to a podcast when I\u2019m cooking breakfast, when I\u2019m nursing my kid, or when I\u2019m driving. I can now use all those moments that used to be somewhat mindless to embrace and consume audio content.\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/podcasts-on-smartphones.png?ssl=1\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-297856\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"572\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/podcasts-on-smartphones.png?resize=1024%2C572&amp;ssl=1\" width=\"1024\"/></a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In fact, if you think about it, audio is a marketer\u2019s dream. You are literally in their heads; they are a captive audience. Studies have already shown audio to be a very effective<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/state-of-podcasts-2018-takeaways-from-podcast-movement-on-monetization-diversity-and-discovery-eea7ccd0eed2\"> low-cost</a> customer acquisition strategy.\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">So what does this consumption of audio and podcasts mean for us? A decade ago, we started thinking, \u201cWhat does mobile-first product look like?\u201d We started leveraging the camera and the GPS, and that brought us great companies like Instagram or Lyft. We now need to start thinking, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat does audio-first content look like?\u00e2\u0080\u009d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Allows you to introduce all kinds of magical moments, whether they\u2019re sound effects or different narrative voices. This is a seed company that we invested in this year called Knowable:\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/audio-first.png?ssl=1\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-297846\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"577\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/audio-first.png?resize=1024%2C577&amp;ssl=1\" width=\"1024\"/></a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">They offer premium, curated audio courses on a variety of topics that people would pay money for, such as how to launch a startup, how to start a podcast, how to speak confidently, how to sleep better, and how to buy your first home.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">And since they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re audio-first, of course they have sound effects, and of course they\u2019re narrated by different voices. But these courses go a step further. They combine audio-first thinking with super-app thinking. If you bought the class titled \u201c<a href=\"https://knowable.fyi/courses/how-to-start-a-business\">How to Launch a Startup</a>,\u201d you\u2019re probably pretty serious about starting a business. So, they\u2019re already working with AWS so that anyone who buys this course gets $1,000 in free credits for AWS.\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Think about all the other kinds of partner and membership benefits that might be offered for topics like \u00e2\u0080\u009cHow to Sleep Better\u00e2\u0080\u009d or \u201cHow to Buy your First Home.\u201d That\u2019s audio-first thinking combined with super-app thinking\u00e2\u0080\u0094it is powerful.\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">This is why I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m so excited about the future of consumer tech. Companies are starting to realize that they can leverage their distribution to create new revenue streams with more business partners. More commerce will start showing up in our video apps, social media apps, and messaging apps. We\u2019re going to be shopping seamlessly, and commercials are going to become even better. We\u2019re going to start thinking about an audio-first world. We\u2019re going to see more tech and software permeate our physical worlds. And we\u2019re all going to start figuring out that we need to work together to become super apps.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Let me give you one last analogy to crystallize what this thinking means. Imagine that you are getting married. You don\u2019t have a wedding planner, so you go to a wedding venue to book it. That wedding venue probably has a recommendation for a florist, a photographer, a caterer, and a wedding planner. That\u2019s because the offline world always understood how to think in a customer-centric way, as opposed to a product-centric way.\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">We need to adopt that same thinking\u00e2\u0080\u0094Who is your customer and what other services might they need that might not even be related to your core-service?\u00c2\u00a0 We need to start uncovering our hidden data assets and brainstorming new revenue streams. And we need to start working together to unlock this great opportunity before us.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\">***</p>\n<p><em>The views expressed here are those of the individual AH Capital Management, L.L.C.

Sometimes, however, the metrics may not be the best gauge of what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s actually happening in the business, or people may use different definitions of the same metric in a way that makes it hard to understand the health of the business.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">So, while some of this may be obvious to many of you who live and breathe these metrics all day long, we compiled a list of the most common or confusing ones. Where appropriate, we tried to add some notes on why investors focus on those metrics. Ultimately, though, good metrics </span><i><span style=\"font-weight:400\">aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t</span></i><span style=\"font-weight:400\"> about </span><a href=\"https://a16z.com/2015/02/27/16-common-questions-about-fundraising/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight:400\">raising money</span></a><span style=\"font-weight:400\"> from VCs \u2014 they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re about running the business in a way where founders know how and why certain things are working (or not) \u2026 and can address or adjust accordingly.</span></p>\n<h2><em><b>Business and Financial Metrics</b></em></h2>\n<h2><b>#1 Bookings vs. Revenue </b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">A common mistake is to use bookings and revenue interchangeably, but they aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t the same thing. </span></p>\n<p><b>Bookings\u00c2\u00a0</b><span style=\"font-weight:400\">is the value of a contract between the company and the customer. It reflects a contractual obligation on the part of the customer to pay the company. </span></p>\n<p><b>Revenue</b><span style=\"font-weight:400\">\u00c2\u00a0is recognized when the service is actually provided or ratably over the life of the subscription agreement. How and when revenue is recognized is governed by GAAP.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Letters of intent and verbal agreements are neither revenue nor bookings. </span></p>\n<h2><b>#2 Recurring Revenue vs. Total Revenue</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Investors more highly value companies where the majority of total revenue comes from product revenue (vs. from services). Why? Services revenue is non-recurring, has much lower margins, and is less scalable. Product revenue is the what you generate from the sale of the software or product itself.</span></p>\n<p><b>ARR (annual recurring revenue)\u00c2\u00a0</b><span style=\"font-weight:400\">is a measure of revenue components that are recurring in nature. It should exclude one-time (non-recurring) fees and professional service fees.</span></p>\n<p><b>ARR per customer: </b><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Is this flat or growing? If you are upselling or cross-selling your customers, then it should be growing, which is a positive indicator for a healthy business.</span></p>\n<p><b>MRR (monthly recurring revenue): </b><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Often, people will multiply one month\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all-in bookings\u00c2\u00a0by 12 to get to ARR. Common mistakes with this method include: (1) counting non-recurring fees such as hardware, setup, installation, professional services/ consulting agreements; (2) counting bookings (see #1).</span></p>\n<h2><b>#3 Gross Profit</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">While top-line bookings growth is super important, investors want to understand </span><i><span style=\"font-weight:400\">how profitable</span></i><span style=\"font-weight:400\"> that revenue stream is. Gross profit provides that measure.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">What\u00e2\u0080\u0099s included in gross profit may vary by company, but in general all costs associated with the manufacturing, delivery, and support of a product/service should be included. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">So be prepared to break down what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s included in \u2014 and excluded \u2014 from that gross profit figure.</span></p>\n<h2><b>#4 Total Contract Value (TCV) vs. Annual Contract Value (ACV)</b></h2>\n<p><b>TCV (total contract value)</b><span style=\"font-weight:400\"> is the total value of the contract, and can be shorter or longer in duration. Make sure TCV also includes the value from one-time charges, professional service fees, and recurring charges. \u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><b>ACV (annual contract value)</b><span style=\"font-weight:400\">, on the other hand, measures the value of the contract over a 12-month period.\u00c2\u00a0</span><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Questions to ask about ACV: \u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><em>What is the size?</em> Are you getting a few hundred dollars per month from your customers, or are you able to close large deals? Of course, this depends on the market you are targeting (SMB vs. mid-market vs. enterprise).</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\"><em>Is it growing</em> (and especially\u00c2\u00a0not shrinking)? If it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s growing, it means customers are paying you more on average for your product over time. That implies either your product is fundamentally doing more (adding features and capabilities) to warrant that increase, or is delivering so much value customers (improved functionality over alternatives) that they are willing to pay more for it. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">See also </span><a href=\"http://www.quora.com/What-was-the-average-ACV-Annual-Contract-Value-for-the-fastest-growing-enterprise-software-SaaS-companies-in-their-first-year-or-two-of-operations\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight:400\">this post</span></a><span style=\"font-weight:400\"> on ACV. </span></p>\n<h2><b>#5 LTV (Life Time Value)</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Lifetime value is the present value of the future </span><i><span style=\"font-weight:400\">net profit</span></i><span style=\"font-weight:400\"> from the customer over the duration of the relationship. It helps determine the long-term value of the customer and how much net value you generate per customer after accounting for customer acquisition costs (CAC). </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">A common mistake is to estimate the LTV as a </span><i><span style=\"font-weight:400\">present value of revenue</span></i><span style=\"font-weight:400\"> or even </span><i><span style=\"font-weight:400\">gross margin of the customer</span></i><span style=\"font-weight:400\"> instead of calculating it as </span><i><span style=\"font-weight:400\">net profit of the customer</span></i><span style=\"font-weight:400\"> over the life of the relationship. </span></p>\n<p>Reminder, here\u2019s\u00c2\u00a0a way to calculate LTV:</p>\n<blockquote><p><b>Revenue per customer (per month)</b><span style=\"font-weight:400\"> = average order value multiplied by the number of orders.</span></p>\n<p><b>Contribution margin per customer (per month) </b><span style=\"font-weight:400\">= revenue from customer minus variable costs associated with a customer. Variable costs include selling, administrative and any operational costs associated with serving the customer.</span></p>\n<p><b>Avg. life span of customer (in months) </b><span style=\"font-weight:400\">= 1 / by your monthly churn.</span></p>\n<p><b>LTV </b><span style=\"font-weight:400\">= Contribution margin from customer multiplied by the average lifespan of customer.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Note,</span> <span style=\"font-weight:400\">if you have only few months of data, the conservative way to measure LTV is to look at historical value to date. Rather than predicting average life span and estimating how the retention curves might look, we prefer to measure 12 month and 24 month LTV.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Another important calculation here is </span><b>LTV as it contributes to margin</b><span style=\"font-weight:400\">. This is important because a revenue or gross margin LTV suggests a higher upper limit on what you can spend on customer acquisition. </span><b>Contribution Margin LTV to CAC ratio</b><span style=\"font-weight:400\"> is also a good measure to determine CAC payback and manage your advertising and marketing spend accordingly. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">See also Bill Gurley on the \u00e2\u0080\u009c</span><a href=\"http://abovethecrowd.com/2012/09/04/the-dangerous-seduction-of-the-lifetime-value-ltv-formula/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight:400\">dangerous seductions</span></a><span style=\"font-weight:400\">\u00e2\u0080\u009d of the lifetime value formula. </span></p>\n<h2><b>#6 Gross Merchandise Value (GMV) vs. Revenue </b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">In marketplace businesses, these are frequently used interchangeably. But GMV does not equal revenue!</span></p>\n<p><b>GMV (gross merchandise volume)</b><span style=\"font-weight:400\">\u00c2\u00a0is the total sales dollar volume of merchandise transacting through the marketplace in a specific period. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the real top line, what the consumer side of the marketplace is spending. It is a useful measure of the size of the marketplace and can be useful as a \u00e2\u0080\u009ccurrent run rate\u00e2\u0080\u009d measure based on annualizing the most recent month or quarter.</span></p>\n<p><b>Revenue</b><span style=\"font-weight:400\">\u00c2\u00a0is the portion of GMV that the marketplace \u00e2\u0080\u009ctakes\u00e2\u0080\u009d. Revenue consists of the various fees that the marketplace gets for providing its services; most typically these are transaction fees based on GMV successfully transacted on the marketplace, but can also include ad revenue, sponsorships, etc. These fees are usually a fraction of GMV.</span></p>\n<h2><b>#7</b> <b>Unearned or Deferred Revenue \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 and Billings</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">In a SaaS business,</span> <span style=\"font-weight:400\">this is the cash you collect at the time of the booking in advance of when the revenues will actually be realized. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">As we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve </span><a href=\"https://a16z.com/2014/05/13/understanding-saas-valuation-primer/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight:400\">shared previously</span></a><span style=\"font-weight:400\">, SaaS companies only get to recognize revenue over the term of the deal as the service is delivered \u2014 </span><i><span style=\"font-weight:400\">even if a customer signs a huge up-front deal</span></i><span style=\"font-weight:400\">. So in most cases, that \u00e2\u0080\u009cbooking\u00e2\u0080\u009d goes onto the balance sheet in a liability line item called deferred revenue. (Because the balance sheet has to \u00e2\u0080\u009cbalance,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the corresponding entry on the assets side of the balance sheet is \u00e2\u0080\u009ccash\u00e2\u0080\u009d if the customer pre-paid for the service or \u00e2\u0080\u009caccounts receivable\u00e2\u0080\u009d if the company expects to bill for and receive it in the future). As the company starts to recognize revenue from the software as service, it reduces its deferred revenue balance and increases revenue: for a 24-month deal, as each month goes by deferred revenue drops by 1/24th and revenue increases by 1/24th.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">A good proxy to measure the growth \u2014 and ultimately the health \u2014 of a SaaS company is to look at </span><b>billings</b><span style=\"font-weight:400\">, which is calculated by taking the revenue in one quarter and adding the change in deferred revenue from the prior quarter to the current quarter. If a SaaS company is growing its bookings (whether through new business or upsells/renewals to existing customers), billings will increase.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Billings is a much better forward-looking indicator of the health of a SaaS company than simply looking at revenue because revenue understates the true value of the customer, which gets recognized ratably. But i</span><span style=\"font-weight:400\">t\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also tricky because of the very nature of recurring revenue itself: A SaaS company could show stable revenue for a long time \u2014 just by working off its billings backlog \u2014 which would make the business <em>seem</em> healthier than it truly is. This is something we therefore watch out for when evaluating the unit economics of such businesses. </span></p>\n<h2><b>#8 CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost) \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Blended vs. Paid, Organic vs. Inorganic</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Customer acquisition cost or CAC</span> <span style=\"font-weight:400\">should be the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight:400\">full</span></i><span style=\"font-weight:400\"> cost of acquiring users, stated on a per user basis. </span><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Unfortunately, CAC metrics come in all shapes and sizes. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">One common problem with CAC metrics is failing to include all the costs incurred in user acquisition such as referral fees, credits, or discounts. Another common problem is to calculate CAC as a \u00e2\u0080\u009cblended\u00e2\u0080\u009d cost (including users acquired organically) rather than isolating users acquired through \u00e2\u0080\u009cpaid\u00e2\u0080\u009d marketing. While </span><b>blended CAC</b><span style=\"font-weight:400\"> [total acquisition cost / total new customers acquired across all channels] isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t wrong, it doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t inform how well your paid campaigns are working and whether they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re profitable. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">This is why investors consider </span><b>paid CAC</b><span style=\"font-weight:400\"> [total acquisition cost/ new customers acquired through paid marketing] to be more important than blended CAC in evaluating the viability of a business \u2014 it informs whether a company can scale up its\u00c2\u00a0user acquisition budget profitably. While an argument can be made in some cases\u00c2\u00a0that paid acquisition contributes to organic acquisition, one would need to demonstrate proof of that effect to put weight on blended CAC.</span></p>\n<p>Many investors do like seeing both, however: the blended number as well as the CAC, broken out by paid/unpaid. We also like seeing the breakdown by dollars of paid customer acquisition channels: for example, how much does a paying customer cost if they were acquired via Facebook?</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Counterintuitively, it turns out that costs typically go </span><i><span style=\"font-weight:400\">up</span></i><span style=\"font-weight:400\"> as you try and reach a larger audience. So it might cost you $1 to acquire your first 1,000 users, $2 to acquire your next 10,000, and $5 to $10 to acquire your next 100,000. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s why you can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t afford to ignore the metrics about volume of users acquired via each channel. </span></p>\n<h2><em><b>Product and Engagement Metrics</b></em></h2>\n<h2><b>#9 Active Users</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Different companies have almost unlimited definitions for what \u201cactive\u201d means. Some charts don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even define what that activity is, while others include inadvertent activity \u2014 such as having a high proportion of first-time users or accidental one-time users. </span></p>\n<p>Be clear on how you define \u00e2\u0080\u009cactive.\u00e2\u0080\u009d</p>\n<h2><b>#10 Month-on-month (MoM) growth</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Often this measured as the simple average of monthly growth rates. But investors often prefer to measure it as </span><b>CMGR (Compounded Monthly Growth Rate)</b><span style=\"font-weight:400\"> since CMGR measures the periodic growth, especially for a marketplace. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Using CMGR [CMGR = (Latest Month/ First Month)^(1/# of Months) -1] also helps you benchmark growth rates with other companies. This would otherwise be difficult to compare due to volatility and other factors. The CMGR will be smaller than the simple average in a growing business.</span></p>\n<h2><b>#11</b> <b>Churn</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all kinds of churn \u2014 dollar churn, customer churn, net dollar churn \u2014 and there are varying definitions for how churn is measured. For example, some companies measure it on a revenue basis annually, which blends upsells with churn.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Investors look at it the following way:</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><b>Monthly unit churn</b><span style=\"font-weight:400\"> = lost customers/prior month total</span></p>\n<p><b>Retention by cohort</b></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:30px\"><b>Month 1</b><span style=\"font-weight:400\"> = 100% of installed base</span></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:30px\"><b>Latest Month</b><span style=\"font-weight:400\"> = % of original installed base that are still transacting</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It is also important to differentiate between gross churn and net revenue churn \u2014</p>\n<p><b>Gross churn</b><span style=\"font-weight:400\">: MRR </span><i><span style=\"font-weight:400\">lost</span></i><span style=\"font-weight:400\"> in a given month/MRR at the beginning of the month.</span></p>\n<p><b>Net churn</b><span style=\"font-weight:400\">: (MRR lost </span><i><span style=\"font-weight:400\">minus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight:400\"> MRR from upsells) in a given month/MRR at the beginning of the month.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">The difference between the two is significant. Gross churn estimates the actual loss to the business, while net revenue churn understates the losses (as it blends upsells with absolute churn).</span></p>\n<h2><b>#12</b> <b>Burn Rate</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Burn rate is the rate at which cash is decreasing. Especially in\u00c2\u00a0early stage startups, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s important to know and monitor burn rate as companies fail when they are running out of cash and don\u2019t have enough time left to raise funds or reduce expenses. As a reminder, here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a simple calculation:</span></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:30px\"><b>Monthly cash burn</b><span style=\"font-weight:400\"> = cash balance at the beginning of the year </span><i><span style=\"font-weight:400\">minus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight:400\"> cash balance end of the year / 12</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">It\u2019s also important to measure net burn vs. gross burn:</span></p>\n<p><b>Net burn</b><span style=\"font-weight:400\"> [revenues (including all incoming cash you have a high probability of receiving) \u2013 gross burn] is the true measure of amount of cash your company is burning every month. </span></p>\n<p><b>Gross burn</b><span style=\"font-weight:400\"> on the other hand only looks at your monthly expenses + any other cash outlays.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Investors tend to focus on net burn to understand how long the money you have left in the bank will last for you to run the company. They will also take into account the rate at which your revenues and expenses grow as monthly burn may not be a constant number.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">See also Fred Wilson on </span><a href=\"http://avc.com/2011/12/burn-rate/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight:400\">burn rate</span></a><span style=\"font-weight:400\">. </span></p>\n<h2><b>#13</b> <b>Downloads</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Downloads (or number of apps delivered by distribution deals) are really just a vanity metric. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Investors want to see </span><i><span style=\"font-weight:400\">engagement</span></i><span style=\"font-weight:400\">, ideally expressed as cohort retention on metrics that matter for that business \u2014 for example, DAU (daily active users), MAU (monthly active users), photos shared, photos viewed, and so on. </span></p>\n<h2><em><b>Presenting Metrics Generally</b></em></h2>\n<h2><b>#14</b> <b>Cumulative Charts (vs. Growth Metrics)</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Cumulative charts by definition always go up and to the right for any business that is showing any kind of activity. But they are not a valid measure of growth \u2014 they can go up-and-to-the-right </span><i><span style=\"font-weight:400\">even when</span></i><span style=\"font-weight:400\"> a business is shrinking. Thus, the metric is not a useful indicator of a company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s health.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Investors like to look at monthly GMV, monthly revenue, or new users/customers per month to assess the growth in early stage businesses. Quarterly charts can be used for later-stage businesses or businesses with a lot of month-to-month volatility in metrics.</span></p>\n<h2><b>#15 Chart Tricks</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">There a number of </span><a href=\"http://nautil.us/issue/19/illusions/five-ways-to-lie-with-charts\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight:400\">such tricks</span></a><span style=\"font-weight:400\">, but a few common ones include not labeling the Y-axis; shrinking scale to exaggerate growth; and only presenting percentage gains without presenting the absolute numbers. (This last one is misleading since percentages can sound impressive off a small base, but are not an indicator of the future trajectory.)</span></p>\n<h2><b>#16 Order of Operations</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fine to present metrics in any order as you tell your story. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">When initially evaluating businesses, investors often look at GMV, revenue, and bookings first because they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re an indicator of the size of the business. Once investors have a sense of the the size of the business, they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll want to understand growth to see how well the company is performing. These basic metrics, if interesting, then compel us to look even further. </span></p>\n<p>As one of our partners who recently had a baby observes here: It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s almost like doing a health check for your baby at the pediatrician\u00e2\u0080\u0099s office.

Among them, those who were granted large stock options awards accelerated the vesting of their options and then exercised and sold stock when the company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s shares were trading at all-time highs, all the while knowing they were overstating the value of the business to drive up the company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s valuation. As the fraud came to light, it highlighted loopholes in non-retirement tax-deferred compensation that until then had largely been ignored by Congress. The Enron stock option fraud was not covered by existing insider trading laws, so as a response, Internal Revenue Section 409A was passed as part of the 2004 American Jobs Creation Act.</p>\n<p>In a nutshell, Section 409A excludes stock options from the U.S. definition of \u00e2\u0080\u009ctax-deferred compensation,\u00e2\u0080\u009d unless certain rules are followed. Companies can largely ignore Section 409A if they give employees stock options that have a strike price (the price at which the stock can be bought) exactly equal to the fair market value (FMV) of the common stock at the time of the grant. For publicly-traded companies, where the fair market value is the current stock price, this is easy. But it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not straightforward for privately-held companies, such as startups.</p>\n<p>As a concession, provisions were created so that privately-held companies could determine the FMV of their common shares in a way that would be accepted as valid by the IRS \u00e2\u0080\u0093 what is known as \u00e2\u0080\u009csafe harbor.\u00e2\u0080\u009d However, the new standards of proof were a radical change from how privately-held companies had previously determined the FMV of their common stock. Whereas in the past, a company would decide on its own (with advice from the Board and outside counsel) what they felt was an appropriate price, they would now have to provide substantial supporting evidence.</p>\n<h2><strong><div class=\"toc-mobile-wrapper\"><h4>TABLE OF CONTENTS</h4><ul class=\"toc-list\"></ul></div><div data-toc-header=\"Getting Started with 409A\" id=\"section--2\"></div>Getting Started with 409A</strong></h2>\n<h3><strong>1. Why should I hire a 409A valuation firm?</strong></h3>\n<p>In order to structure stock option grants as tax-free events to your employees, you need to prove what you calculated as the fair market value of your common stock is reasonable, otherwise known as \u00e2\u0080\u009csafe harbor.\u00e2\u0080\u009d</p>\n<p>The easiest and most common way to ensure 409A safe harbor is to have a qualified, independent valuation provider conduct the 409A analysis. A good analogy here is when your mortgage lender uses an appraiser to figure out how much your house is worth: They don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to know what you think since you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re biased \u00e2\u0080\u0093 they want the value determined by someone who can give them a dispassionate, arm\u00e2\u0080\u0099s-length assessment.</p>\n<p>Having said that, hiring an expert doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t automatically guarantee 409A safe harbor. As the CEO/founder, you still have a duty to ensure the valuation work is reasonable and defensible because the IRS (and the SEC, where applicable) can challenge the analysis, even if it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s performed by an independent provider.</p>\n<h3>2. How should I select my 409A valuation firm?</h3>\n<p>You want to select a provider who has experience valuing companies that look a lot like yours. A valuation provider should have not only the right credentials and expertise conducting valuations to ensure 409A safe harbor, but also extensive experience in your sector, industry, and stage.</p>\n<p>For instance, don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t engage a valuation provider whose clients are primarily companies located in the Midwest that are slow-growing, profitable brick-and-mortar businesses if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re a high-growth yet unprofitable enterprise SaaS company headquartered in Silicon Valley (and yes, I have helped companies where this has happened!). Think of it as analogous to selecting a tax provider to do your personal income taxes: You would choose a tax accountant who is not just certified as a CPA, but also has extensive experience filing taxes for someone just like you, so you can leverage their experience across those similar clients to optimize your tax return without triggering audit flags.</p>\n<p>You also want to select a valuation provider who has strong relationships at major audit firms \u00e2\u0080\u0093 the Big-4 accounting firms (Deloitte, PWC, KPMG, and E&amp;Y) and/or large regional firms in your area \u00e2\u0080\u0093 with the relevant sector heads/partners at that firm\u00e2\u0080\u0099s venture practice. This is a good indicator the valuation firm has proven their work is defensible and respected by experts in the audit community.</p>\n<p>Daniel Knappenberger, Silicon Valley Market Leader at Deloitte Advisory notes that \u00e2\u0080\u009cfor private companies, a 409A analysis is very important and it is critical to have the right level of support for any conclusion of value. Working with a valuation advisor who has the relevant experience can help companies shape their point of view and save them a lot of potential pain down the road.\u00e2\u0080\u009d</p>\n<h3>3. How often should I do a 409A valuation?</h3>\n<p>Companies are expected to conduct 409A valuations at least once every 12 months, or when a material event has occurred that would affect the value of the company \u00e2\u0080\u0093 whichever occurs sooner.</p>\n<p>\u00e2\u0080\u009cMaterial events\u00e2\u0080\u009d can include new equity financings; an acquisition offer by another company; certain instances of secondary sales of common stock; and significant changes (good or bad) to a company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s financial outlook. A company credibly <a href=\"https://a16z.com/2016/12/01/ipo-readiness-checklist-wishlist/\">approaching IPO</a> will also conduct 409A valuations more frequently (e.g. quarterly or even monthly).</p>\n<h3>4. What do I need to do a 409A valuation?</h3>\n<p>The data you need to provide to your 409A provider is relatively straightforward, and your 409A provider will spend time with you to get additional context on your company and any unique circumstances you may have.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Your sector / industry</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Most recently amended articles of incorporation:</strong> Also known as the corporate charter, or certificate of incorporation; your outside counsel will have this if you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t.</li>\n<li><strong>Most recent cap table:</strong> Again, your outside counsel will have this if you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t.</li>\n<li><strong>Board presentation and recent pitch deck</strong> (if you just completed a fundraise)</li>\n<li><strong>Company historicals and 3-year profit and loss (P&amp;L), cash balance, and debt projections:</strong> If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re an early stage company, this is a best effort, as it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hard to predict where a company will be in 12 months, much less three years.</li>\n<li><strong>Estimate on how many options you expect to issue over the next 12 months:</strong> A good back-of-the-envelope estimate is take your hiring plan and multiply this by the median number of options per employee, adjusting for any \u00e2\u0080\u009coption expensive\u00e2\u0080\u009d hires (e.g. VP and C-level executives, Director of Engineering).</li>\n<li><strong>A list of 5+ publicly-traded companies most comparable (\u00e2\u0080\u009ctrading comps\u00e2\u0080\u009d) to yours:</strong> If your company doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t fit into an exact category, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s okay \u00e2\u0080\u0093 most founders start disruptive companies, so it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not uncommon to not fit perfectly into an existing industry. However, make sure the comps make sense to you because they will be part of your subsequent 409As. Your comps should only change if someone is acquired or new companies go public that make sense to include.</li>\n<li><strong>Timing expectations around potential liquidity events</strong> (e.g. IPO, M&amp;A)</li>\n<li><strong>Significant events that have happened since your last 409A</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>5. How long does a 409A valuation take?</h3>\n<p>Generally, if you have all the items in the above checklist, it takes about two weeks to get to a final draft of your 409A valuation for your Board to approve. For later-stage companies who have engaged an auditor (more on that in #6), the timeline may be a little longer.</p>\n<p>A typical timeline involves data collection and kick-off calls, valuation modeling, preparation of draft schedules, and management review in the first two weeks; and then obtaining Board approval and granting options the third week.</p>\n<h3>6. How involved should my auditor be?</h3>\n<p>For most startups, once you reach around $10M of annual revenue, investors will expect you to start presenting audited financials. The 409A valuation is a key driver in calculating stock compensation expense, so your auditor will most certainly review it. Involving them early in the 409A valuation helps to ensure a smooth audit process.</p>\n<p>As a best practice, include the audit team in the kick-off call with you and your 409A provider<em> prior to</em> conducting a new 409A valuation. In this call, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s important that everyone agrees on the approach and valuation methodology (which we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll cover in \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Calculations\u00e2\u0080\u009d section below). If the valuation is complex enough, or you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re anticipating an IPO within the next two years, then the auditor may request that their valuation specialist review a draft of the 409A valuation before you finalize it for Board approval. This sign-off step will add a minimum of one week to the timeline.</p>\n<p>It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s critical to get everyone on the same page. In the event your auditor identifies a flaw in a 409A that you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve used to grant options, they will require you to revisit (and potentially revise) not just that 409A valuation, but also prior 409A valuations. This can be a lengthy and painful process, and any option grants that are outstanding will be put on hold until the 409A valuations are sorted out.</p>\n<h2><strong><div class=\"toc-mobile-wrapper\"><h4>TABLE OF CONTENTS</h4><ul class=\"toc-list\"></ul></div><div data-toc-header=\"409A Valuation Calculations\" id=\"section--3\"></div>409A Valuation Calculations</strong></h2>\n<p>In this section, we break down the three steps that are involved in the 409A valuation itself.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Calculate enterprise value.</strong> The first and arguably most important step is estimating the company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s valuation (\u00e2\u0080\u009centerprise value\u00e2\u0080\u009d). This is very straightforward if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re doing your 409A valuation immediately after a fundraise, but becomes fuzzier a year (or more) after the fact.</li>\n<li><strong>Determine the value of the common stock.</strong> The second step is to take that enterprise value and divvy it up among all the different share classes (e.g. preferreds, warrant holders, common) to determine the current value of the common shares \u00e2\u0080\u0093 what is also known as the \u00e2\u0080\u009cfair market value\u00e2\u0080\u009d (FMV). This step takes into account all of the economic rights of each share class, otherwise known as liquidation preference (i.e. the order in which stockholders are returned their investment in a liquidity event) and rights related to conversion, dividends, and participation.</li>\n<li><strong>Apply a discount for lack of marketability (DLOM).</strong> The third and final step is to take the calculated FMV for the common shares and apply a discount to adjust for the fact that the company is not publicly traded \u00e2\u0080\u0093 in other words, none of your employees could actually go and sell their shares at that price because there is no liquid market for them.</li>\n</ol>\n<span class=\"bctt-click-to-tweet\"><span class=\"bctt-ctt-text\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https://a16z.com/2020/02/13/16-things-about-the-409a-valuation/&amp;text=The%203%20steps%20to%20409A%20Valuations%3A%201%29%20Calculate%20enterprise%20value.%202%29%20Determine%20the%20value%20of%20common%20stock.%203%29%20Apply%20a%20discount%20for%20lack%20of%20marketability.&amp;via=a16z&amp;related=a16z\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">The 3 steps to 409A Valuations: 1) Calculate enterprise value. 2) Determine the value of common stock. 3) Apply a discount for lack of marketability. </a></span><a class=\"bctt-ctt-btn\" href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https://a16z.com/2020/02/13/16-things-about-the-409a-valuation/&amp;text=The%203%20steps%20to%20409A%20Valuations%3A%201%29%20Calculate%20enterprise%20value.%202%29%20Determine%20the%20value%20of%20common%20stock.%203%29%20Apply%20a%20discount%20for%20lack%20of%20marketability.&amp;via=a16z&amp;related=a16z\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Click To Tweet</a></span>\n<h3>7. Calculate enterprise value</h3>\n<p>While there are many ways financial experts (e.g. M&amp;A experts, equity research analysts, VC firms) can determine enterprise value, in 409A valuation work, there are three main methodologies: market, income, and asset-based. These can be used in combination with each other and the method(s) may change as a company matures. For instance, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s common for early stage companies to rely heavily on a market approach, while more mature, growth-stage companies are more likely to use an income approach.</p>\n<p><strong>MARKET APPROACH</strong></p>\n<p><strong>When it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s used:</strong> For unprofitable, early stage companies where it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s difficult to predict long-range financial performance.</p>\n<p><strong>How it works:</strong> The market approach is a relative valuation method, which means the company is compared to a set of publicly-traded companies (\u00e2\u0080\u009ctrading comps\u00e2\u0080\u009d) that are similar to it, usually by industry. This comp set is then used to determine the appropriate valuation multiple to apply to the company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s own set of metrics to arrive at an enterprise value. For profitable companies, this is typically an EBITDA multiple, but in the case of early stage companies where EBITDA is often negative, revenue multiples are used. This is called the Guideline Public Company method.</p>\n<p><strong>Pros &amp; Cons:</strong> The benefit of this methodology is it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s very easy to calculate publicly-traded company multiples. The limitation is oftentimes the comp set may not be a great representative peer group because the company doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t fit perfectly into a particular category. Many startups are trying to create new industries/markets, and so in these cases, by definition their comps will be imperfect since nobody else is doing what they do. More often than not, the company is also growing at a very different rate compared to its publicly-traded comps (hopefully much, much faster), but also at a very different scale (startup: small vs. public companies: very large), so adjustments are made to try to take into account that the comparison is not perfect.</p>\n<p>If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve just completed a fundraise, determining enterprise value is actually very straightforward: the valuation of that round is used. This is called a backsolve and will almost always be the way a founder will first encounter a 409A valuation, since they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve now received funding and can hire their first employees. A backsolve is considered a \u00e2\u0080\u009cmarket approach\u00e2\u0080\u009d for calculating the enterprise value of a company, but instead of building public comps and applying multiples to metrics (as with the Guideline Public Company method outlined above), that round\u00e2\u0080\u0099s valuation is used as the anchor to back into (backsolve) the implied total equity value of the business based on the given mix of share classes and their rights and preferences.</p>\n<p>The 409A provider is able to use the valuation from that fundraise because the new preferred investors (e.g. VC firms) are assumed to be sophisticated, with the transaction done at arm\u00e2\u0080\u0099s length, with both buyer and seller acting independently from each other and in their own self interest.</p>\n<p><strong>INCOME APPROACH</strong></p>\n<p><strong>When it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s used:</strong> The income approach is used primarily by companies who have achieved scale, a high degree of visibility and predictability in their financial performance, and line of sight to when they expect to become profitable.</p>\n<p><strong>How it works:</strong> This methodology assumes that a company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s value is determined by the receipt of future profit streams. The company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s long-range financial projections are used to determine what these income levels are, which are then discounted back to what they would be worth in today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s dollars (\u00e2\u0080\u009cpresent value\u00e2\u0080\u009d). The income approach is also called the discounted cash flow (\u00e2\u0080\u009cDCF\u00e2\u0080\u009d) method.</p>\n<p><strong>Pros &amp; Cons:</strong> The benefit of this methodology is it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s directly influenced by the future expected profit from the company. The downside is it requires reliable long-range forecasts that must be substantiated. Danny Wallace, Co-Leader of the Emerging Companies Services Group at PwC notes \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe income approach requires the most audit effort. The reason is it involves assumptions that are inherently subjective, such as revenue growth, customer attrition, gross margins, and operating expenses, which become progressively more difficult to forecast the further out you go in the 10 years of the cash flow period. Without a relatively sophisticated FP&amp;A [financial planning &amp; analysis] function in place, companies may struggle to provide sufficient support to satisfy their auditors.\u00e2\u0080\u009d</p>\n<p><strong>ASSET APPROACH</strong></p>\n<p><strong>When it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s used:</strong> For venture-backed companies, the asset approach is rarely used; when it is, it is typically in the very early stage before any formal (i.e. pre-angel) financing occurs. For instance, a very nascent life-sciences company funded only through academic grants would be a candidate for the asset approach.</p>\n<p><strong>How it works:</strong> This approach uses replacement cost to determine a company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s enterprise value. For this method, the appraised value of all the assets and liabilities of the company determine its enterprise value.</p>\n<p><strong>Pros &amp; Cons:</strong> The benefit to the asset approach is it doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t require any kind of forecasting because the potential growth of the company is completely ignored. This is also the downside to the asset approach. Additionally, it can be prohibitively expensive to appraise certain assets and liabilities \u00e2\u0080\u0093 especially intangible assets such as IP \u00e2\u0080\u0093 making this an impractical method for early stage companies.</p>\n<p>Once a company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s enterprise value is determined, the next step in a 409A valuation is to assign the various equity classes their fair share of the company, taking into account economic rights such as liquidation preferences, participation rights, and conversion ratios.</p>\n<h3>8. Determine the fair market value (FMV) of the common stock</h3>\n<p>In the case of a company with only common shares (extremely rare for a privately-held, venture-backed company), the FMV would just be the enterprise value divided by the <a href=\"https://a16z.com/2016/08/24/options-ownership/\">fully diluted shares outstanding</a>. However, most privately-held venture-backed companies have at least two, if not more, classes of equity (e.g. Series A/B/C/D/etc. preferred shares along with common shares). In these cases, calculating the FMV of the common shares requires further analysis.</p>\n<p>There are three ways to allocate the enterprise value across multiple share classes. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll go from most often used for VC-backed companies, to least.</p>\n<p><strong>OPTION-PRICING METHOD (OPM)</strong></p>\n<p><strong>How it works:</strong> All of the company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s various classes of stock are treated as if they are call options and assigned exercise prices (the price at which the option holder can buy the stock). In the case of preferred stock, the exercise price is determined by the liquidation preference. In the case of common stock, the money left over after all of the liquidation preferences have been satisfied is used to determine its exercise price. In the unfortunate situation where a company is acquired for less than or equal to the liquidation preferences, the shareholders of common stock receive $0 (assuming no management carve outs).</p>\n<p><strong>When it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s used:</strong> OPM is most frequently used for companies that are still too early in their development to identify specific exit scenarios and their timing.</p>\n<p><strong>Black-Scholes:</strong> Black-Scholes is the most commonly-used option-pricing model in a 409A valuation. We won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t go into a lengthy technical explanation of how it works, but at a high level, the Black-Scholes model calculates the value of an option by averaging all the possible future \u00e2\u0080\u009cprofit\u00e2\u0080\u009d on that call option\u00e2\u0080\u0099s strike price (i.e. future stock price &gt;= current option strike price, otherwise known as when an option would be \u00e2\u0080\u009cat or in the money\u00e2\u0080\u009d).</p>\n<p>For a 409A valuation, a handful of key assumptions drive the output of the Black-Scholes model: the enterprise value of the company (explained above), volatility, and the expected time to exit (TTE).</p>\n<p>Your company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\"><em>volatility</em></span> is determined using the set of publicly-traded companies that were identified as your \u00e2\u0080\u009ctrading comps\u00e2\u0080\u009d from step 1. The more volatile a stock, the higher the chances the option will expire in the money, which increases its value. As with the case of determining the appropriate multiple to use, adjustments are made to take into account the imperfect nature of the trading comp set.</p>\n<p>The expected <em><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">time to exit</span> </em>is simply the amount of time until a liquidity event (e.g. IPO or M&amp;A). The longer the time to exit, the more valuable the option, since more time gives the option an increased chance to expire in the money.</p>\n<p><strong>PROBABILITY-WEIGHTED EXPECTED RETURN METHOD (PWERM)</strong></p>\n<p><strong>How it works:</strong> In this method, various outcomes \u00e2\u0080\u0093 specifically IPO, M&amp;A, dissolution, or continued operations \u00e2\u0080\u0093 are modeled at their projected values and then each is assigned a level of probability of occuring, with how each share class participates in those outcomes dictated by their respective rights. Common stock values tend to be higher in PWERMs than in OPMs because in the IPO scenario all of the preferred stock converts to common, which eliminates the liquidation preferences.</p>\n<p><strong>When it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s used:</strong> This method is most frequently used for companies that have matured to the point where they can estimate with reasonably strong confidence potential exit scenarios along with their timing (e.g. IPO in 18 months).</p>\n<p><strong>HYBRID METHOD</strong></p>\n<p><strong>How it works:</strong> The Hybrid Method is a combination of using both OPM and PWERM, estimating the probability-weighted value across multiple scenarios, but using OPM to estimate the allocation of value within one or more of those scenarios.</p>\n<p><strong>When it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s used:</strong> The Hybrid Method can be a useful alternative to explicitly modeling all PWERM scenarios in situations where the company has insight into one or more near-term exits (e.g. M&amp;A in 6 months), but is unsure about what would occur if those specific plans fell through.</p>\n<p><strong>CURRENT VALUE METHOD (CVM)</strong></p>\n<p><strong>How it works:</strong> This method estimates the company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s present-day equity value (in other words no assumption of future progress) and assumes there is an immediate sale or dissolution of the company. Value is then allocated across the share classes based on liquidation preferences, conversion ratios, and participation rights.</p>\n<p><strong>When it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s used:</strong> For a venture-backed company, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s very rarely used. The only time the CVM makes sense is when the company is at such an early stage that either no material progress has been made vs. the company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s expectations (and thus no value above the liquidation preference has been created) or there is no way to reasonably estimate a time when the company could create value above its liquidation preference.</p>\n<h3>9. Apply a Discount for Lack of Marketability (DLOM)</h3>\n<p>The last step in a 409A valuation is to apply a discount for lack of marketability (DLOM) to the common stock value calculated in step 2. The equity allocation models used in step 2 assume there is an active market to immediately buy and sell the common stock \u00e2\u0080\u0093 in other words, fully marketable (publicly-traded) stock. This isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t the case for the majority of privately-held companies and so their common stock is less valuable because of a \u00e2\u0080\u009clack of marketability.\u00e2\u0080\u009d To adjust for this, a DLOM is applied to the calculated fair market value.</p>\n<p>This lack of marketability decreases as the company scales and becomes more and more likely to be successful. A company who has just raised a Series A may have no interested buyers in its common stock and therefore has a very large DLOM, whereas a company who has reached scale and is a credible candidate to be a publicly-traded company has a very small discount.</p>\n<p>The primary variable that affects the size of the DLOM is the time to a liquidity event. In other words, how long will the owner of the shares have to hold onto them before they can be openly exchanged and sold? Most DLOM studies conclude a discount in the 25%-35% range for a two-year holding period. Discounts greater than this are reasonable if the time to a liquidity event is many years in the future.</p>\n<p>In the case of a backsolve (see #7), your DLOM will actually likely be lower than these ranges because the 409A valuation is benchmarking to a preferred instrument, which implicitly incorporates a certain lack of marketability into the pricing from the VC investor.</p>\n<h2><div class=\"toc-mobile-wrapper\"><h4>TABLE OF CONTENTS</h4><ul class=\"toc-list\"></ul></div><div data-toc-header=\"409A Valuation Myths\" id=\"section--4\"></div>409A Valuation Myths</h2>\n<p>Companies want to keep the common FMV low since it makes stock options seem more lucrative to employees and recruits. However, pursuing the lowest possible value at all costs can create serious consequences for your company and your employees. While the 409A valuation framework has become well established, some myths from the early days have persisted. In this section, we bust the four most common.</p>\n<h3>10. MYTH: Your common stock is worth 20% of the last round\u00e2\u0080\u0099s price</h3>\n<p>Gone are the days where a private company, working with its Board and outside counsel, could just use a rule of thumb to set common stock FMV at 10-20% of the most recent preferred round (yes, this really was how option strike prices used to be set at private companies!). Only in rare instances is a privately-held company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s common stock FMV legitimately 10-20% of the value of its preferred stock \u00e2\u0080\u0093 even with early, seed-stage companies.</p>\n<p>So, if anybody tells you your 409A is too high and should be \u00e2\u0080\u009cX% of the preferred,\u00e2\u0080\u009d they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re giving outdated advice. \u201cPercent of preferred is one of the most misunderstood \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and anachronistic \u00e2\u0080\u0093 metrics in the venture world,\u00e2\u0080\u009d notes Bob Chung, Director of Valuations at Carta. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe ratio is highly dependent on a given company\u2019s ability to negotiate favorable financing terms at a specific point in time. It can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be applied as a benchmark across a range of disparate companies.\u201d</p>\n<p>The truth is without running through an actual 409A valuation analysis, no one can know what the FMV of your common stock should be off the top of their head. There is no \u00e2\u0080\u009crule of thumb,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and every company is unique. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen valuations come back that sounded way too low, but it turned out they were reasonable because of the economic rights of the preference stack; I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve also seen FMVs that seemed way too high but were in actuality reasonable because of the significant progress the companies had made since their last 409As or because the methodology justifiably changed.</p>\n<span class=\"bctt-click-to-tweet\"><span class=\"bctt-ctt-text\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https://a16z.com/2020/02/13/16-things-about-the-409a-valuation/&amp;text=Without%20running%20through%20an%20actual%20409A%20valuation%20analysis%2C%20no%20one%20can%20know%20what%20the%20FMV%20of%20your%20common%20stock%20should%20be%20off%20the%20top%20of%20their%20head.%20There%20is%20no%20%E2%80%9Crule%20of%20thumb%2C%E2%80%9D%20and%20every%20company%20is%20unique.&amp;via=a16z&amp;related=a16z\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Without running through an actual 409A valuation analysis, no one can know what the FMV of your common stock should be off the top of their head.

MYTH: You can use a different forecast for your 409A valuation than your Board forecast</h3>\n<p>In the early days of 409A, this was a commonly-used tactic, but companies can no longer get away with it. While it may be tempting not to give your 409A valuation provider the true company forecast \u00e2\u0080\u0093 the one that you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re reporting to your Board \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and instead provide an artificially low set of projections to try to keep the value of your common stock low, the company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s forecast is one of the very first places someone will look to make sure the assumptions used in the analysis were reasonable. They will verify this was the version you were using to run the business; if it isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t, it will cause issues with your auditors (where applicable), and invalidate the 409A safe harbor, opening up huge risk to your employees.</p>\n<h3>12. MYTH: Do whatever it takes to get the lowest strike price</h3>\n<p>When it comes to strike price, small changes you manage to squeeze out of your 409A aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t going to make much of a difference to your employees\u00e2\u0080\u0099 take-home when there is a meaningful liquidity event. Let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s walk through the math on how the economic difference of pennies, dimes, or even dollars in strike prices won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have a significant material impact in the big picture of a liquidity event:</p>\n<p>As an example, let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s say an employee is given an initial grant of 100,000 options with a strike price of $0.35. Six years later, the company has an exit where the common shares are worth $50. Here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s this employee\u00e2\u0080\u0099s take home before taxes on that grant:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 80px\">($50 \u2013 $0.35) x 100,000 shares = <strong>$4,965,000</strong></p>\n<p>Now let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s say instead of $0.35, the strike price at the time of that employee\u00e2\u0080\u0099s grant had been $2.00. Then the take home before taxes would have been:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 80px\">($50 \u2013 $2.00) x 100,000 shares = <strong>$4,800,000</strong></p>\n<p><em>While the difference between the two strike prices of $0.35 and $2.00 looks significant (471%!), the actual financial outcome had a 3% difference.</em></p>\n<p>The key takeaway here is it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s important to keep things in perspective. Your common stock is going to appreciate in a way that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s reflective of the progress you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re making in building your company. Keep in mind: doing things that could invalidate your 409A safe harbor will open up your employees to significant taxes and penalties (see #15), dramatically reducing what they net from their options. If you feel the FMV is starting to \u00e2\u0080\u009csound expensive\u00e2\u0080\u009d from an ability-to-recruit-new-hires perspective, you can consider doing a stock split to get the strike price back down to a level you feel makes you sound more competitive.</p>\n<h3>13. MYTH: The strike price must be exactly the same as the 409A FMV</h3>\n<p>While you can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t choose an option strike price that is lower than the 409A valuation\u00e2\u0080\u0099s calculated FMV, you can set a strike price that is higher. The relevant regulatory and tax authorities are generally only concerned when the strike price was set at a level that was lower than the 409A valuation supported: For the IRS, it would mean employees had actually received discounted (\u00e2\u0080\u009cin the money\u00e2\u0080\u009d) stock options that then would have been taxable at the time of grant; and for the SEC, it would indicate that the company was understating its stock compensation expense to artificially improve its profitability.</p>\n<p>Setting the strike price higher than the 409A FMV can be useful in situations where the company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s enterprise value (see #7) has declined since the last 409A valuation. Such cases include when the prior 409A valuation is now significantly ahead of the company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s current traction (and the new 409A is therefore lower), or in a down-round situation. In these instances, the company can opt to keep the strike price \u00e2\u0080\u009cflat\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u0093 the same value as the prior 409A valuation \u00e2\u0080\u0093 to preserve employee morale. However, be realistic when making this kind of decision: what will likely happen between now and the next 409A; are you confident this is just a one-time blip in the company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s progress?</p>\n<h2><div class=\"toc-mobile-wrapper\"><h4>TABLE OF CONTENTS</h4><ul class=\"toc-list\"></ul></div><div data-toc-header=\"Good intentions, unintended consequences\" id=\"section--5\"></div>Good intentions, unintended consequences</h2>\n<p>In this section, we cover a few of the consequences of having an overly-aggressive 409A valuation. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYour 409A follows you around, and shows up in secondary transactions, tax issues, audit review, and of course, in the pre-IPO phase\u00e2\u0080\u009d notes Steve Liu, Head of Shareworks Valuation Services, \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s got to be right.\u00e2\u0080\u009d</p>\n<h3>14. Hurts employee morale</h3>\n<p>For early stage companies where an audit is more than two years away, the reality is there is less risk having an aggressive 409A valuation compared to larger, more established companies. Having said that, there will come a time when that window closes, as it inevitably does when you build a successful company. When it happens, you will face a significant step-up to your FMV as you come off a too-aggressive 409A and are effectively forced into a clean valuation.</p>\n<p>Now you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve inadvertently created a situation where one group of employees has very low-priced options and another group \u00e2\u0080\u0093 some who will have started only days or weeks after the early group \u00e2\u0080\u0093 with significantly higher priced ones, even though the business hasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t changed that materially. Now you have a world of \u00e2\u0080\u009chaves\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009chave-nots,\u00e2\u0080\u009d because inevitably, employees will talk to each other and resentment can then build up. This issue will stay with you, coming up every time you have compensation discussions involving those employees.</p>\n<h3>15. Creates significant tax burdens for your employees</h3>\n<p>The financial consequences for 409A non-compliance can be severe to your employees. If the IRS were to get involved and determined your 409A valuation didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t fall under safe harbor, all of the stock you granted to your employees under that FMV \u00e2\u0080\u0093 not just the current taxable year, but any prior year \u00e2\u0080\u0093 become included as part of their gross income (including interest owed) all at once in that year. The IRS can also levy up to a 20% penalty on stock options that vested prior to that tax year.</p>\n<p>As an example, let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s say you granted an employee 100,000 options that vest over four years at a strike price of $0.25. Two years after you granted these options, the IRS reviews your 409A valuation from that grant and determines the $0.25 FMV didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t fall under safe harbor because of flawed methodologies, and the common stock actually had been worth $1.00.</p>\n<p>Here is the math on what your employee would owe in that tax year at the federal level (we won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t walk through federal interest owed or what would be owed at the state level):</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 80px\">Federal income tax rate = 37% (assume highest bracket for a single filer in 2020)<br/>\nFederal 409A penalty = 20%</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 80px\">Option grant strike price = $0.25<br/>\nCurrent FMV in year 2 = $5.00<br/>\n<span style=\"text-decoration: underline\"># of common shares vested at 2 years = 50,000</span><br/>\n<strong>Taxable income = $232,500</strong> (50,000 shares x [$5-$0.25])</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 80px\">Federal income tax = $86,025 (37% x $232,500)<br/>\n<span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Federal 409A penalty = $23,750 (20% x 25,000* shares x [$5 \u2013 $0.25])</span><br/>\n<strong>Total federal taxes &amp; penalties* = $109,775 </strong></p>\n<h6 style=\"padding-left: 80px\">*penalty only owed on prior year\u00e2\u0080\u0099s vested options, not current tax year</h6>\n<p>This $109,775 is actual cash the employee will have to pay to the IRS, and it doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t matter that the employee didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t exercise their options to sell a single share, or that there was nobody to whom they could sell those shares even if they did exercise. Because the stock options were not granted at FMV in the eyes of the IRS, but rather 75% below FMV (at the $0.25 strike price), the option grants do not fall under safe harbor. As the options vests, this is considered taxable income \u00e2\u0080\u0093 with a penalty tacked on for the taxes that weren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t paid on the prior year\u00e2\u0080\u0099s vested options. All over $0.75!</p>\n<p>On top of this, there will be taxes owed in any future year where that option grant continues to vest. If FMV continues to increase, then the tax liability also increases:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 80px\">Option grant strike price = $0.25<br/>\nCurrent FMV in Year 3 = <strong>$6.50</strong><br/>\n<span style=\"text-decoration: underline\"># of common shares vested at Year 3 = 25,000</span><br/>\nTaxable income = $156,250 (25,000 shares x [$6.50-$0.25])</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 80px\"><strong>Federal income tax in year 3 = $57,813</strong> (37% x $156,250)</p>\n<p>Again, it doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t matter whether this employee actually sold a single share or not! The IRS will expect them to pay $58K in income tax on that year\u00e2\u0080\u0099s vested options. (And this will happen for one more year since the options vest over 4 years.)</p>\n<p>Worse, the tax issues won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t end with the federal government. State and local income taxes will also come into play. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe states have focused on equity compensation in recent years. California, in particular, reviews equity compensation arrangements to determine whether an employer and employee have reported correctly and routinely imposes penalties on top of a tax rate that can climb as high as 13.3%,\u00e2\u0080\u009d notes Eric Anderson, Managing Director of the SF Bay Area State and Local Tax practice at Andersen Tax.</p>\n<p>Moral of the story: Always retain a qualified and independent 409A valuation firm, and make sure the valuation work is defensible so that safe harbor applies and option grants remain tax-free events for your employees.</p>\n<h3>16. Negatively affects an acquisition or IPO</h3>\n<p>During M&amp;A due diligence, the acquirer will review your 409A valuations. Generally speaking, bad 409A practices tend to look sloppy and won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t do you any favors to setting the tone for negotiations. If the buyer determines they aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t comfortable with the 409A valuation(s), they can alter the terms of the transaction so that any financial burden associated with the mispriced options are not their responsibility, they can require that you indemnify them for the risk, or they can require that you pay (or force your employees to pay) any associated penalties and taxes related to the affected option grants.</p>\n<p>From an IPO standpoint, the SEC will review option issuances for the 12-18 month period preceding an IPO. If there is a significant difference in the option strike price and the proposed IPO price, the SEC could determine the options were granted below their actual fair market value (and thus, \u00e2\u0080\u009cin the money\u00e2\u0080\u009d). This will generally require the company to take an accounting change related to cheap stock, which is not great to have to disclose to potential investors as it can be construed as a reflection of the quality of management.</p>\n<p>Andy Barton, Partner at Goodwin &amp; Procter LLP points out, \u00e2\u0080\u009c409A valuations are open to challenge by a variety of actors, including not only the IRS, but also potential buyers in a transaction, or the SEC in an IPO. It is imperative to get it right.\u00e2\u0080\u009d</p>\n<h2><div class=\"toc-mobile-wrapper\"><h4>TABLE OF CONTENTS</h4><ul class=\"toc-list\"></ul></div><div data-toc-header=\"The Bottom Line\" id=\"section--6\"></div>The Bottom Line</h2>\n<span class=\"bctt-click-to-tweet\"><span class=\"bctt-ctt-text\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https://a16z.com/2020/02/13/16-things-about-the-409a-valuation/&amp;text=A%20better%20approach%20to%20your%20409A%20valuation%3A%20view%20them%20as%20part%20of%20the%20narrative%20of%20your%20company%E2%80%99s%20progress.%20Done%20well%2C%20you%20can%20tell%20a%20story%20that%20informs%20and%20inspires%20employees%20and%20candidates.&amp;via=a16z&amp;related=a16z\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">A better approach to your 409A valuation: view them as part of the narrative of your company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s progress.

While you should absolutely work with your 409A provider to optimize the valuation, don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t resort to using questionable valuation methods and/or assumptions \u00e2\u0080\u0093 doing this can have serious, unintended consequences, as we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve outlined above.</p>\n<p>A 409A valuation isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t an exercise in \u00e2\u0080\u009cmaximizing the minimum,\u00e2\u0080\u009d where the goal is to have the common stock appreciate as little as possible from the prior FMV. If that were the case, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re making the claim that between your last 409A valuation and now, the company made almost no progress at all \u00e2\u0080\u0093 meaning you created very little value.

Ideally, the FMV of the common stock will have a nice smooth, upward progression that mirrors the growing success of your company.

In a down market, when capital is more expensive and valuations are down, these structured deals\u00e2\u0080\u0094that is, a deal with non-standard clauses\u00e2\u0080\u0094become more common, as founders look for ways to avoid raising money at a lower price per share than your previous round (i.e., a down round).\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Our aim in this piece is to arm startups with an understanding of different contract terms used to increase headline valuation, how investors think of and use those terms, and the impacts, especially on equity dilution, to consider before signing on the dotted line.</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><div class=\"toc-mobile-wrapper\"><h4>TABLE OF CONTENTS</h4><ul class=\"toc-list\"></ul></div><div data-toc-header=\"The equity-to-debt spectrum\" id=\"section--1\"></div>The equity-to-debt spectrum\u00c2\u00a0</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In practice, different options and terms can be combined, and in later sections, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll dig into both specific terms used to sweeten equity proposals and a side-by-side comparison of common scenarios.

When someone gets a \u00e2\u0080\u009cclean term sheet,\u00e2\u0080\u009d that usually means standard preferred equity with a 1x non-participating liquidation preference (more on liquidation preferences in the next section). On the other end of the spectrum, non-convertible debt caps the lender\u00e2\u0080\u0099s return at the interest rate, so might make for a \u00e2\u0080\u009cclean term sheet,\u00e2\u0080\u009d albeit a more complicated balance sheet. (You can find our guide to raising debt and debt terms </span><a href=\"https://a16z.com/2022/04/15/16-things-to-know-about-raising-debt-for-startups/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">here</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">).\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In the middle, structured preferred equity and convertible debt are often considered \u00e2\u0080\u009cdirty term sheets\u00e2\u0080\u009d because they add deal terms that sweeten the deal for investors, such as features to add </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">incremental potential upside or increase the guaranteed minimum return. </span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><div data-toc-header=\"Economic deal sweeteners\" id=\"section--2\"></div>Economic deal sweeteners</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Structured clauses and deals, despite being called \u00e2\u0080\u009cdirty,\u00e2\u0080\u009d aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t innately good or bad, and we aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t here to tell founders what the right terms are for their business. However, we do want to make sure founders understand the tradeoffs that come with a structured deal. With any term sheet\u00e2\u0080\u0094up or down\u00e2\u0080\u0094a founder is focused on the valuation. If one raises the same amount of capital on the same terms, but at a higher price, the financing is less dilutive to existing shareholders.\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">While structure can happen in up rounds, it is more commonly seen as a means of minimizing decreased valuation from the prior round. For example, a founder might have the choice of accepting a \u00e2\u0080\u009cclean\u00e2\u0080\u009d term sheet at a 40% discount or accepting a structured flat round. Most employees, customers, and partners will not know about the structure and a flat round sounds better than a 40% down round.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In reality, the best funding option comes from striking the right balance of </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">valuation</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> and dilution to align incentives among your investors and board, the founders, and the employees. Here, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll dig into some of the most common sweeteners that are used to increase headline valuation and </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">how they impact dilution and stakeholder alignment.\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Warrants\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0</span></h3>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">What it is: </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Warrants are one of the most common ways investors and founders structure contracts to turn a down round into a flat round. Warrants (or options) give the investor the right, but not the obligation, to purchase a predetermined number of shares of the company at a predetermined exercise price before the expiration date, which can range from a few months to a decade. That exercise price can be as little as one cent (or even fractions of a cent), also known as a penny warrant, or issued at the standing valuation.\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Why it matters: </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The exercise price is the central lever used to increase valuation, but the lower the warrant exercise price, the more potential dilution. Penny warrants, in particular, are essentially free incremental shares in the company so they bring down the \u201creal\u201d price of the round. </span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Secondary financing\u00c2\u00a0</span></h3>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">What it is: </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In a secondary financing, investors purchase stock from existing shareholders. This is in contrast to a primary financing, in which a company issues new stock in exchange for cash on the company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s balance sheet. Investors may purchase preferred shares in a primary financing at a high valuation while also purchasing secondary equity (often common stock without protections) from a prior investor at a lower price.</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Why it matters:</span></i> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Purchasing discounted secondary stock lowers the average purchase price for the investor. Typically, lower priced secondary is blended with primary to get a lower effective price for investors. Since the new primary equity is issued at a higher price and existing stock is sold at a lower price, this allows for a higher headline valuation with minimal dilution. However, secondary comes with fewer protections for the investor, and depending on who the seller is, can be interpreted as a negative signal. For example, if the founders are selling shares in a secondary transaction, they are reducing their own ownership at a discount to the headline valuation price.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">At times, investor demand may be relatively fixed such that any invested capital toward secondary sales reduces the amount available for primary. As such, for companies with downstream capital needs, they may prefer to prioritize primary over secondary.</span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Conversion price\u00c2\u00a0</span></h3>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">What it is: </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The price at which convertible debt can be turned into equity. Essentially, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the strike price for a debt lender. The conversion price can be a valuation cap, a discount to the next preferred financing round, or benchmarked to an IPO (e.g., debt converts at 20% discount to the IPO price).\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Why it matters: </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Convertible debt allows lenders to participate in the upside of the company while getting paid back (with interest), like debt in a less optimistic scenario. Founders typically want to set as high as possible a conversion price, similar to pricing a round, to minimize dilution. </span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Anti-dilution clauses</span></h3>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">What it is: </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Anti-dilution clauses, such as an IPO ratchet, protect investors from pricing the current round too high by granting more shares to investors if a future round or IPO is priced below a predetermined level.</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Why it matters:</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> For investors, anti-dilution provides more safety around a higher headline valuation. If the valuation later declines, particularly at IPO, they will be given more shares to make up some or all of the difference. If valuation declines, this translates to (an often significant) dilution for founders and other unprotected shareholders. While nearly all equity financings have price-based anti-dilution protection, \u00e2\u0080\u009cratchet\u00e2\u0080\u009d protection\u00e2\u0080\u0094where investors are made entirely whole from a future down round or IPO\u00e2\u0080\u0094are usually only found in structured deals. </span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Liquidation preference\u00c2\u00a0</span></h3>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">What it is: </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Liquidation preference refers to who gets paid back first, and how much, in the event of liquidation. Seniority ranks the order in which investors are paid back, with the most senior paid first\u00e2\u0080\u0094making them the most secure.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Multiples refer to what multiple of the original investment must be paid before less senior investors are paid. Typically, investors take a 1x liquidation multiple, so they get their money back before common equity shareholders get anything. However, a liquidation preference multiple can be greater or less than 1x.\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Liquidation preference can also be participating or non-participating. A non-participating liquidation preference means the investor gets the </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">greater of</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> the underlying liquidation preference or the value of such investor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pro rata ownership of the company. A participating liquidation preference means the investor gets the liquidation preference </span><b>and</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> the value of its pro rata ownership of the company, if any, after its liquidation preference is paid.\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">For example, assume a company was worth $1B and had an investor with a 1x participating liquidity preference who invested $100M and owns 20% of the shares. At sale, the investor would first receive $100M, leaving $900M. Then, they would receive 20% of the $900M according to their pro-rata ownership\u00e2\u0080\u0094getting $280M total, or 28%, of the total equity value.</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Why it matters: </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Liquidation preference is most relevant in a downside scenario. If the company exits at a higher price per share than the per share price an investor paid for preferred equity multiplied by the liquidation preference multiple, such preferred equity converts into common stock and, if non-participating, has no effect on the proceeds received by the holders of common stock. If, however, the company exits at a lower price per share, or in the unfortunate case of bankruptcy, investors get their investment back (or a portion thereof) before common shareholders receive any proceeds.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The majority of \u00e2\u0080\u009cclean\u00e2\u0080\u009d financings stipulate that all preferred investors are paid their liquidation preference on an equal basis (often called </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">pari passu</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> in term sheets and legal documents). Some structured investors push to have a senior liquidation preference, where the latest investors get paid their liquidation preference before existing investors.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">A 1x liquidation preference is standard for investors and protects invested capital by guaranteeing a return for investors and preventing startup teams from doing a dividend on the investor\u2019s cash on a pro rata ownership basis and running away with the investor money. However, in a down market when investors become more risk averse, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s more common to see liquidation preferences at higher multiples (e.g., 1.25\u00e2\u0080\u00932.0x, but could be higher).\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">While less common than adjusting the liquidation multiple, a participating liquidation preference is a significant economic sweetener, though it does reduce the distribution pool in the cap table for everyone else and is perceived to be \u00e2\u0080\u009cdouble dipping.\u00e2\u0080\u009d For that reason, companies often negotiate the participation feature to fall away after a certain return threshold is met (e.g,. 3.0x).</span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">PIK Interest\u00c2\u00a0</span></h3>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">What it is:</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> Rather than paying cash on a quarterly or annual basis, payment-in-kind, or \u00e2\u0080\u009cPIK\u00e2\u0080\u009d, compounds the original investment of the security with all structure and protections included.\u00c2\u00a0 These PIK payments can appear as dividends in structured equity deals, and as accruing interest in structured debt deals.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">For example, a $100M note with a 10% cash interest rate would pay out $10M in interest and still have $100M in principal after one year, while a 10% PIK interest rate would pay out nothing but have $110M in principal after one year. After another year, the cash interest note would pay $10M and still have $100M in principal, but the PIK interest note would again pay nothing and have $121M in principal (i.e., 10% of $110M=$11M and $110M+$11M=$121M). Note that all features and terms of the original note would be preserved with the PIK. For example, if there was a 1.5x liquidity preference, that would apply to all $121M of the principal, not just the original $100M.</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Why it matters:</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> PIK interest means no cash outflows for the duration of the time the accruing equity or debt is outstanding, but leads to a greater number of shares, a structured equity deal, or more principal at the end of the term. This can mean more dilution or a larger cash outlay on repayment. Often, these PIK payments are compounding, so investors receive additional dividends or interest on dividends or interest paid, which can add up quite significantly.</span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Governance provisions</span></h3>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">What it is: </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Structured transactions often carry stronger governance provisions and added blocks for investors. One of the most common governance provisions is around IPO auto-conversion, which refers to shares automatically converting into common stock at IPO. Auto-conversion is standard practice, but investors can gain incremental optionality (and leverage at the time of an IPO) by requiring a majority vote for auto-convert or leaving the possibility for a vote to block auto-conversion at IPO. Other governance provisions can add protective provisions that determine whether new investors have strong voting rights on the board composition, veto rights, etc.\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Why it matters:</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> Optionality is valuable to investors, especially since many protections in structured deals (liquidity preferences, minimum returns, the ability to get repaid as debt) expire at IPO.</span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Recapitalizations/cram downs/pay-to-plays</span></h3>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">What it is:</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> If times are very tough, investors can push for a term sheet with \u00e2\u0080\u009crecap,\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009ccram down,\u00e2\u0080\u009d or \u00e2\u0080\u009cpay-to-play\u00e2\u0080\u009d provisions. While structured in different ways, most involve converting the preferred shares of all existing investors into common shares at a 1:1 ratio or lower (5:1, 10:1 etc.). This wipes out all of the liquidation preferences and other rights of the existing investors, and in the case of lower conversation ratios, strongly dilutes all existing investors. The new investors then typically come in with preferred shares that are senior to those of earlier investors.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><br/>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><br/>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">A \u00e2\u0080\u009cpay-to-play\u00e2\u0080\u009d or \u00e2\u0080\u009cpull-up\u00e2\u0080\u009d provision may also be included, where existing investors who participate in the new round at their pro rata allocation (or other standard) then get their common shares re-converted to preferred shares. These re-converted shares sometimes restore the existing investors\u00e2\u0080\u0099 rights in full, but sometimes the re-converted shares\u00c2\u00a0 are less senior to the new investors\u00e2\u0080\u0099 shares and carry a &lt;1x liquidation preference.</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Why it matters:</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> The \u00e2\u0080\u009crecap\u00e2\u0080\u009d or \u00e2\u0080\u009ccram down\u00e2\u0080\u009d term sheets typically happen when a company is relatively distressed. The structure allows the new investors to contribute new money that is protected, since they are now the most senior preferred, and allow the new investors to invest new money into a company with a lower liquidation preference stack (which can grow to be quite significant in later stage companies that have raised a lot of money). The \u00e2\u0080\u009cpay-to-play\u00e2\u0080\u009d term sheets can have these same effects, but have the added effect of incentivizing the company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s existing investors to continue participating in the company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fundraising.</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><div data-toc-header=\"Hypothetical scenarios/term sheets\" id=\"section--3\"></div>Hypothetical scenarios/term sheets</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Now that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve laid out some of the most common structured terms, let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s look at how this plays out in different fundraising scenarios. To set up our scenarios, let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s imagine that a company last raised at a $5B post-money valuation.

For our first scenario, the company will do a clean down round with standard preferred equity, raising $200M at a $3B pre-money valuation, or 40% below its previous valuation. The new investors now own ~6.3% of the company (not including any anti-dilution adjustments to the existing investors\u00e2\u0080\u0099 holdings that may be triggered). If the company had done a flat round at $5B pre-money, the new investors would own ~3.8% of the company.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">As investors, we evaluate a down round much the same as we do an up round: we start with a blank sheet of paper rather than anchoring to a previous valuation. We assess the company\u00e2\u0080\u0094its performance, business model, market opportunity, management team\u00e2\u0080\u0094to determine the valuation we are willing to pay. Sometimes that is higher than the last round value, sometimes lower, but we try to not over-index on the last round and form our view on valuation based on our current assessment of the company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s future potential cash flow generation.</span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Scenario-1-scaled.jpeg?ssl=1\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-315131\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"1088\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Scenario-1-scaled.jpeg?resize=2560%2C1088&amp;ssl=1\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Scenario-1-scaled.jpeg?w=2560&amp;ssl=1 2560w, https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Scenario-1-scaled.jpeg?resize=300%2C128&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Scenario-1-scaled.jpeg?resize=1024%2C435&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Scenario-1-scaled.jpeg?resize=768%2C326&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Scenario-1-scaled.jpeg?resize=1536%2C653&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Scenario-1-scaled.jpeg?resize=2048%2C870&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Scenario-1-scaled.jpeg?resize=125%2C53&amp;ssl=1 125w, https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Scenario-1-scaled.jpeg?resize=590%2C251&amp;ssl=1 590w, https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Scenario-1-scaled.jpeg?resize=1120%2C476&amp;ssl=1 1120w\" width=\"2560\"/></a></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Pros: </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The down round keeps the cap table clean, which is particularly valuable for incentive alignment.\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Cons: </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">A down round will dilute existing equity more than a clean flat or up round, and can send a negative signal to the market.

Will prospective employees want to join? Will customers and partners worry about our ability to provide our service? Will we have trouble raising rounds in the future if we take a down round now? These are legitimate concerns, and in a down round, you need to be aware of and prepared to address them.\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">However, the reality is that down rounds are far more common than most people realize, even in good times. In fact, companies that have raised down rounds include Facebook, Square, DoorDash, and Box. From 2006 to 2020, flat and down rounds were 28% of venture financings. At the end of the Global Financial Crisis in 2009, the median VC financing was a flat round, and more than one third were down rounds.</span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Graphic-DownRounds-1-1-scaled.jpg?ssl=1\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-315091\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"1508\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Graphic-DownRounds-1-1-scaled.jpg?resize=2560%2C1508&amp;ssl=1\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Graphic-DownRounds-1-1-scaled.jpg?w=2560&amp;ssl=1 2560w, https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Graphic-DownRounds-1-1-scaled.jpg?resize=300%2C177&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Graphic-DownRounds-1-1-scaled.jpg?resize=1024%2C603&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Graphic-DownRounds-1-1-scaled.jpg?resize=768%2C452&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Graphic-DownRounds-1-1-scaled.jpg?resize=1536%2C905&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Graphic-DownRounds-1-1-scaled.jpg?resize=2048%2C1206&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Graphic-DownRounds-1-1-scaled.jpg?resize=125%2C74&amp;ssl=1 125w, https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Graphic-DownRounds-1-1-scaled.jpg?resize=560%2C330&amp;ssl=1 560w, https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Graphic-DownRounds-1-1-scaled.jpg?resize=1070%2C630&amp;ssl=1 1070w\" width=\"2560\"/></a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">When a company nears IPO, has more investors and employees with equity, and a clean cap table becomes more important, a down round may be the best option. </span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Scenario 2: structured preferred equity with 1.5x senior liquidity preference</span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">For our second scenario, the company raises $200M at a valuation of $5B</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, or flat with the previous valuation.

However, it introduces complexity into the cap table and can be very dilutive if the company does not do as well as expected.</span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Scenario 4: $200M debt with a 5-year maturity and 8% cash interest</span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">For our final scenario, the company takes on $200M of venture debt with an 8% cash interest rate and 5-year maturity. The company immediately pays ~$5M in fees at close (directly deducted), then must make a payment of $4M every quarter ($16M every year) for the next five years. At the end of the fifth year, the company must repay $200M. The company also has to conform to lender covenants, and submit detailed financial and other compliance reporting to the lender.</span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Scenario-4-scaled.jpg?ssl=1\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-315034\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"1088\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Scenario-4-scaled.jpg?resize=2560%2C1088&amp;ssl=1\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Scenario-4-scaled.jpg?w=2560&amp;ssl=1 2560w, https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Scenario-4-scaled.jpg?resize=300%2C128&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Scenario-4-scaled.jpg?resize=1024%2C435&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Scenario-4-scaled.jpg?resize=768%2C326&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Scenario-4-scaled.jpg?resize=1536%2C653&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Scenario-4-scaled.jpg?resize=2048%2C870&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Scenario-4-scaled.jpg?resize=125%2C53&amp;ssl=1 125w, https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Scenario-4-scaled.jpg?resize=590%2C251&amp;ssl=1 590w, https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Scenario-4-scaled.jpg?resize=1120%2C476&amp;ssl=1 1120w\" width=\"2560\"/></a></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Pros: </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Vanilla venture debt is cheap, simple, and will keep the cap table clean.</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Cons: </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Venture debt availability depends on the health of the company. In a downturn, venture debt may become less available, if at all. There are likely more covenants and reporting required as part of taking on venture debt, which is issued by lenders with a lower risk tolerance. Flexibility is also likely very low and the company is bound to pay cash interest on a regular basis, which will impact cash flow, as well as a bullet principal payment at the end of 5 years.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Venture debt is senior to equity so in a downside scenario, first capital distributions would go to the debtholders ahead of any equity holders. </span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Bottom Line: </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Venture debt is a simple, low-cost way to continue funding the business. As the senior most piece of the capital structure, these debtholders are the first paid out. When available, venture debt is a good option for companies when the business model is understood and the company could flip to profitability based on their existing cash balance. However, venture debt will often come with stringent reporting requirements and covenants, as well as strict interest and principal payment schedules.\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">For founders, job #1 is to get to the next round of funding or cash flow positive, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a job that gets tougher when the market turns. But if you can strike the right balance of dilution, valuation, and flexibility in your fundraising strategy, it can be a strategic advantage that doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t just allow you to survive lean times, but puts you in a strong position to capture market share and grow when the market comes back.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Note: returns and ownership are approximate, and calculated with simplifying assumptions such as no incremental dilution from further fundraising or effect from anti-dilution provisions. IPO valuations assume no debt and thus represent market capitalization, except in the venture debt scenario where $200M of debt is assumed.</span></i></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">If you\u2019re curious to learn more about financing for startups, we recommend picking up Scott Kupor\u2019s </span></i><a href=\"https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/607128/secrets-of-sand-hill-road-by-scott-kupor-foreword-by-eric-ries/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The Secrets of Sand Hill Road: Venture Capital and How to Get It</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">.</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u00c2\u00a0</span></i></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">***</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The views expressed here are those of the individual AH Capital Management, L.L.C.

So how do you prepare? Understand the unique value-add of your product, define the customer who would benefit most from that value-add, then assess if you can service their needs.</span></i></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">When I joined Segment as CRO, the company was selling to a wide customer base, from early stage startups to some of the biggest enterprises in the world. As much as 20% of our ARR was coming from enterprise use cases that weren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t the best fit for our product, we were spending too much on sales and marketing chasing too broad an upmarket segment, and we had a glut of one-off feature requests that stymied engineering innovation. This problem wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t limited to Segment, though. In fact, the single biggest mistake I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen companies make when moving upmarket is mistaking initial enterprise interest for product-market fit when, in actuality, your product usually needs to be much more robust to address the complexities of a large enterprise company. I learned a lot of lessons working with the Segment team to turn things around in two years\u00e2\u0080\u0094lessons that I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m excited to share here.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">So how do you prepare to move upmarket? Get crisp on your product value framework, use that framework to define your enterprise ideal customer profile (ICP), then align your product roadmap and sales motion to make sure you can service that ICP\u00e2\u0080\u0099s needs.</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><div class=\"toc-mobile-wrapper\"><h4>TABLE OF CONTENTS</h4><ul class=\"toc-list\"></ul></div><div data-toc-header=\"Understand your product value framework\" id=\"section--1\"></div>Understand your product value framework</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Just because you have product-market fit for startups, SMBs, or mid-market customers does </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">not </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">mean you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll automatically find product-market fit in the enterprise space\u00e2\u0080\u0094even if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve already closed enterprise deals. At Segment, one of the ways we knew we needed to revisit our product-market fit was when we were giving away services to enterprise customers in order to cover up gaps in our product. Implementing Segment was relatively straightforward for an early-stage startup, but much more difficult for enterprise customers. We often gave away free consulting to enterprise customers to help us close deals. Customers, however, wound up using this as free support, and we ended up carving this consulting out of our ACV. More importantly, this didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t lead to customer success\u00e2\u0080\u0094so we had higher levels of churn in the enterprise space.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Before you sign enterprise deals and even begin to consider enterprise product-market fit, you should clearly outline your product\u00e2\u0080\u0099s value framework. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">At Segment, we partnered with an external consultant to define this in two steps:\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Interviewing both our own customers and target prospects to better understand their current and future pain points, and</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Combining this discovery with market research data to help us answer key questions about our customers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 pain points and how Segment solved them</span></li>\n</ol>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">We emerged from the process with a crisp product value framework: </span><b>we were the only customer data platform (CDP) built on data that you could trust\u00e2\u0080\u0094data that was clean, verified, de-duplicated, and continuously updated.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s critical to align the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">entire organization </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">on this product value framework because it lays the foundation for understanding your enterprise customer. At Segment, it was especially important to have full backing from both the CEO and the board for this initiative. With this support, we could bring everyone from the C-suite together to participate in this process, which created a shared language that the entire company could use, both internally and externally, to discuss how Segment uniquely addressed our most influential customers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 needs.\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><div data-toc-header=\"Define your enterprise ICP\" id=\"section--2\"></div>Define your enterprise ICP</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Once you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve aligned on your product\u00e2\u0080\u0099s value proposition, you need to figure out the highest-value customer (or ICP), buyer, and use cases for your product. From those understandings, you can then estimate the total addressable market (TAM) for your product\u00e2\u0080\u0094and then make a strategic decision about which ICP you want to pursue. At Segment, we enlisted a consultant to conduct market research and extensive customer and prospect interviews, and we learned the following about our ICP, buyer, and TAM:</span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">ICP</span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Your ICP represents the customer who will benefit the most from the unique, differentiated value-add of your product. Identify your highest-value customers by asking:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">What are my target customers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 specific pain points?</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">What are their use cases, and how do those pain points map to them?</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">How do we address those pain points in a way that is uniquely and defensibly differentiated from the competition?</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">How do you improve the bottom line for this customer: through increased revenue, cost savings, risk mitigation, or accelerated time to market?\u00c2\u00a0</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Through this research, we found that our ICP was larger enterprises that were B2C, multi-product, multi-brand, multi-subsidiary, and most importantly, data-literate. We also discovered that Segment\u00e2\u0080\u0099s enterprise ICP differed in four key ways from our initial startup ICP:\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><b>Need for professional services</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">: because of the complexities of the enterprise segment\u00e2\u0080\u0094companies that included massive numbers of brands and subsidiaries that had each collected data in a different way\u00e2\u0080\u0094our enterprise customers needed a professional services function to help them align around a new understanding of collecting and managing data with Segment.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><b>Need for platform extensibility</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">: our customers often needed to extend the functionality of our platform by asking our engineering team to build one-off connections for our customers, which taxed our engineering productivity and resulted in unsupportable custom builds. We needed to enable our professional services team to partner with our customers and give them the ability to build out their own integrations in a standard, supportable way.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><b>Business ownership</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">: our enterprise ICP was a business owner (often from digital transformation, growth, or marketing) interested in a product package that was distinct from our existing offering.\u00c2\u00a0</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><b>Process emphasis</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">: our enterprise ICP cared a lot more about reliability, security, and data privacy and less about the speed and agility that we had been accustomed to building for.\u00c2\u00a0</span></li>\n</ul>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Buyer and use cases</span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Your buyer persona represents the actual person who would be buying your product. Pay attention to their desired use cases for a product: this will help you understand how the unique value of your product will help your buyer solve their most pressing problems. To define your buyer, ask yourself:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Who owns the ultimate business problem that your product solves?</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Who is the person who can assign a discretionary budget to solve this problem? What is their typical budget?</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">What are their priorities and what capabilities should a product have in order to solve their problems?\u00c2\u00a0</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Could there be other individuals involved in evaluating and deciding whether to buy our product? This was important to consider at Segment because our product was often purchased by a buying unit that included both marketing and data engineering leaders.\u00c2\u00a0</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">How do they buy? What is the process they will use to evaluate how our product fits their decision criteria?</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">What is their expectation in terms of engagement and support?</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">At Segment, our buyer in enterprise shifted from a technical buyer to a CMO\u00e2\u0080\u0094an interesting development I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll circle back to below.</span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">TAM</span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Once you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve nailed down your ICP, buyer, and use cases, you can estimate your TAM. Estimating your TAM means understanding the universe of customers you can serve, the quantified business value you can deliver to that customer, and the amount of budget your buyer is willing to allocate to solve their problem. Ask yourself:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Who are the specific customers that represent the highest value?</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">What do we need from a product, sales, success, services and support perspective to win their dollars and make them successful?</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">You can calculate your TAM by multiplying your target customers * percentage you can win * average spend, then triangulate this result with external market data, internal customer data, and analyst reports.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">At Segment, we found that our long-term TAM in the enterprise was significantly larger than the initial wedge where we found product-market fit with developers in high-growth tech. As I mentioned, our buyer also shifted to a CMO whose expectations for a CDP included journey orchestration, marketing automation, and machine learning. These weren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t features we had in the product and we knew we couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t build them quickly. Moreover, we knew we couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t win those customers unless we identified a strong data leader who could champion Segment\u00e2\u0080\u0099s value proposition to a marketer.\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Pulling all of this work together, we then decided to target a narrower ICP within our TAM: large enterprise companies with forward-thinking data champion buyers who were either decision-makers or could partner with a CMO to shape the decision criteria in favor of what Segment brought to the table.</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><div data-toc-header=\"Map your ICP to your product roadmap and sales motion\" id=\"section--3\"></div>Map your ICP to your product roadmap and sales motion</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Once you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve defined your enterprise ICP, you then need to map their needs onto your product roadmap and sales motion to make sure that you can service them. Even if you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have a solution to every one of their problems on day 1, you should at least understand how your product roadmap and sales motion will iterate to tackle enterprise opportunities one bite at a time. Here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what this looked like at Segment:</span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Product roadmap</span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">When I first joined Segment, Tido Carriero, Segment\u00e2\u0080\u0099s CPO, was fielding dozens of product gap reports from enterprise customers per quarter, often doing north of 100 sales assists throughout a fiscal year. After clarifying our enterprise ICP, Carriero narrowed 27 different engineering priorities down to 3 major themes, which he turned </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">into a product roadmap: </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><b>Platform extensibility</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">: Segment needed to support integrations that were not in our catalog (e.g., a data connection to an internal tool at the enterprise). In order to move away from building one-off connections, we needed to extend the platform so that it could be built by either Segment\u2019s professional services team or the customer directly.\u00c2\u00a0</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><b>Reliability</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">: we had built a lot of new features too quickly and it was clear that one of our newer packages just wasn\u2019t ready for enterprise scale.\u00c2\u00a0</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><b>Data residency:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> with new data privacy laws affecting many countries, our enterprise customers needed to understand how we would handle their data to comply with these new regulations.\u00c2\u00a0</span></li>\n</ul>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Enterprise sales motion</span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Bringing clarity to our product roadmap made for a great selling point to our data-driven, organizationally-complex ICP. We also</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> knew that we needed to revise our sales motion to service our enterprise buyer. Our existing sales motion was originally an inbound machine driven by high-velocity, marketing-qualified leads. These deals converted very quickly: often, our pipeline was created and closed within the quarter, and our buyer was a technical buyer who intuitively understood Segment\u00e2\u0080\u0099s value proposition. After aligning on our enterprise ICP, however, we realized that we needed to build out a go-to-market motion with a different kind of seller: one who was experienced in outbound pipeline generation, who could map out the political map of an organization and find and build data-driven champions, and who could run a sales cycle that could last as long as 9 or 12 months.\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">And because we knew our ICP needed a professional services function in order to get the most out of Segment, we built out this function to engage in presale discussions with our clients to help them be \u00e2\u0080\u009cparticipants in their own rescue\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u0094meaning that we could align defined outcomes and statements of work with our enterprise sales motion. Customers could then be clear about what they could expect the product to do, what our consulting team would do, and what their own role in implementation was.\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><div data-toc-header=\"Hit enterprise product-market fit\" id=\"section--4\"></div>Hit enterprise product-market fit</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Thanks to this crisp alignment around our enterprise customer, we quickly addressed the most important product needs for our ICP. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">1\u00e2\u0080\u00932 years after launching Segment Functions\u00e2\u0080\u0094which enabled platform extensibility\u00e2\u0080\u0094we expanded the Segment integrations catalog from ~300 to ~3,000 integrations in production, many of which were enterprise customers. We buckled down and spent 6 months rebuilding the infrastructure of one of our newer packages, which solved dozens of smaller bugs. And we moved all of Segment\u2019s systems to support multi-region, which delighted not only 100% of our enterprise customers, but also saved an at-risk EMEA business.\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">As a result, Segment\u00e2\u0080\u0099s revenue rose 150% over the course of two years, and our enterprise gross revenue retention (GRR) improved from 63% to 92%\u00e2\u0080\u0094a clear indicator of customer success. This was critical, of course, but one of the most dramatic impacts was the improvement in engineering productivity. No longer drowning in customer escalations and armed with a clear focus of what to build and what not to build, our engineering and product teams were free to advance our product roadmap in ways we previously felt impossible without resorting to acquisitions\u00e2\u0080\u0094which, in turn, gave the team the bandwidth to eventually build the features our original CMO buyer was looking for, expanding our TAM and accelerating our growth.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Moving upmarket isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t easy, but when you take the time to do it right, you can unlock significant revenue. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhen we took a step back and took the time to really understand our enterprise ICP,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says Carriero, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwe immediately found clarity and our aligned go-to-market motions and R&amp;D worked better than anything we had seen before.

We just got our hands on Microsoft\u00e2\u0080\u0099s new web server, Internet Information Server (IIS), and benchmarked against our product. Microsoft\u00e2\u0080\u0099s IIS had every feature that we had, was five times faster and we knew that they were going to give it away for free. This might not sound so bad, but we had just gone public three months earlier with a story to Wall Street that said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cDon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t worry about Microsoft giving away the browser because we will make money selling servers.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Oh snap.</p>\n<p>I immediately went to work trying to move the playing field and pivot the server product line to something that we could sell for money. The late, great Mike Homer and I worked furiously on a set of partnerships and acquisitions that would broaden the product line and surround the web server with enough functionality that we would be able survive the attack.</p>\n<p>As I excitedly reviewed the plan with my engineering counterpart, Bill Turpin, he looked at me as though I was a little kid who had much to learn. Bill was a long-time veteran of battling Microsoft from his time at Borland and understood what I was trying to do, but remained unconvinced. He said: \u00e2\u0080\u009cBen, those silver bullets that you and Mike are looking for are fine and good, but our web server is five times slower. There is no silver bullet that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to fix that. No, we are going to have to use a lot of lead bullets.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Oh snap.</p>\n<p>As a result of Bill\u00e2\u0080\u0099s words, we focused our engineering team on fixing the performance issues while working the other things in the background. We eventually beat Microsoft\u00e2\u0080\u0099s performance and grew the server line to become a $400M business and we would never have done it without those lead bullets.</p>\n<p>I carried that lesson with me for many years. Six years later, when I was CEO of Opsware, our toughest competitor Bladelogic started to consistently beat us in large deals. We were a public company and the losses were all too visible. To make matters worse, we needed to win those deals in order to beat the Wall Street projections, so the company felt tremendous pressure. Many of the smartest people in my company came to me with ideas for avoiding the battle:</p>\n<p>\u00e2\u0080\u009cLet\u00e2\u0080\u0099s build a light-weight version of the product and go down market.\u00e2\u0080\u009d</p>\n<p>\u00e2\u0080\u009cLet\u00e2\u0080\u0099s acquire a company with a simpler architecture.\u00e2\u0080\u009d</p>\n<p>\u00e2\u0080\u009cLet\u00e2\u0080\u0099s focus on service providers.\u00e2\u0080\u009d</p>\n<p>The issue with their ideas was that we weren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t facing a market problem. The customers were buying; they just weren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t buying our product. This was not a time to pivot. So I said the same thing to every one of them: \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere are no silver bullets for this, only lead bullets.\u00e2\u0080\u009d They did not want to hear that, but it made things clear: we had to build a better product. There was no other way out. No window, no hole, no escape hatch, no backdoor. We had to go through the front door and deal with the big, ugly guy blocking it. Lead bullets.</p>\n<p>After nine months of hard work on an extremely rugged product cycle, we regained our product lead and eventually built a company that was worth $1.6B. Without the lead bullets, I suspect we would have ended at about 1/10<sup>th</sup>\u00c2\u00a0that value.</p>\n<p>There may be nothing scarier in business than facing an existential threat. So scary that many in the organization will do anything to avoid it. They will look for any alternative, any way out, any excuse not to live or die in a single battle. I see this often in start up pitches. The conversations go something like this:</p>\n<blockquote><p><em>Entrepreneur:</em>\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe have the best product in the market by far. All the customers love it and prefer it to competitor X.\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br/>\n<em>Me</em>: \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy does competitor X have five times your revenue?\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br/>\n<em>Entrepreneur</em>: \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe are using partners and OEMs, because we can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t build a direct channel like competitor X.\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br/>\n<em>Me</em>: \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy not? If you have the better product, why not knuckle up and go to war?\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br/>\n<em>Entrepreneur</em>: \u00e2\u0080\u009cUmmm.\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br/>\n<em>Me</em>: \u00e2\u0080\u009cStop looking for the silver bullet.\u00e2\u0080\u009d</p></blockquote>\n<p>There comes a time in every company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s life where it must fight for its life. If you find yourself running when you should be fighting, you need to ask yourself: \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf our company isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t good enough to win, then do we need to exist at all?\u00e2\u0080\u009d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The views expressed here are those of the individual AH Capital Management, L.L.C.

Between the emergence of Stripe, Plaid, and other category-defining decacorns; the continued launches of financial services offerings from non-banks like Apple and Walmart; and the general API-ification of the average tech stack, there are many structural tailwinds propelling fintech infrastructure forward.\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">We see this firsthand on the fintech team at a16z. Every week, we have the privilege of meeting dozens of incredibly sharp founders who are tackling everything from domestic adjacencies to existing offerings (e.g., payroll connectivity or health insurance aggregation), to international versions of U.S. success stories (e.g., bank account aggregation or global know your customer (KYC) tools), to novel problem sets entirely (e.g., bridges between web2 and web3).\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">As we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve said time and again, we at a16z believe </span><a href=\"https://future.com/every-company-fintech-company/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">every company will become a fintech company</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. With this in mind, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re laying out four key components that all infrastructure entrepreneurs operating in this space\u00e2\u0080\u0094whether they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re still in the idea maze or already in market\u00e2\u0080\u0094need to consider as they build their companies. We also present three forks in the road where founding teams will need to decide which way to take their business.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><div class=\"toc-mobile-wrapper\"><h4>TABLE OF CONTENTS</h4><ul class=\"toc-list\"></ul></div><div data-toc-header=\"The Must-Haves\" id=\"section--1\"></div>The Must-Haves </span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">There are many approaches to building infrastructure, but we believe these four strategies are vital to ensuring your company has a solid foundation and a path to scale.</span></p>\n<p><b>Mission criticality: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Would your customers be materially disrupted (or even forced to halt operations) if your service went down? Or are you merely a nice-to-have? The answers to these questions directly determine the pricing power, defensibility, and overall stickiness of your product. The deeper you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re embedded\u00e2\u0080\u0094and oftentimes, the stricter your uptime SLAs!\u00e2\u0080\u0094the harder it is to replace you. While certainly not all successful infrastructure businesses will become 100% mission critical, we believe it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s easier to drive higher customer LTV when the core service you provide is absolutely essential to day-to-day operations. Typically, within fintech, this means that your product is a key enabler of either onboarding and account opening/funding (e.g., Alloy, Middesk, Plaid, Sardine, Synapse); underwriting, issuing, and loan origination (e.g., Adyen, Credit Kudos, Experian, FIS, Fiserv, Lithic, Marqeta, Spade, TransUnion, Vesta); or payment acceptance and collection servicing (e.g., Moov, Navient, Nelnet, Shopify, SpotOn, Square, Stripe, Valon). We recognize that many of these companies, such as Stripe, offer services that would place them into multiple categories, but for simplicity\u2019s sake, we have placed companies into the categories they are best known for.</span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Mission-Critical-Infrastructure-Companies-Twitter-Final.png?ssl=1\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-315271\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"512\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Mission-Critical-Infrastructure-Companies-Twitter-Final.png?resize=1024%2C512&amp;ssl=1\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Mission-Critical-Infrastructure-Companies-Twitter-Final.png?resize=1024%2C512&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Mission-Critical-Infrastructure-Companies-Twitter-Final.png?resize=300%2C150&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Mission-Critical-Infrastructure-Companies-Twitter-Final.png?resize=768%2C384&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Mission-Critical-Infrastructure-Companies-Twitter-Final.png?resize=1536%2C768&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i2.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Mission-Critical-Infrastructure-Companies-Twitter-Final.png?resize=2048%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i2.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Mission-Critical-Infrastructure-Companies-Twitter-Final.png?resize=125%2C63&amp;ssl=1 125w, https://i2.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Mission-Critical-Infrastructure-Companies-Twitter-Final.png?resize=720%2C360&amp;ssl=1 720w, https://i2.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Mission-Critical-Infrastructure-Companies-Twitter-Final.png?resize=590%2C295&amp;ssl=1 590w, https://i2.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Mission-Critical-Infrastructure-Companies-Twitter-Final.png?resize=1120%2C560&amp;ssl=1 1120w, https://i2.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Mission-Critical-Infrastructure-Companies-Twitter-Final.png?w=3000&amp;ssl=1 3000w\" width=\"1024\"/></a></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re a fintech infrastructure entrepreneur building outside of these core capabilities, we encourage you to be honest with yourself about where you fall on the mission criticality spectrum, and identify opportunities to make your product irreplaceable. One such opportunity might be to re-think your customer set, as sometimes your company can be mission critical to one set of customers but not to others. For example: while transaction enrichment startups like Spade may have initially assumed their most obvious use case would be with personal financial management and budgeting tools, they quickly realized that the capability being offered\u00e2\u0080\u0094a cleaner and more satisfying UX\u00e2\u0080\u0094was mostly a nice-to-have and not directly linked to the top or bottom line. However, when they began selling to an entirely new category of customers, including BaaS providers and cash flow-based underwriting tools, they realized that what they were offering became absolutely critical, as it unlocked valuable net-new information about a consumer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s spending habits\u00e2\u0080\u0094and therefore their likelihood of repaying debt or committing fraud. Spade continues to sell actively to both customer segments, but the distinction in value proposition between the two is important to note.</span></p>\n<p><b>A narrowly defined initial use case:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> To get from 0 to 1, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s our opinion that solving one discreet pain point significantly better (or cheaper!) than anyone else is superior to building proprietary IP that has many potential use cases, especially if none of them are clear on day one. Plaid did a phenomenal job of this; it set out to facilitate basic account aggregation with broader coverage and offer a better developer experience than what the incumbent solutions had in market. While Plaid could have immediately gone full throttle after </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">all</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> the use cases enabled by better open banking connectivity (e.g., lending, investment aggregation, money movement, etc.), it very deliberately built its core business around account opening and onboarding (the /auth, /identity and /balance endpoints) for neobanks and payments wallets. By serving thousands of customers with this core solution, Plaid quickly and efficiently built a massive proprietary data asset, upon which it could </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">then </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">start to experiment with new solutions to attract new customer personas and drive higher existing customer LTV. By solving one distinct pain point better than the competition could, Plaid established trust with its customers, which naturally opened up expansion opportunities to broaden its surface area. Had its initial product been built to accommodate too many use cases too early, Plaid might have\u00c2\u00a0 been challenged by muddier value propositions, a lack of focus, disjointed sales cycles, and a more challenged execution (disclosure: Marc is a proud Plaid alum!).</span></p>\n<p><b>Plaid Link Flow: </b></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Plaid-Screens-Inline-Graphic.png?ssl=1\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"size-large wp-image-314807 aligncenter\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"552\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Plaid-Screens-Inline-Graphic.png?resize=1024%2C552&amp;ssl=1\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Plaid-Screens-Inline-Graphic.png?resize=1024%2C552&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Plaid-Screens-Inline-Graphic.png?resize=300%2C162&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Plaid-Screens-Inline-Graphic.png?resize=768%2C414&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Plaid-Screens-Inline-Graphic.png?resize=1536%2C828&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Plaid-Screens-Inline-Graphic.png?resize=2048%2C1104&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i0.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Plaid-Screens-Inline-Graphic.png?resize=125%2C67&amp;ssl=1 125w, https://i0.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Plaid-Screens-Inline-Graphic.png?resize=590%2C318&amp;ssl=1 590w, https://i0.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Plaid-Screens-Inline-Graphic.png?resize=1120%2C604&amp;ssl=1 1120w, https://i0.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Plaid-Screens-Inline-Graphic.png?w=3000&amp;ssl=1 3000w\" width=\"1024\"/></a></p>\n<p><b>Old Competitor Flow:</b></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/DAGBank-Inline-Graphic-Final.png?ssl=1\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"size-large wp-image-314808 aligncenter\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"560\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/DAGBank-Inline-Graphic-Final.png?resize=1024%2C560&amp;ssl=1\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/DAGBank-Inline-Graphic-Final.png?resize=1024%2C560&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/DAGBank-Inline-Graphic-Final.png?resize=300%2C164&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/DAGBank-Inline-Graphic-Final.png?resize=768%2C420&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/DAGBank-Inline-Graphic-Final.png?resize=1536%2C839&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/DAGBank-Inline-Graphic-Final.png?resize=2048%2C1119&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/DAGBank-Inline-Graphic-Final.png?resize=125%2C68&amp;ssl=1 125w, https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/DAGBank-Inline-Graphic-Final.png?resize=590%2C322&amp;ssl=1 590w, https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/DAGBank-Inline-Graphic-Final.png?resize=1120%2C612&amp;ssl=1 1120w, https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/DAGBank-Inline-Graphic-Final.png?w=3000&amp;ssl=1 3000w\" width=\"1024\"/></a></p>\n<p><b>Neutrality across customers:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re doing your job well, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll likely have many tough decisions to make with respect to deepening your relationship with anchor tenants. Sebastian Kanovich, CEO of the global payments company dLocal, discusses this dilemma very eloquently on the </span><a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/episode/2bTleGZCCn1XgINsbYWebv\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">February 24 episode</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> of the Founders Field Guide podcast with Patrick O\u00e2\u0080\u0099Shaughnessy. In the early days of dLocal, many merchants wanted to advertise their product to dLocal\u00e2\u0080\u0099s user base in exchange for direct payment or a larger contract. While it was surely a tempting offer (especially for a startup that had managed to secure massive customers like Uber and Nike early in its journey), the offer would have likely precluded dLocal from going on to serve other important enterprises (Lyft or Adidas, for example) that competed with these early customers. This neutrality becomes especially important when your business is vying for the new crop of </span><a href=\"https://a16z.com/2022/07/20/the-company-of-the-future-is-default-global/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">default-global companies</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> we at a16z are so excited about. With many new companies looking to compete internationally from day one, surface area for conflicts of interest is only becoming broader. With this in mind, we think it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s important to remain neutral; as a platform and infrastructure provider, you will need to treat all your customers as equally as possible. The moment you break your company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s branding principles, pricing bands, or product design policies to bend over backwards for a big logo is the moment you begin to jeopardize the rest of your customer relationships. Despite NDAs and confidentiality provisions, customers </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">always </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">talk to one another\u00e2\u0080\u0094especially when it comes to price!</span></p>\n<p><b>Consumption-based pricing:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> We recently wrote an entire piece </span><a href=\"https://a16z.com/2022/06/24/in-defense-of-pay-as-you-go/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">in defense of pay-as-you-go pricing</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. To summarize: license-based businesses tend to yield steadier growth and more predictable revenue (every SaaS investor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s dream), while usage-based businesses are more susceptible to market peaks and troughs, and therefore, commonly thought to be riskier. However, while the latter may not be as reliable for true annual </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">recurring</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> revenue, it can result in more revenue and better customer retention over time (especially when paired with thoughtful minimum commitments in master service agreements (MSAs)). Another advantage to usage-based pricing is it aligns cost and value, resulting in zero friction for increased real-time adoption of your product.. Whereas procuring additional SaaS licenses or a new all-you-can-eat deal requires a customer to go through an additional negotiation and/or contractual amendment, consuming more APIs (reflecting end-user growth and demand) can happen with no involvement from a sales team or account manager. Common examples of pay-as-you-go models include SpotOn, Stripe, and Square charging a percentage fee of the payment volume that they process, or E*Trade and Interactive Brokers charging a flat fee for each options contract traded on their respective platforms.</span></p>\n<h3><div class=\"toc-mobile-wrapper\"><h4>TABLE OF CONTENTS</h4><ul class=\"toc-list\"></ul></div><div data-toc-header=\"The Forks in the Road\" id=\"section--2\"></div>The Forks in the Road</h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">After you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve ensured your company is cooking with the right main ingredients, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll need to consider which flavors will round out the dish. Any of the options presented below can result in a Michelin-star meal \u00e2\u0080\u0093 it just comes down to style and preference.</span></p>\n<p><b>Should you target developer-first or business-first buyers? </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In our experience, the developer-first motion\u00e2\u0080\u0094bottoms-up customer acquisition, self-serve onboarding, community engagement\u00e2\u0080\u0094tends to call for a product that provides clean, workable data as opposed to pre-configured modules or applications wrapping the data. Developers typically want to build their own analytics and UX as their \u00e2\u0080\u009csecret sauce,\u00e2\u0080\u009d whereas business-oriented buyers often want something more fully baked to address their immediate need in a more plug-and-play fashion. The latter buyer persona also typically requests myriads of customizations baked into the product, whereas developers are happy to start tinkering with the product as-is and build their own customizations down the line. Each approach has its pros and cons.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Consider here the difference in approach of Persona vs. Socure, two companies operating in the KYC space. For the ambitious developer seeking to build a fully customizable identity verification experience as part of their company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s onboarding flow, Persona markets\u00c2\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u009cbuilding block\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009cmix and match\u00e2\u0080\u009d capabilities all over its homepage (see image below), while highlighting \u00e2\u0080\u009cTry it now\u00e2\u0080\u009d as the main call to action and providing a \u00e2\u0080\u009cDevelopers\u00e2\u0080\u009d hub with links to API documentation and a status dashboard. Socure, on the other hand, runs a more business-oriented go-to-market approach, in which the product is often referred to as a \u00e2\u0080\u009cplatform\u00e2\u0080\u009d and the main call to action is always to \u00e2\u0080\u009cRequest a demo &amp; pricing,\u00e2\u0080\u009d aka, talk to sales.\u00c2\u00a0 \u00c2\u00a0 \u00c2\u00a0 </span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Persona-Socure-Screenshot-CTAs-Inline-Graphic-Final.png?ssl=1\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"size-large wp-image-314809 aligncenter\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"818\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Persona-Socure-Screenshot-CTAs-Inline-Graphic-Final.png?resize=1024%2C818&amp;ssl=1\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Persona-Socure-Screenshot-CTAs-Inline-Graphic-Final.png?resize=1024%2C818&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Persona-Socure-Screenshot-CTAs-Inline-Graphic-Final.png?resize=300%2C240&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Persona-Socure-Screenshot-CTAs-Inline-Graphic-Final.png?resize=768%2C613&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Persona-Socure-Screenshot-CTAs-Inline-Graphic-Final.png?resize=1536%2C1226&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Persona-Socure-Screenshot-CTAs-Inline-Graphic-Final.png?resize=2048%2C1635&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Persona-Socure-Screenshot-CTAs-Inline-Graphic-Final.png?resize=125%2C100&amp;ssl=1 125w, https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Persona-Socure-Screenshot-CTAs-Inline-Graphic-Final.png?resize=413%2C330&amp;ssl=1 413w, https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Persona-Socure-Screenshot-CTAs-Inline-Graphic-Final.png?resize=789%2C630&amp;ssl=1 789w, https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Persona-Socure-Screenshot-CTAs-Inline-Graphic-Final.png?w=3000&amp;ssl=1 3000w\" width=\"1024\"/></a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u00c2\u00a0It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s important to note that developer-first vs. business-first refers to the persona (no pun intended) of the typical buyer within an organization, and not the size or type of the organization itself. If you continue perusing the Persona and Socure websites, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll notice that both companies have successfully sold to customers of all shapes and sizes; Persona has clearly architected its brand around developers, yet boasts many large-enterprise customers like Square, Toast, and Carvana on its homepage. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s easy to assume that startups, mirroring the developer community, prefer to buy core infrastructure building blocks they can then shape into a product themselves, and that enterprises prefer buying more fully baked, off-the-shelf products, but the reality is that purchasing depends largely on which team within an organization is pushing hardest for the product. We would argue that big businesses can be built for either audience, and in fact, over time, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll likely have to cater to both. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just a matter of deciding where to start and how to initially position your brand.</span></p>\n<p><b>Should you optimize for speed or scale?</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> Is the primary utility of your product offering customers a fast, standing start, or is it a foundation upon which they can build for years to come? Will your <a href=\"https://a16z.com/2022/09/14/a-framework-for-finding-a-design-partner/\">precious first customers and early design partners</a> choose to build this capability in house once they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve grown headcount and secured more bandwidth, or will they prefer to abstract it away to you in perpetuity? We think about this as \u00e2\u0080\u009cgraduation risk,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and more often than not tend to favor businesses that entrench themselves as a permanent solution rather than a V1 or stop-gap measure.\u00c2\u00a0</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Having said that, there are of course many startups who can facilitate both speed and scale. It ultimately just comes down to price and complexity.\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><b>Should you offer a consumer-facing brand or a white-label experience? </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In a venture ecosystem where the promise or achievement of \u00e2\u0080\u009cnetwork effects\u00e2\u0080\u009d is often the golden ticket to funding, it may be tempting to slowly but surely disintermediate parts of your customers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 business in an attempt to build a multisided network. Doing so often requires infrastructure companies to transition from white-labeled to branded experiences, since consumers likely didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know they were interacting with your product or service in the first place. Barring very unique circumstances, we caution against this\u00e2\u0080\u0094competing with your customers and imposing your brand into their user experience is often a leading cause for churn (or at a minimum, for scanning the market for a more pliable alternative). If, however, making your brand more prominently known could attract more end users to your business customers, this approach may actually make sense. Look no further than Plaid (again) for another example. While Plaid originally started as more of a white-label experience, over time it created a very deliberate consumer-facing brand that was architected around privacy, trust, and security. This was so that consumers would feel more comfortable linking their bank accounts to third-party apps and services when they saw the Plaid logo. In short, both approaches can work here, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s often a delicate balancing act when transitioning from one approach to the other.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">There are many ways to build a fintech infrastructure company, and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re lucky to be working with players of all permutations and combinations. So long as you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re working towards a clearly defined, mission critical use case while aligning value with cost in an impartial manner, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have plenty of room to iterate on the details.</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">***</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The views expressed here are those of the individual AH Capital Management, L.L.C.

Our scientists will hopefully invent therapies and a vaccine, but then we may not have the manufacturing factories required to scale their production. And even then, we\u2019ll see if we can deploy therapies or a vaccine fast enough to matter \u2014 it took scientists 5 years to get regulatory testing approval for the new Ebola vaccine after that scourge\u2019s 2014 outbreak, at the cost of many lives.</p>\n<p>In the U.S., we don\u2019t even have the ability to get federal bailout money to the people and businesses that need it. Tens of millions of laid off workers and their families, and many millions of small businesses, are in serious trouble *right now*, and we have no direct method to transfer them money without potentially disastrous delays. A government that collects money from all its citizens and businesses each year has never built a system to distribute money to us when it\u2019s needed most.</p>\n<p>Why do we not have these things? Medical equipment and financial conduits involve no rocket science whatsoever. At least therapies and vaccines are hard! Making masks and transferring money are not hard. We could have these things but we chose not to \u2014 specifically we chose not to have the mechanisms, the factories, the systems to make these things. We chose not to *build*.</p>\n<p>You don\u2019t just see this smug complacency, this satisfaction with the status quo and the unwillingness to build, in the pandemic, or in healthcare generally. You see it throughout Western life, and specifically throughout American life.</p>\n<p>You see it in housing and the physical footprint of our cities. We can\u2019t build nearly enough housing in our cities with surging economic potential \u2014 which results in crazily skyrocketing housing prices in places like San Francisco, making it nearly impossible for regular people to move in and take the jobs of the future. We also can\u2019t build the cities themselves anymore. When the producers of HBO\u2019s \u201cWestworld\u201d wanted to portray the American city of the future, they didn\u2019t film in Seattle or Los Angeles or Austin \u2014 they went to Singapore. We should have gleaming skyscrapers and spectacular living environments in all our best cities at levels way beyond what we have now; where are they?</p>\n<p>You see it in education. We have top-end universities, yes, but with the capacity to teach only a microscopic percentage of the 4 million new 18 year olds in the U.S. each year, or the 120 million new 18 year olds in the world each year. Why not educate every 18 year old? Isn\u2019t that the most important thing we can possibly do? Why not build a far larger number of universities, or scale the ones we have way up? The last major innovation in K-12 education was Montessori, which traces back to the 1960s; we\u2019ve been doing education research that\u2019s never reached practical deployment for 50 years since; why not build a lot more great K-12 schools using everything we now know? We know one-to-one tutoring can reliably increase education outcomes by two standard deviations (the Bloom two-sigma effect); we have the internet; why haven\u2019t we built systems to match every young learner with an older tutor to dramatically improve student success?</p>\n<p>You see it in manufacturing. Contrary to conventional wisdom, American manufacturing output is higher than ever, but why has so much manufacturing been offshored to places with cheaper manual labor? We know how to build highly automated factories. We know the enormous number of higher paying jobs we would create to design and build and operate those factories. We know \u2014 and we\u2019re experiencing right now! \u2014 the strategic problem of relying on offshore manufacturing of key goods. Why aren\u2019t we building Elon Musk\u2019s \u201calien dreadnoughts\u201d \u2014 giant, gleaming, state of the art factories producing every conceivable kind of product, at the highest possible quality and lowest possible cost \u2014 all throughout our country?</p>\n<p>You see it in transportation. Where are the supersonic aircraft? Where are the millions of delivery drones? Where are the high speed trains, the soaring monorails, the hyperloops, and yes, the flying cars?</p>\n<p>Is the problem money? That seems hard to believe when we have the money to wage endless wars in the Middle East and repeatedly bail out incumbent banks, airlines, and carmakers. The federal government just passed a $2 trillion coronavirus rescue package in two weeks! Is the problem capitalism? I\u2019m with Nicholas Stern when he says that capitalism is how we take care of people we don\u2019t know \u2014 all of these fields are highly lucrative already and should be prime stomping grounds for capitalist investment, good both for the investor and the customers who are served. Is the problem technical competence? Clearly not, or we wouldn\u2019t have the homes and skyscrapers, schools and hospitals, cars and trains, computers and smartphones, that we already have.</p>\n<p>The problem is desire. We need to *want* these things. The problem is inertia. We need to want these things more than we want to prevent these things. The problem is regulatory capture. We need to want new companies to build these things, even if incumbents don\u2019t like it, even if only to force the incumbents to build these things. And the problem is will. We need to build these things.</p>\n<p>And we need to separate the imperative to build these things from ideology and politics. Both sides need to contribute to building.</p>\n<p>The right starts out in a more natural, albeit compromised, place. The right is generally pro production, but is too often corrupted by forces that hold back market-based competition and the building of things. The right must fight hard against crony capitalism, regulatory capture, ossified oligopolies, risk-inducing offshoring, and investor-friendly buybacks in lieu of customer-friendly (and, over a longer period of time, even more investor-friendly) innovation.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s time for full-throated, unapologetic, uncompromised political support from the right for aggressive investment in new products, in new industries, in new factories, in new science, in big leaps forward.</p>\n<p>The left starts out with a stronger bias toward the public sector in many of these areas. To which I say, prove the superior model! Demonstrate that the public sector can build better hospitals, better schools, better transportation, better cities, better housing. Stop trying to protect the old, the entrenched, the irrelevant; commit the public sector fully to the future. Milton Friedman once said the great public sector mistake is to judge policies and programs by their intentions rather than their results. Instead of taking that as an insult, take it as a challenge \u2014 build new things and show the results!</p>\n<p>Show that new models of public sector healthcare can be inexpensive and effective \u2014 how about starting with the VA? When the next coronavirus comes along, blow us away! Even private universities like Harvard are lavished with public funding; why can\u2019t 100,000 or 1 million students a year attend Harvard? Why shouldn\u2019t regulators and taxpayers demand that Harvard build? Solve the climate crisis by building \u2014 energy experts say that all carbon-based electrical power generation on the planet could be replaced by a few thousand new zero-emission nuclear reactors, so let\u2019s build those. Maybe we can start with 10 new reactors? Then 100? Then the rest?</p>\n<p>In fact, I think building is how we reboot the American dream. The things we build in huge quantities, like computers and TVs, drop rapidly in price. The things we don\u2019t, like housing, schools, and hospitals, skyrocket in price. What\u2019s the American dream? The opportunity to have a home of your own, and a family you can provide for. We need to break the rapidly escalating price curves for housing, education, and healthcare, to make sure that every American can realize the dream, and the only way to do that is to build.</p>\n<p>Building isn\u2019t easy, or we\u2019d already be doing all this. We need to demand more of our political leaders, of our CEOs, our entrepreneurs, our investors. We need to demand more of our culture, of our society. And we need to demand more from one another. We\u2019re all necessary, and we can all contribute, to building.</p>\n<p>Every step of the way, to everyone around us, we should be asking the question, what are you building? What are you building directly, or helping other people to build, or teaching other people to build, or taking care of people who are building? If the work you\u2019re doing isn\u2019t either leading to something being built or taking care of people directly, we\u2019ve failed you, and we need to get you into a position, an occupation, a career where you can contribute to building. There are always outstanding people in even the most broken systems \u2014 we need to get all the talent we can on the biggest problems we have, and on building the answers to those problems.</p>\n<p>I expect this essay to be the target of criticism. Here\u2019s a modest proposal to my critics. Instead of attacking my ideas of what to build, conceive your own! What do you think we should build? There\u2019s an excellent chance I\u2019ll agree with you.</p>\n<p>Our nation and our civilization were built on production, on building. Our forefathers and foremothers built roads and trains, farms and factories, then the computer, the microchip, the smartphone, and uncounted thousands of other things that we now take for granted, that are all around us, that define our lives and provide for our well-being. There is only one way to honor their legacy and to create the future we want for our own children and grandchildren, and that\u2019s to build.</p>\n<h5>audio version:</h5>\n<iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"200\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://player.simplecast.com/4583ce7b-c6cc-4e7d-803c-31dd7d88da1a?dark=true\" title=\"IT'S TIME TO BUILD\" width=\"100%\"></iframe><ul class=\"bio-lp-subscribe__apps\" data-podcast-src=\"https://a16z.simplecast.com/episodes/its-time-to-build?dark=true\"></ul><script>window.distribImages = {};window.distribChannels = [];window.distribImages[\"Apple Podcasts\"] = \"https://a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/bio-lp_apple-podcasts.png\";window.distribChannels.push(\"Apple Podcasts\");window.distribImages[\"Spotify\"] = \"https://a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/bio-lp_spotify.png\";window.distribChannels.push(\"Spotify\");window.distribImages[\"Stitcher\"] = \"https://a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Stitcher@2x.png\";window.distribChannels.push(\"Stitcher\");</script>\n", "author": "Marc Andreessen"}, "120": {"podcast": "a16z Podcast: Getting Sales Right | Andreessen Horowitz", "url": "https://a16z.com/2015/03/04/a16z-podcast-getting-sales-right/", "contents": "Want more a16z?

But the underlying business model \u2014 the concept of \u201cfree-to-play\u201d, built on top of games-as-a-service \u2014 may have been the real innovation that led us to the global gaming phenomenons we have today.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, observes gaming veteran Kevin Chou \u2014 who\u2019s seen it all when it comes to tech platform shifts and gaming as a longtime gamer, founding CEO of Kabam, and now founder and Executive Chairman of <a href=\"https://forte.io/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Forte</a>\u00c2\u00a0\u2014 there is \u201ca dark side\u201d to free-to-play: Game developers have to balance the gamers who <em>aren\u2019t</em> paying with those who <em>are</em>, and especially those who are paying a helluva lot <em>more</em> (the whales) in order to make money and keep the game going. This balance becomes incredibly challenging over time; it is, quite frankly, a lopsided economy. The players will leave: The incentives between game publishers and players are simply not aligned.</p>\n<p>Yet what if we could re-align those incentives \u2014 really, the economic <em>relationships</em> \u2014 between game publishers/developers; players and guilds and clans; those who create on top of games (like on Roblox and Minecraft); those who trade and otherwise transact both inside and outside games (it\u2019s already happening in secondary markets and gold farms). We could do this in a more balanced way, thanks to blockchain technology and cryptoeconomic business models \u2014 leading to thriving gaming economies with better monetization and deeper engagement, as well as new forms of collaboration, community, and creativity.</p>\n<p>But smart contracts, cryptoeconomies, security, etc. is hard for gamers who just want to focus on designing the best game, so how do we get here? Chou shares his thoughts in this episode of the a16z Podcast with Sonal Chokshi and general partner Chris Dixon. In gaming (and in fact, with other tech trends too), innovation happens when there\u2019s a combination of new devices, new technology platforms, <em>and</em> new delivery mechanisms\u2026 but it\u2019s the <em>business-model</em> innovations, argues Dixon, that tend to create the most startup opportunities.</p>\n<p><strong><em>image: battle scene from Eve Online, a game with an economy (via Forte.io)</em></strong></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><em>The views expressed here are those of the individual AH Capital Management, L.L.C.

In this essay, we argue that a breakthrough is on its way: The first phase of the internet has been about creating marketplaces for goods, but the next phase will be about reinventing the service economy. Startups will build on the lessons and tactics to crack the toughest and largest service industries \u2014 including regulated markets that have withstood digital transformation for decades. In doing this, the lives of 125 million Americans who work in the services-providing industries will join the digital transformation of the economy [1].</p>\n<p>In the past twenty years, we\u2019ve transformed the way people buy goods online, and in the process created Amazon, eBay, JD.com, Alibaba, and other e-commerce giants, accounting for trillions of dollars in market capitalization. The next era will do the same to the $9.7 trillion U.S. consumer service economy [2], through discontinuous innovations in AI and automation, new marketplace paradigms, and overcoming regulatory capture.</p>\n<p>The service economy lags behind: while services make up 69% of national consumer spending, the Bureau of Economic Analysis estimated that just 7% of services were primarily digital, meaning they utilized internet to conduct transactions [3].</p>\n<p>We propose that a new age of service marketplaces will emerge, driven by unlocking more complex services, including services that are regulated. In this essay, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll talk about:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Why services are still primarily offline</li>\n<li>The history of service marketplace paradigms\n<ul>\n<li>The Listings Era</li>\n<li>The Unbundled Craigslist Era</li>\n<li>The \u00e2\u0080\u009cUber for X\u00e2\u0080\u009d Era</li>\n<li>The Managed Marketplace Era</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>The future of service marketplaces\n<ul>\n<li>Regulated services</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Five strategies for unlocking supply in regulated markets</li>\n<li>Future opportunities</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s start by looking at where the service economy is right now and why it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s resisted a full scale transformation by software.</p>\n<h3>Software is eating the service economy, but it\u2019s been slow</h3>\n<p>We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve all had the experience of asking friends for recommendations for a great service provider, whether it be a great childcare provider, doctor, or hair stylist. Why is that? Why aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t we discovering and consuming these services in the same digital way we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve come to expect for goods?</p>\n<p>Despite the rise of services in the overall economy, there are a few reasons why services have lagged behind goods in terms of coming online:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Services are complex and diverse, making it challenging to capture relevant information in an online marketplace</li>\n<li>Success and quality in services is subjective</li>\n<li>Fragmentation \u2014 small service providers lack the tools or time to come online</li>\n<li>Real-world interaction is at the heart of services delivery, which makes it hard to disaggregate parts of a purchase that might be done online</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s unpack each reason below:</p>\n<p>First, on the complexity and diversity of services, services are performed by providers who vary widely, unlike goods which are manufactured to a certain spec. Even the names of services can vary: what one home cleaning service calls a \u00e2\u0080\u009cdeep clean\u00e2\u0080\u009d can be different from another provider\u00e2\u0080\u0099s definition. This lack of standardization makes it difficult for a service marketplace to capture and organize the relevant information.</p>\n<p>Second, services are often complex interactions without a clear yardstick of success or quality. The customer experience of a service is often subjective, making traditional marketplace features like reviews, recommendations, and personalization more difficult to implement. Sometimes just getting the job completed (as in rideshare) is sufficient to earn a 5-star review, whereas other higher-stakes services, like childcare, have complex customer value functions, including safety, friendliness, communicativeness, rapport with child, and other subjective measures of success.</p>\n<p>Third, small service providers often lack the tools or time to come online. In many service industries, providers are small business owners with low margins; contrast this with goods manufacturing where there are economies of scale in production, and thus consolidation into large consumer products companies. As a result of industry fragmentation, service providers often don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have time or budget to devote to key business functions, such as responding to customer requests, promoting and marketing themselves, maintaining a website, and other core functions. While major e-commerce platforms have taken on the role of distribution, merchandising, and fulfilling orders for goods, there are few platforms that service providers can plug into to manage their businesses and reach customers.</p>\n<p>Fourth, real-world interaction is central to services, which can pull other steps of the services funnel into the offline world as well. Many services are produced and consumed simultaneously in real-world interactions, whereas goods entail independent stages of production, distribution, and consumption. The various stages of the goods value chain can be easily unbundled, with e-commerce marketplaces comprising the discovery, transaction, and fulfillment steps. Conversely, since the production and consumption of services usually occur simultaneously offline, the discovery, distribution, and transaction pieces are also often integrated into the offline experience. For instance, since getting a haircut entails going to a salon and having interactions with the providers there, the stages of the value chain that precede and follow that interaction (discovery, booking, and payment) also often get incorporated into the in-person experience.</p>\n<h3><strong>The 4 Eras of Service Marketplaces, and What\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Next</strong></h3>\n<p>There have been 4 major generations of service marketplaces, but coverage of services and providers remains spotty, and many don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t provide end-to-end, seamless consumer experiences. Let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s zoom out and talk through each historical marketplace paradigm, and what we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve learned so far.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-283711 size-large\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"664\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/evolutionofservicesmarketplaces_a16z.jpg?resize=1024%2C664&amp;ssl=1\" width=\"1024\"/></p>\n<h3><strong>1. The Listings Era (1990s)</strong></h3>\n<p>The first iteration of bringing services online involved unmanaged horizontal marketplaces, essentially listing platforms that helped demand search for supply and vice versa. These marketplaces were the digital version of the Yellow Pages, enabling visibility into which service providers existed, but placing the onus on the user to assess providers, contact them, arrange times to meet, and transact. The dynamic here is \u00e2\u0080\u009ccaveat emptor\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u2014 users assume the responsibility of vetting their counterparties and establishing trust, and there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s little in the way of platform standards, protections, or guarantees.</p>\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-283712\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\" id=\"attachment_283712\" style=\"width: 300px\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-283712 size-medium\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"180\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/craigslist-services.png?resize=300%2C180&amp;ssl=1\" width=\"300\"/><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-283712\"><em>Marketplaces from the Craigslist Era are essentially listings sites.</em></figcaption></figure>\n<p>Craigslist\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Services category is the archetypal unmanaged service marketplace. It includes a jumble of house remodeling, painting, carpet cleaners, wedding photographers, and other services. But limited tech functionality means that it feels disorganized and hard to navigate, and there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no way to transact or contact the provider without moving off the platform.</p>\n<h3><strong>2. The Unbundled Craigslist Era (2000s)</strong></h3>\n<p>Companies iterated on the horizontal marketplace model by focusing on a specific sub-vertical, enabling them to offer features tailored to a specific industry.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-283713 size-medium\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"199\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/craigslist-unbundled.png?resize=300%2C199&amp;ssl=1\" width=\"300\"/></p>\n<p>For instance, Care.com carves off the Childcare section of Craigslist, and provides tech value-add in the form of filters, structured information, and other features to improve the customer experience of finding a local caregiver. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a huge leap in terms of user experience over Craigslist\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Childcare section.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-283720 size-medium\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"220\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/care-com.png?resize=300%2C220&amp;ssl=1\" width=\"300\"/></p>\n<p>Angie\u00e2\u0080\u0099s List, a home services site founded in 2005, carves off Craigslist\u00e2\u0080\u0099s household services category. The platform has features including reviews, profiles, certified providers, and an online quote submission process. But the marketplace doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t encompass the entire end-to-end experience: users turn to Angie\u00e2\u0080\u0099s List for discovery, but still need to message or call providers and coordinate offline.</p>\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-283721\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" id=\"attachment_283721\" style=\"width: 300px\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-283721 size-medium\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"227\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/angies-list.png?resize=300%2C227&amp;ssl=1\" width=\"300\"/><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-283721\"><em>Unmanaged vertical marketplaces like Angie\u00e2\u0080\u0099s List go a step beyond Craigslist and take on some value-add services like certifying providers when they meet certain standards, but customers still need to select and contact the service provider, place their trust in the provider rather than the platform, and transact offline.</em></figcaption></figure>\n<p>Like previous listing sites, these platforms in this era try to use the \u201cwisdom of the crowds\u201d to promote trust. These platforms have a network effect in that more reviews means more users and more reviews. But user reviews have their limitations, as every user has a unique value function that they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re judging a service against. Without standardized moderation or curation, and without machine learning to automate this process, customers have the onus of sifting through countless reviews and selecting among thousands of providers.</p>\n<h3><strong>3. The \u2018Uber for X\u2019 Era (2009-2015)</strong></h3>\n<p>In the early 2010s, a wave of on-demand marketplaces for simple services arose, including transportation, food delivery, and valet parking. These marketplaces were enabled by widespread mobile adoption, making it possible to book a service or accept a job with the tap of a button.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft wp-image-283723 size-medium\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"300\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/lugg.png?resize=169%2C300&amp;ssl=1\" width=\"169\"/>Companies like Handy, Lugg, Lyft, Rinse, Uber and many others made it efficient to connect to service providers in real-time. They created a full-stack experience around a particular service, optimizing for liquidity in one category. For these transactions, quality and success were more or less binary \u2014 either the service was fulfilled or it wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t \u2014 making them conducive to an on-demand model.</p>\n<p>These platforms took on various functions to establish an end-to-end, seamless user experience: automatically matching supply and demand, setting prices, handling transactions, and establishing trust through guarantees and protections. They also often commoditized the underlying service provider (for instance, widespread variance on the driver side of rideshare marketplaces is distilled into Uber X, Uber Pool, Uber Black, Uber XL, etc.).</p>\n<p>Unlike the previous generations of marketplaces, in which the provider ultimately owns the end customer relationship, these on-demand marketplaces became thought of as the service provider, e.g. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI ordered food from DoorDash\u00e2\u0080\u009d or \u00e2\u0080\u009cLet\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Uber there,\u00e2\u0080\u009d rather than the underlying person or business that actually rendered the service.</p>\n<p>Over time, many startups in this category failed, and the ones that survived did so by focusing on and nailing a frequent use case, offering compelling value propositions to demand and supply (potentially removing the on-demand component, which wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t valuable for some services), and putting in place incentives and structures to promote liquidity, trust, safety, and reliability.</p>\n<h3><strong>4. The Managed Marketplace Era (Mid-2010s)</strong></h3>\n<p>In the last few years, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen a rise in the number of full-stack or managed marketplaces, or marketplaces that take on additional operational value-add in terms of intermediating the service delivery. While \u00e2\u0080\u009cUber for X\u00e2\u0080\u009d models were well-suited to simple services, managed marketplaces evolved to better tackle services that were more complex, higher priced, and that required greater trust.</p>\n<p>Managed marketplaces take on additional work of actually influencing or managing the service experience, and in doing so, create a step-function improvement in the customer experience. Rather than just enabling customers to discover and build trust with the end provider, these marketplaces take on the work of actually creating trust.</p>\n<p>In the a16z portfolio, Honor is building a managed marketplace for in-home care, and interviews and screens every care professional before they are onboarded and provides new customers with a Care Advisor to design a personalized care plan. Opendoor is a managed marketplace that creates a radically different experience for buying and selling a home. When a customer wants to sell their home, Opendoor actually buys the home, performs maintenance, markets the home, and finds the next buyer. Contrast this with the traditional experience of selling a home, where there is the hassle of repairs, listing, showings, and potentially months of uncertainty.</p>\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-283724\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" id=\"attachment_283724\" style=\"width: 1024px\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-283724 size-large\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"866\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/opendoor.png?resize=1024%2C866&amp;ssl=1\" width=\"1024\"/><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-283724\"><em>Managed marketplaces like Honor and Opendoor take on steps of the value chain that platforms traditionally left to customers or providers, such as vetting supply. Customers place their trust in the platform, rather than the counterparty of the transaction.</em></figcaption></figure>\n<p>To compensate for heavier operational costs, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s common for managed marketplaces to actually dictate pricing for services and charge a higher take rate than less-managed marketplace models.</p>\n<p>Managed marketplaces are a tactic to solve a broader problem around accessing high-quality supply, especially for services that require greater trust and/or entail high transaction value. If we zoom out further, there are many more categories of services that can benefit from managed models and other tactics to unlock supply.</p>\n<h3><strong>What\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Next: The Future of Service Marketplaces (2018-?)</strong></h3>\n<p>We think the next era of service marketplaces have potential to unlock a huge swath of the 125 million service jobs in the US. These marketplaces will tackle the opportunities that have eluded previous eras of service marketplaces, and will bring the most difficult services categories online \u2014 in particular, services that are regulated. Regulated services \u2014 in which suppliers are licensed by a government agency or certified by a professional or industry organization \u2014 include engineering, accounting, teaching, law, and other professions that impact many people\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lives directly to a large degree. In 2015, 26% of employed people had a certification or license [4].</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-283727\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"1024\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/regulated-services_a16z.jpg?resize=905%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" width=\"905\"/><span style=\"font-family:-apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;\">Regulation of services was critical pre-internet, since it served to signify a certain level of skill or knowledge required to perform a job. But digital platforms mitigate the need for licensing by exposing relevant information about providers and by establishing trust through reviews, managed models, guarantees, platform requirements, and other mechanisms. For instance, most of us were taught since childhood never to get into cars with strangers; with Lyft and Uber, consumers are comfortable doing exactly that, millions of times per day, as a direct result of the trust those platforms have built.</span></p>\n<p>Licensing of service professions creates an important standard, but also severely constrains supply. The time and money associated with getting licensed or certified can lock out otherwise qualified suppliers (for instance, some states require a license to braid hair or to be a florist), and often translate into higher fees, long waitlists, and difficulty accessing the service. The criteria involved in getting licensed also do not always map to what consumers actually value, and can hinder the discovery and access of otherwise suitable supply.</p>\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-283725\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" id=\"attachment_283725\" style=\"width: 624px\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-283725 size-full\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"458\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/occupational-licensing.png?resize=624%2C458&amp;ssl=1\" width=\"624\"/><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-283725\"><em>Source: Bureau of Labor Statistics</em></figcaption></figure>\n<h3><strong>Five Strategies to Unlock Industries</strong></h3>\n<p>We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re starting to see a number of startups tackling regulated services industries. As with each wave of previous service marketplaces, these new approaches bring more value-add to unlock the market, with variations in models that are well-suited to different categories.</p>\n<p>The major approaches in unlocking supply in these regulated industries include:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Making discovery of licensed providers easier</li>\n<li>Hiring and managing existing providers to maintain quality</li>\n<li>Expanding or augmenting the licensed supply pool</li>\n<li>Utilizing unlicensed supply</li>\n<li>Automation and AI</li>\n</ol>\n<h5><strong>1) Making discovery of licensed providers easier</strong></h5>\n<p>Some startups are tackling verticals that lack good discovery of licensed providers. Examples include Houzz, which enables users to search for and contact licensed home improvement professionals, and StyleSeat, which helps users find and book beauty appointments with licensed cosmetologists.</p>\n<h5><strong>2) Hiring and managing existing providers to maintain quality</strong></h5>\n<p>Companies can raise the quality of service by hiring and managing providers themselves, and by managing the end-to-end customer experience. Examples are Honor and Trusted, managed marketplaces for elder care and childcare, respectively, which employ caregivers as W-2 employees and provide them with training and tools. In the real estate world, Redfin agents are employees whose compensation is tied to customer satisfaction, unlike most real estate agents who are independent contractors working on commission.</p>\n<h5><strong>3) Expanding or augmenting the licensed supply pool</strong></h5>\n<p>Expanding the licensed supply pool can take the form of leveraging geographic arbitrage to access supply that\u2019s not located near demand. Decorist, Havenly, Laurel &amp; Wolf, and other online interior design companies enable interior designers around the world to provide design services to consumers without physically visiting their homes (yes, in many parts of the US interior design requires a license!). With improvements in real-time video, richer telepresence technologies, and better visualization technologies, more synchronous services are also shifting from being delivered in-person to online. Outschool and Lambda School are examples of de-localizing instruction, enabling teachers and students to participate remotely while preserving real-time interaction.</p>\n<p>Another approach is to help suppliers navigate the certification process. a16z portfolio company Wonderschool makes it easier for individuals to get licensed and operate in-home daycares.</p>\n<p>Lastly, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the approach of augmenting certified providers so they can serve more customers. Fuzzy, an in-home veterinary service, uses AI and vet technicians to augment the productivity of licensed veterinarians; and a16z portfolio company Atrium builds automation and workflow management to provide efficiency gains in the legal industry.</p>\n<h5><strong>4) Utilizing unlicensed supply</strong></h5>\n<p>Some companies utilize unlicensed supply \u2014 notably Lyft, Uber, and other peer-to-peer rideshare networks. Another example is Basis, a managed marketplace for guided conversations with trained but unlicensed specialists to help people with anxiety, depression and other mild to moderate mental health issues.</p>\n<p>In the pet space, Good Dog is a marketplace that brings together responsible pet breeders and consumers looking for a dog. Going beyond existing breeder licensing, which the company felt didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t map to what consumers valued, Good Dog established its own higher set of standards and screening process in conjunction with veterinary and academic experts.</p>\n<h5><strong>5) Automation and AI</strong></h5>\n<p>Other startups automate away the need for a licensed service provider altogether. These include MDacne, which uses computer vision to diagnose and treat acne; and Ike Robotics and other autonomous trucking startups which remove the need for a licensed truck driver.</p>\n<h3><strong>Opportunities for companies addressing regulated services</strong></h3>\n<p>The last twenty years saw the explosion of a number of services coming online, from transportation to food delivery to home services, as well as an evolution of marketplace models from listings to full-stack, managed marketplaces. The next twenty years will be about the harder opportunities that software hasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t yet infiltrated \u2014 those filled with technological, operational, and regulatory hurdles \u2014 where there is room to have massive impact on the quality and convenience of consumers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 everyday lives.</p>\n<p>The services sector represents two-thirds of US consumer spending [5] and employs 80% of the workforce [6]. The companies that reinvent various service categories can improve both consumers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 and professionals\u00e2\u0080\u0099 lives \u2014 by creating more jobs and income, providing more flexible work arrangements, and improving consumer access and lowering cost.</p>\n<p>The companies mentioned in this essay just scratch the surface of regulated industries. You can imagine a marketplace for every service that is regulated, with unique features and attributes designed to optimize for the customer and provider needs for that industry. (A full list of regulated professions in the US can be found <a href=\"https://www.careeronestop.org/toolkit/training/find-licenses.aspx?newsearch=true\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.) We fully expect more Airbnb- and rideshare-sized outcomes in the service economy.</p>\n<p><em>If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re a founder who is looking to take on the challenge of tackling more complex services and bringing them online, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099d love to hear from you.

And with that, comes creating the concept in people\u2019s heads, defining the value, and setting the rules of the game. But when you\u2019re going for a big change, you have to play by the current rules of the game, too.</p>\n<p>And to make things even more complicated, theories about how \u201cIT is dead\u201d \u2014 or the conviction that companies and departments beyond IT will become empowered through software \u2014 are still very much in transition. Somehow we don\u2019t talk about that enough. That means startups need to do everything in two phases: for the now, and for the later and towards two constituencies: both direct lines of businesses <em>and</em> IT. So what does that mean for startups trying to navigate a complex enterprise, including internal debates around build vs. buy? How do you move beyond a few internal champions only? And just how long can a company cash out on founder charisma? In fact, all of these things can give entrepreneurs very confusing, mixed signals about whether or not they have product-market fit yet.

This makes sense, because everybody is just working to build the company. Roles needn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be clearly defined and, in fact, can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be, because everyone does a little bit of everything. In an environment like this there are no politics and nobody is jockeying for position or authority. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s rather nice. So why do all organizations eventually create job titles and what is the proper way to manage them?</p>\n<h2>Why do titles matter?</h2>\n<p>Two important factors drive all companies to eventually create job titles:</p>\n<p><em>1. Employees want them</em>\u00e2\u0080\u0094while you may plan to work at your company forever, at least some of your employees need to plan for life after your company. When your head of sales interviews for her next job, she won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to say that despite the fact that she ran a global sales force with hundreds of employees, her title was \u00e2\u0080\u009cDude.\u00e2\u0080\u009d</p>\n<p><em>2. Eventually, people need to know who is whom</em>\u00e2\u0080\u0094As companies grow, everybody won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know everybody else. Importantly, employees won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know what each other do and whom they should work with to get their jobs done. Job titles provide an excellent short hand for describing roles in the company. In addition, customers and business partners can also make use of this short hand to figure out how to best work with your company.</p>\n<p>Beyond these core reasons, employees will use titles to calibrate their value and compensation against their colleagues. If an employee with a title of Junior Engineer believes that she is a far better programmer than her counterpart with the title Senior Architect, this will indicate to her that she may be under paid and undervalued. Because titles will be used to calculate relative value, they must be managed carefully.</p>\n<h2>The Dangers: The Peter Principle and The Law of Crappy People</h2>\n<p>The basics seem obvious, so why does almost every company eventually make serious mistakes regarding titles. If you have ever worked in a company, you have probably thought to yourself about some overly promoted executive: \u00e2\u0080\u009cHow did he get to be a Vice President? I wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t let him manage a lemonade stand.\u00e2\u0080\u009d</p>\n<p>One challenge is the Peter Principle. Coined by Dr.\u00c2\u00a0<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laurence_J._Peter\">Laurence J. Peter</a>\u00c2\u00a0and\u00c2\u00a0<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raymond_Hull\">Raymond Hull</a>\u00c2\u00a0in their 1969 book<em>, The</em>\u00c2\u00a0<em>Peter Principle</em>\u00c2\u00a0holds that in a\u00c2\u00a0hierarchy, members are promoted so long as they work competently. Sooner or later they are promoted to a position at which they are no longer\u00c2\u00a0competent (their \u201clevel of incompetence\u201d), and there they remain being unable to earn further promotions. As Andy Grove points out in his management classic\u00c2\u00a0<em>High Output Management,\u00c2\u00a0</em>the Peter Principle is unavoidable, because there is no way to know a priori at what level in the hierarchy a manager will be incompetent.</p>\n<p>Another challenge is a phenomenon that I call\u00c2\u00a0<em>The Law of Crappy People</em>. The\u00c2\u00a0<em>Law of Crappy People</em>\u00c2\u00a0states:</p>\n<blockquote><p><em>For any title level in a large organization, the talent on that level will eventually converge to the crappiest person with the title.</em></p></blockquote>\n<p>The rationale behind the law is that the other employees in the company with lower titles will naturally benchmark themselves against the crappiest person at the next level. For example, if Jasper is the worst Vice President in the company, then all of the Directors will benchmark themselves against Jasper and demand promotions as soon as they reach Jasper\u00e2\u0080\u0099s low level of competency.</p>\n<p>As with the Peter Principle, the best that you can do is mitigate the\u00c2\u00a0<em>Law of Crappy People</em>\u00c2\u00a0and that mitigation will be critically important to the quality of your company.</p>\n<h2>Promotion Process</h2>\n<p>The best way to mitigate both the\u00c2\u00a0<em>Peter Principle</em>\u00c2\u00a0and the\u00c2\u00a0<em>Law of</em>\u00c2\u00a0<em>Crappy People\u00c2\u00a0</em>is with a properly constructed and highly disciplined promotion process. Ideally, the promotion process should yield a result similar to the very best Karate Dojos. In top Dojos, in order to achieve the next level (e.g. being promoted from a brown belt to a black belt), you must defeat an opponent in combat at that level. This guarantees that a new black belt is never a worse fighter than the worst current black belt.</p>\n<p>Frustratingly, there is no exact analog to a fistfight in business, so how can we preserve quality without actual combat?</p>\n<p>To begin, start with an extremely crisp definition of not only the responsibilities at each level, but the skill required to perform the duties. When describing the skills, avoid the generic characterizations such as \u00e2\u0080\u009cmust be competent at managing a P&amp;L\u00e2\u0080\u009d or \u00e2\u0080\u009cmust have excellent management skills.\u00e2\u0080\u009d In fact, the best leveling tools get extremely specific and even name names: \u00e2\u0080\u009cshould be a superstar recruiter \u00e2\u0080\u0093 as good as Jenny Rogers.\u00e2\u0080\u009d</p>\n<p>Next, define a formal process for all promotions. One key requirement of the process should be that promotions will be leveled across groups. If you let a manager or a single chain of command determine promotions unilaterally, then it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s possible that e.g. HR will have 5 Vice Presidents and Engineering will have 1. One way to level across groups is to hold a regular promotions counsel that reviews every significant promotion in the company. When a manager wishes to promote an employee, she will submit that employee for review with an explanation of why she believes her employee satisfies the skill criteria required for the level. The committee should then compare the employee to both the level\u00e2\u0080\u0099s skill description and the skills of the other employees at that level to determine whether or not to approve the promotion. In addition to ensuring fairness and level quality, this process will serve to educate your entire management team on the skills and accomplishments of the employees being submitted for promotion.</p>\n<h2>Andreessen vs. Zuckerberg: How Big Should the Titles Be?</h2>\n<p>Should your company make Vice President the top title or should you have Chief Marketing Officers, Chief Revenue Officers, Chief People Officer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s, and Chief Snack Officers? There are two schools of thought regarding this. One characterized by Marc Andreessen and the other by Mark Zuckerberg.</p>\n<p>Andreessen argues that people ask for many things from a company: salary, bonus, stock options, span of control, and titles. Of those, title is by far the cheapest, so it makes sense to give the highest titles possible. The hierarchy should have Presidents, Chiefs, and Senior Executive Vice Presidents. If it makes people feel better, let them feel better. Titles cost nothing. Better yet, when competing for new employees with other companies, using Andreessen\u00e2\u0080\u0099s method you can always outbid the competition in at least one dimension.</p>\n<p>At Facebook, by contrast, Mark Zuckerberg purposely deploys titles that are significantly lower than the industry standard. Senior Vice President\u00e2\u0080\u0099s at other companies must take title haircuts down to Directors or Managers at Facebook. Why does he do this? First, he guarantees that every new employee gets re-leveled as they enter his company. In this way, he avoids accidentally giving new employees higher titles and positions than better performing existing employees. This boosts morale and increases fairness. Secondly, it forces all the managers of Facebook to deeply understand and internalize Facebook\u00e2\u0080\u0099s leveling system which serves the company extremely well in their own promotion and compensation processes.</p>\n<p>He also wants titles to be meaningful and reflect who has influence in the organization. As a company grows quickly, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s important to provide organizational clarity wherever possible and that gets more difficult if there are 50 VPs and 10 Chiefs.</p>\n<p>Next, he finds that business people often carry inflated titles vs. their engineering counterparts. While he recognizes that big titles help them out externally with getting meetings, he still wants to have an organization where the product people and engineers form the cultural core, so he strives to keep this in check as well.</p>\n<p>Does Facebook ever miss out on a new hire due to its low titles? Yes, definitely. But one might argue that they miss out on precisely the employees that they don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want.\u00c2\u00a0In fact, both the hiring and on-boarding processes at Facebook have been carefully designed to encourage the right kind of employees to self-select themselves in and the wrong ones to select themselves out.</p>\n<p>So which method is better, Andreessen\u00e2\u0080\u0099s or Zuckerberg\u00e2\u0080\u0099s? The answer is that it depends. Facebook has so many advantages in recruiting employees that being disciplined about absolute title levels does not significantly impair their ability to attract the very best talent. Your company might not have these advantages, so lofty titles may be a good tactic. In either scenario, you should still run a highly disciplined internal leveling and promotion process.</p>\n<h2>Final Thought</h2>\n<p>You might think that so much time spent on promotions and titles places too much importance and focus on silly formalisms. The opposite is actually true. Without a well-thought out, disciplined process for titles and promotions, your employees will become obsessed with the resulting inequities. If you structure things properly, nobody other than you will spend much time thinking about titles other than Employee of the Month.</p>\n", "author": "Ben Horowitz"}, "130": {"podcast": "Hire the Best CMO: Tips  Insights | a16z", "url": "https://a16z.com/2017/05/26/hiring-cmo-why-what/", "contents": "Want more a16z?

Essentially, CMOs are responsible for \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and held accountable for metrics-wise \u00e2\u0080\u0094 growing the company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s base of users/customers. They are also responsible for increasing revenue and profits; driving engagement and retention; and leading creative, brand, and communications strategies.</p>\n<p>And yet the CMO role can mean very different things in different companies. One of the biggest discrepancies in the role often occurs in consumer- vs. enterprise- focused companies: In consumer businesses, the CMO is often responsible for direct user acquisition through means such as advertising and organic acquisition. In enterprise-focused businesses, the CMO is typically directly responsible for lead generation and sales enablement, and needs to partner tightly with the head of sales to feed a complex and lengthy go-to-market machine.</p>\n<p>CMOs for consumer and enterprise companies are therefore two different types of roles. And while there may some CMOs who have the breadth of skills and experiences to straddle these different types of companies, in my experience it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s quite uncommon to find someone who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s world-class at both. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s why companies that pivot from consumer to enterprise often rebuild their marketing team from top to bottom; it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s almost as if the marketers in consumer and enterprise companies speak different languages.</p>\n<p>But beyond types of customers, CMOs also differ based on the type of marketing that the company needs. Intuit founder Scott Cook observed to me many years ago that there are two types of marketers in the world: artists and scientists:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\">\u00e2\u0080\u009cArtist CMOs\u00e2\u0080\u009d are experts in the many <em>qualitative</em> tasks in marketing, such as positioning the brand, developing marketing materials and storytelling consistent with that positioning, and executing on media campaigns. These CMOs often thrive in companies that spend lots of dollars on media, especially offline media.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\">\u00e2\u0080\u009cScientist CMOs\u00e2\u0080\u009d are experts in many of the <em>quantitative</em> tasks in marketing, in particular at user acquisition strategies, economics, and other optimizations often associated with growth hacking (which some people observe is really marketing by another name, but has a unique connotation in the context of <a href=\"https://www.slideshare.net/a16z/network-effects-59206938\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">network effects</a> businesses). Many scientist CMOs evolved out of the engineering discipline, or out of the direct marketing world \u00e2\u0080\u0094 where the Holy Grail has always been performance marketing and advertising to customers <a href=\"https://a16z.com/2017/02/20/direct-response-2-0-marketing-advertising-retail-o2o/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">based on precise data</a>.</p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Qualities to Look for in a CMO</span></h2>\n<p>First, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s critical that you develop an informed perspective on which type of CMO your business needs <em>before</em> hiring one \u00e2\u0080\u0094 there\u2019s too much risk if you hire one type of CMO and then expect them to thrive in a different role. Most veteran marketers tend to stay in their \u00e2\u0080\u009cswim lanes\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u0094 their prior experiences on their resumes typically stay consistent across their career \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve rarely seen a CMO from their self-designated lane successfully cross over.</p>\n<p>That said, all marketing is a combination of both science <em>and</em> art, so companies typically need some level of both disciplines. Hire the CMO that fits your dominant need, and then have them hire the people on their team that help them fill the gap; for example, a \u00e2\u0080\u009cscientist CMO\u00e2\u0080\u009d hiring a really good VP of Communications/ <a href=\"https://a16z.com/2017/01/25/public-relations-for-startups-founders/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">public relations</a>. But recognize that that these hires will be managed by the particular type of CMO you hire; their mindset will set the priorities for the entire marketing organization including the other hires filling their gaps.</p>\n<p>(FWIW, most consumer tech companies that I work with bias strongly towards scientist CMOs as they bias towards online marketing vs. offline media.)</p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">What Functions do CMOs Perform?</span></h2>\n<p>What are the functions that a marketing organization needs? Note: these don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t necessarily map onto individual hires, and not every marketing team has every function, particularly early on. But as companies mature, they often hire dedicated resources focused on many or most of the below. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve tried to list them here in the order by which new companies add these functions based on my experience:</p>\n<p><strong>User acquisition/lead generation </strong>helps the company grow by the direct acquisition of actual and potential customers. Lead generation involves multiple channels, including search engine marketing (SEM/paid), search engine optimization (SEO/unpaid), social (paid and unpaid), and content advertising. A good chunk of the marketing budget in a consumer company usually resides here. In enterprise companies, the function is just as important, only the users being acquired are <a href=\"https://a16z.com/tag/a-focus-on-developers/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">often developers</a>\u00c2\u00a0and therefore some of <a href=\"https://a16z.com/2016/04/13/selling-to-developers-open-source-business-models/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">the methods</a> are different.</p>\n<p><strong>Marketing communications </strong>aka \u201cMarCom\u201d (and sometimes PR),\u00c2\u00a0defines the company and executive narratives, working with media, through conferences, and other avenues to raise awareness and understanding. Offline and native ad buying also often resides here. Sometimes, the PR/communications function is separated out from the CMO and reports directly into the CEO, but the goal of the function remains essentially the same.</p>\n<p><strong>Retention/engagement </strong>focuses on getting the users you\u2019ve already acquired to <em>stay</em> engaged. Key efforts here typically include messaging (email, in app) to follow up with and incentivize users, as well as re-targeting campaigns.</p>\n<p><strong>Business development </strong>works with other companies to drive user growth, awareness, or monetization. They are the \u00e2\u0080\u009cdeal\u00e2\u0080\u009d team, striving to grow the business through strategic partnerships.</p>\n<p><strong>Brand positioning</strong> develops a very clear definition of what the brand is (and isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t); this includes positioning the brand relative to its competitive set. While the founder typically defines this in the early stages of the company, the marketing function often refines it down the road, updating it based on market traction, customer feedback, desired differentiation, and more.</p>\n<p><strong>Creative</strong> translates the brand positioning into reality through advertisements, collateral, web design, and even the user interface/ user experience of the product.</p>\n<p><strong>Events </strong>help drive growth, not only engaging with customers but also other stakeholders such as developers, providers on a particular platform, and others. Prominent examples of this include Oracle World, Dreamforce by Salesforce, and Airbnb Open.</p>\n<p><strong>Research/analytics </strong>develops informed points of view on non-financial but critical measures of performance, such as: brand awareness, target users, competitive positioning, etc. Best practices here include leveraging both primary and secondary research sources.</p>\n<p>Another core function is <strong>product marketing</strong>. In enterprise/B2B companies, this function tends to be one of the first to be built out, often hand in hand with engineering in technical companies, once the product is feasible. Overall, this function is responsible for developing\u00c2\u00a0product-specific content and messaging (including presentations for customers, demos, and use cases); enabling sales (including capturing case studies); and developing the competitive strategy. Many consumer-facing/B2C companies, however, may build this function later given the viral individual growth a consumer product can often have in the early days; but as those companies begin to diversify their product offerings, they then build out this function (often beyond the CEO, head of product, and head of marketing) to further package features and pricing for various customer segments.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\">*\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 *\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 *</p>\n<p>It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s critical for the CEO to determine which marketing discipline is dominant for their company \u00e2\u0080\u0094 \u00e2\u0080\u009cartist\u00e2\u0080\u009d or \u00e2\u0080\u009cscientist\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u0094 because it will heavily inform their search. But the reality of early stage startups is that they will make a number of other marketing hires before targeting a CMO. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also hard for an early stage company to attract a talented CMO, because the most successful ones are highly coveted and very well paid. On the flip side, many successful CMOs haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t gotten their hands dirty in a while; don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t expect them to be comfortable with things like executing ad buys on Google or Facebook, as they typically have delegated these executional activities to their team in the past. Your early marketing hires should therefore be proficient in the functions above that you think have the <em>most</em> leverage in growing your business.</p>\n<p>And if you are hiring a CMO in a typical enterprise company, know that they will work closely with your head of sales and must be on the same page. If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re hiring in a consumer company, they will likely have significant interaction with the head of product. The executives in this position can and should help you identify the right CMO for your company.</p>\n<p>Cast in the right role, a talented CMO cast has the potential to make a company.

This property creates a number of compelling business benefits, including recurring revenue streams, high (60-80%+) gross margins, and \u00e2\u0080\u0093 in relatively rare cases when network effects or scale effects take hold \u00e2\u0080\u0093 <i>superlinear </i>scaling. Software companies also have the potential to build strong defensive moats because they own the intellectual property (typically the code) generated by their work.</p>\n<p>Service businesses occupy the other end of the spectrum. Each new project requires dedicated headcount and can be sold exactly once. As a result, revenue tends to be non-recurring, gross margins are lower (30-50%), and scaling is linear at best. Defensibility is more challenging \u00e2\u0080\u0093 often based on brand or incumbent account control \u00e2\u0080\u0093 because any IP not owned by the customer is unlikely to have broad applicability.</p>\n<p>AI companies appear, increasingly, to combine elements of both software and services.</p>\n<p>Most AI applications look and feel like normal software. They rely on conventional code to perform tasks like interfacing with users, managing data, or integrating with other systems. The heart of the application, though, is a set of trained data models. These models interpret images, transcribe speech, generate natural language, and perform other complex tasks. Maintaining them can feel, at times, more like a services business \u00e2\u0080\u0093 requiring significant, customer-specific work and input costs beyond typical support and success functions.</p>\n<p>This dynamic impacts AI businesses in a number of important ways.

Today, with the dominance of SaaS, that cost has been pushed back to the vendor. Most software companies pay big AWS or Azure bills every month \u00e2\u0080\u0093 the more demanding the software, the higher the bill.</p>\n<p>AI, it turns out, is pretty demanding:</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><b>Training </b>a single AI model can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars (or <a href=\"https://twitter.com/eturner303/status/1223976313544773634\">more</a>) in <i>compute</i> resources. While it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s tempting to treat this as a one-time cost, retraining is increasingly recognized as an ongoing cost, since the data that feeds AI models tends to change over time (a phenomenon known as \u00e2\u0080\u009cdata drift\u00e2\u0080\u009d).</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><b>Model inference </b>(the process of generating predictions in production) is also more computationally complex than operating traditional software. Executing a long series of matrix multiplications just requires more math than, for example, reading from a database.</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\">AI applications are more likely than traditional software to operate on <b>rich media </b>like images, audio, or video. These types of data consume higher than usual <i>storage </i>resources, are expensive to process, and often suffer from region of interest issues \u00e2\u0080\u0093 an application may need to process a large file to find a small, relevant snippet.</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\">We\u2019ve had AI companies tell us that<b> cloud operations </b>can be more complex and costly than traditional approaches, particularly because there aren\u2019t good tools to scale AI models globally. As a result, some AI companies have to routinely transfer trained models across cloud regions \u00e2\u0080\u0093 racking up big ingress and egress costs \u00e2\u0080\u0093 to improve reliability, latency, and compliance.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Taken together, these forces contribute to the 25% or more of revenue that AI companies often spend on cloud resources. In extreme cases, startups tackling particularly complex tasks have actually found manual data processing cheaper than executing a trained model.</p>\n<p>Help is coming in the form of specialized AI processors that can execute computations more efficiently and optimization techniques, such as model compression and cross-compilation, that reduce the number of computations needed.</p>\n<p>But it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not clear what the shape of the efficiency curve will look like. In many problem domains, exponentially more processing and data are needed to get incrementally more accuracy. This means \u00e2\u0080\u0093 as we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve <a href=\"https://a16z.com/2019/12/17/anyscale/\">noted before</a> \u00e2\u0080\u0093 that model complexity is growing at an incredible rate, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s unlikely processors will be able to keep up. Moore\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Law is not enough. (For example, the compute resources required to train state-of-the-art AI models has grown over 300,000x since 2012, while the transistor count of NVIDIA GPUs has grown only ~4x!) Distributed computing is a compelling solution to this problem, but it primarily addresses speed \u00e2\u0080\u0093 not cost.</p>\n<h2><strong>Gross Margins, Part 2: Many AI applications rely on \u00e2\u0080\u009chumans in the loop\u00e2\u0080\u009d to function at a high level of accuracy\u00c2\u00a0</strong></h2>\n<p>Human-in-the-loop systems take two forms, both of which contribute to lower gross margins for many AI startups.</p>\n<p>First: training most of today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s state-of-the-art AI models involves the manual cleaning and labeling of large datasets. This process is laborious, expensive, and among the biggest barriers to more widespread adoption of AI. Plus, as we discussed above, training doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t end once a model is deployed. To maintain accuracy, new training data needs to be continually captured, labeled, and fed back into the system. Although techniques like drift detection and active learning can reduce the burden, anecdotal data shows that many companies spend up to 10-15% of revenue on this process \u00e2\u0080\u0093 usually not counting core engineering resources \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and suggests ongoing development work exceeds typical bug fixes and feature additions.</p>\n<p>Second: for many tasks, especially those requiring greater cognitive reasoning, humans are often plugged into AI systems in real time. Social media companies, for example, employ thousands of human reviewers to augment AI-based moderation systems. Many autonomous vehicle systems include remote human operators, and most AI-based medical devices interface with physicians as joint decision makers. More and more startups are adopting this approach as the capabilities of modern AI systems are becoming better understood. A number of AI companies that planned to sell pure software products are increasingly bringing a services capability in-house and booking the associated costs.</p>\n<p>The need for human intervention will likely decline as the performance of AI models improves. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s unlikely, though, that humans will be cut out of the loop entirely. Many problems \u00e2\u0080\u0093 like self-driving cars \u00e2\u0080\u0093 are too complex to be fully automated with current-generation AI techniques. Issues of safety, fairness, and trust also demand meaningful human oversight \u00e2\u0080\u0093 a fact likely to be enshrined in AI regulations currently under development in the <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Draft-OMB-Memo-on-Regulation-of-AI-1-7-19.pdf\">US</a>, EU, and elsewhere.</p>\n<span class=\"bctt-click-to-tweet\"><span class=\"bctt-ctt-text\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https://a16z.com/2020/02/16/the-new-business-of-ai-and-how-its-different-from-traditional-software-2/&amp;text=The%20need%20for%20human%20intervention%20will%20likely%20decline%20as%20the%20performance%20of%20AI%20models%20improves.%20It%E2%80%99s%20unlikely%2C%20though%2C%20that%20humans%20will%20be%20cut%20out%20of%20the%20loop%20entirely.&amp;via=a16z&amp;related=a16z\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">The need for human intervention will likely decline as the performance of AI models improves.

The basic function of an AI application is to process a stream of input data and generate relevant predictions. The cost of operating the system, therefore, is a function of the amount of data being processed. Some data points are handled by humans (relatively expensive), while others are processed automatically by AI models (hopefully less expensive). But every input needs to be handled, one way or the other.</p>\n<p>For this reason, the two categories of costs we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve discussed so far \u00e2\u0080\u0093 cloud computing and human support \u00e2\u0080\u0093 are actually linked. Reducing one tends to drive an increase in the other. Both pieces of the equation can be optimized, but neither one is likely to reach the near-zero cost levels associated with SaaS businesses.</p>\n<h2><strong>Scaling AI systems can be rockier than expected, because AI lives in the long tail\u00c2\u00a0</strong></h2>\n<p>For AI companies, knowing when you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve found product-market fit is just a little bit harder than with traditional software. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s deceptively easy to think you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve gotten there \u00e2\u0080\u0093 especially after closing 5-10 great customers \u00e2\u0080\u0093 only to see the backlog for your ML team start to balloon and customer deployment schedules start to stretch out ominously, drawing resources away from new sales.</p>\n<p>The culprit, in many situations, is edge cases. Many AI apps have open-ended interfaces and operate on noisy, unstructured data (like images or natural language). Users often lack intuition around the product or, worse, assume it has human/superhuman capabilities. This means edge cases are everywhere: as much as 40-50% of intended functionality for AI products we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve looked at can reside in the long tail of user intent.</p>\n<p>Put another way, users can \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and will \u00e2\u0080\u0093 enter just about anything into an AI app.</p>\n<span class=\"bctt-click-to-tweet\"><span class=\"bctt-ctt-text\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https://a16z.com/2020/02/16/the-new-business-of-ai-and-how-its-different-from-traditional-software-2/&amp;text=Users%20can%20%E2%80%93%20and%20will%20%E2%80%93%20enter%20just%20about%20anything%20into%20an%20AI%20app.&amp;via=a16z&amp;related=a16z\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Users can \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and will \u00e2\u0080\u0093 enter just about anything into an AI app. </a></span><a class=\"bctt-ctt-btn\" href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https://a16z.com/2020/02/16/the-new-business-of-ai-and-how-its-different-from-traditional-software-2/&amp;text=Users%20can%20%E2%80%93%20and%20will%20%E2%80%93%20enter%20just%20about%20anything%20into%20an%20AI%20app.&amp;via=a16z&amp;related=a16z\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Click To Tweet</a></span>\n<p>Handling this huge state space tends to be an ongoing chore. Since the range of possible input values is so large, each new customer deployment is likely to generate data that has never been seen before. Even customers that appear similar \u00e2\u0080\u0093 two auto manufacturers doing defect detection, for example \u00e2\u0080\u0093 may require substantially different training data, due to something as simple as the placement of video cameras on their assembly lines.</p>\n<p>One founder calls this phenomenon the \u00e2\u0080\u009ctime cost\u00e2\u0080\u009d of AI products. Her company runs a dedicated period of data collection and model fine-tuning at the start of each new customer engagement. This gives them visibility into the distribution of the customer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s data and eliminates some edge cases prior to deployment. But it also entails a cost: the company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s team and financial resources are tied up until model accuracy reaches an acceptable level. The duration of the training period is also generally unknown, since there are typically few options to generate training data faster\u2026 no matter how hard the team works.</p>\n<p>AI startups often end up devoting more time and resources to deploying their products than they expected. Identifying these needs in advance can be difficult since traditional prototyping tools \u00e2\u0080\u0093 like mockups, prototypes, or beta tests \u00e2\u0080\u0093 tend to cover only the most common paths, not the edge cases. Like traditional software, the process is especially time-consuming with the earliest customer cohorts, but unlike traditional software, it doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t necessarily disappear over time.</p>\n<h2><strong>The playbook for defending AI businesses is still being written\u00c2\u00a0</strong></h2>\n<p>Great software companies are built around strong defensive moats. Some of the best moats are strong forces like network effects, high switching costs, and economies of scale.</p>\n<p>All of these factors are possible for AI companies, too.\u00c2\u00a0 The foundation for defensibility is usually formed, though \u00e2\u0080\u0093 especially in the enterprise \u00e2\u0080\u0093 by a technically superior product. Being the first to implement a complex piece of software can yield major brand advantages and periods of near-exclusivity.</p>\n<p>In the AI world, technical differentiation is harder to achieve. New model architectures are being developed mostly in open, academic settings. Reference implementations (pre-trained models) are available from open-source libraries, and model parameters can be optimized automatically. Data is the core of an AI system, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s often owned by customers, in the public domain, or over time becomes a commodity. It also has diminishing value as markets mature and shows relatively weak network effects. In some cases, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve even seen <i>diseconomies</i> of scale associated with the data feeding AI businesses. As models become more mature \u00e2\u0080\u0093 as argued in \u00e2\u0080\u009c<a href=\"https://a16z.com/2019/05/09/data-network-effects-moats/\">The Empty Promise of Data Moats</a>\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u0093 each new edge case becomes more and more costly to address, while delivering value to fewer and fewer relevant customers.</p>\n<p>This does not necessarily mean AI products are less defensible than their pure software counterparts. But the moats for AI companies appear to be shallower than many expected. AI may largely be a pass-through, from a defensibility standpoint, to the underlying product and data.</p>\n<span class=\"bctt-click-to-tweet\"><span class=\"bctt-ctt-text\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https://a16z.com/2020/02/16/the-new-business-of-ai-and-how-its-different-from-traditional-software-2/&amp;text=This%20does%20not%20necessarily%20mean%20AI%20products%20are%20less%20defensible%20than%20their%20pure%20software%20counterparts.%20But%20the%20moats%20for%20AI%20companies%20appear%20to%20be%20shallower%20than%20many%20expected.&amp;via=a16z&amp;related=a16z\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">This does not necessarily mean AI products are less defensible than their pure software counterparts.

In that vein, here are a number of steps founders can take to thrive with new or existing AI applications.</p>\n<p><b>Eliminate </b><b><i>model complexity</i></b><b> as much as possible.</b> We\u2019ve seen a massive difference in COGS between startups that train a unique model per customer versus those that are able to share a single model (or set of models) among all customers. The \u00e2\u0080\u009csingle model\u00e2\u0080\u009d strategy is easier to maintain, faster to roll out to new customers, and supports a simpler, more efficient engineering org. It also tends to reduce data pipeline sprawl and duplicative training runs, which can meaningfully improve cloud infrastructure costs. While there is no silver bullet to reaching this ideal state, one key is to understand as much as possible about your customers \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and their data \u00e2\u0080\u0093 <i>before</i> agreeing to a deal. Sometimes it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s obvious that a new customer will cause a major fork in your ML engineering efforts. Most of the time, the changes are more subtle, involving only a few unique models or some fine-tuning. Making these judgment calls \u00e2\u0080\u0093 trading off long-term economic health versus near-term growth \u00e2\u0080\u0093 is one of the most important jobs facing AI founders.</p>\n<p><b>Choose problem domains carefully \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and often narrowly \u00e2\u0080\u0093 to reduce </b><b><i>data complexity</i></b><b>. </b>Automating human labor is a fundamentally hard thing to do. Many companies are finding that the minimum viable task for AI models is narrower than they expected. Rather than offering general text suggestions, for instance, some teams have found success offering short suggestions in email or job postings. Companies working in the CRM space have found highly valuable niches for AI based just around updating records. There is a large class of problems, like these, that are hard for humans to perform but relatively easy for AI. They tend to involve high-scale, low-complexity tasks, such as moderation, data entry/coding, transcription, etc. Focusing on these areas can minimize the challenge of persistent edge cases \u00e2\u0080\u0093 in other words, they can simplify the data feeding the AI development process.</p>\n<span class=\"bctt-click-to-tweet\"><span class=\"bctt-ctt-text\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https://a16z.com/2020/02/16/the-new-business-of-ai-and-how-its-different-from-traditional-software-2/&amp;text=We%20believe%20the%20key%20to%20long-term%20success%20for%20AI%20companies%20is%20to%20own%20the%20challenges%20and%20combine%20the%20best%20of%20both%20services%20and%20software.&amp;via=a16z&amp;related=a16z\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">We believe the key to long-term success for AI companies is to own the challenges and combine the best of both services and software. </a></span><a class=\"bctt-ctt-btn\" href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https://a16z.com/2020/02/16/the-new-business-of-ai-and-how-its-different-from-traditional-software-2/&amp;text=We%20believe%20the%20key%20to%20long-term%20success%20for%20AI%20companies%20is%20to%20own%20the%20challenges%20and%20combine%20the%20best%20of%20both%20services%20and%20software.&amp;via=a16z&amp;related=a16z\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Click To Tweet</a></span>\n<p><b>Plan for high variable costs. </b>As a founder, you should have a reliable, intuitive mental framework for your business model. The costs discussed in this post are likely to get better \u00e2\u0080\u0093 reduced by some constant \u00e2\u0080\u0093 but it would be a mistake to assume they will disappear completely (or to force that unnaturally). Instead, we suggest building a business model and GTM strategy with lower gross margins in mind. Some good advice from founders: Understand deeply the distribution of data feeding your models. Treat model maintenance and human failover as first-order problems. Track down and measure your real variable costs \u00e2\u0080\u0093 don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t let them hide in R&amp;D. Make conservative unit economic assumptions in your financial models, especially during a fundraise. Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t wait for scale, or outside tech advances, to solve the problem.</p>\n<p><b>Embrace services.</b> There are huge opportunities to meet the market where it stands. That may mean offering a full-stack translation service rather than translation software or running a taxi service rather than selling self-driving cars. Building hybrid businesses is harder than pure software, but this approach can provide deep insight into customer needs and yield fast-growing, market-defining companies. Services can also be a great tool to kickstart a company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s go-to-market engine \u00e2\u0080\u0093 see <a href=\"https://a16z.com/2018/03/12/services-enterprise-software-products-startups/\">this post</a> for more on this \u00e2\u0080\u0093 especially when selling complex and/or brand new technology. The key is pursue one strategy in a committed way, rather than supporting both software and services customers.</p>\n<p><b>Plan for change in the tech stack.</b> Modern AI is still in its infancy. The tools that help practitioners do their jobs in an efficient and standardized way are just now being built. Over the next several years, we expect to see widespread availability of tools to automate model training, make inference more efficient, standardize developer workflows, and monitor and secure AI models in production. Cloud computing, in general, is also gaining more attention as a cost issue to be addressed by software companies. Tightly coupling an application to the current way of doing things may lead to an architectural disadvantage in the future.</p>\n<p><b>Build defensibility the old-fashioned way. </b>While it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not clear whether an AI model itself \u00e2\u0080\u0093 or the underlying data \u00e2\u0080\u0093 will provide a long-term moat, good products and proprietary data almost always builds good businesses. AI gives founders a new angle on old problems. AI techniques, for example, have delivered novel value in the relatively sleepy malware detection market by simply showing better performance. The opportunity to build sticky products and enduring businesses on top of initial, unique product capabilities is evergreen. Interestingly, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve also seen several AI companies cement their market position through an effective cloud strategy, similar to the most recent generation of open-source companies.</p>\n<p>* * *</p>\n<p>To summarize: most AI systems today aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t <i>quite</i> software, in the traditional sense. And AI businesses, as a result, don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t look exactly like software businesses. They involve ongoing human support and material variable costs. They often don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t scale quite as easily as we\u00e2\u0080\u0099d like. And strong defensibility \u00e2\u0080\u0093 critical to the \u00e2\u0080\u009cbuild once / sell many times\u00e2\u0080\u009d software model \u00e2\u0080\u0093 doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t seem to come for free.</p>\n<p>These traits make AI feel, to an extent, like a services business. Put another way: you can replace the services firm, but you can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t (completely) replace the services.</p>\n<p>Believe it or not, this may be good news. Things like variable costs, scaling dynamics, and defensive moats are ultimately determined by markets \u00e2\u0080\u0093 not individual companies. The fact that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re seeing unfamiliar patterns in the data suggests AI companies are truly something new \u00e2\u0080\u0093 pushing into new markets and building massive opportunities.

Today text and images are the most mature applications of this technology, but there is work underway in virtually every creative domain, from animation, to sound effects, to music, to even creating virtual characters with fully fleshed out personalities.</p>\n<p>AI is nothing new in games, of course. Even early games, like Atari\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Pong, had computer-controlled opponents to challenge the player. These virtual foes, however, were not running AI as we know it today. They were simply scripted procedures crafted by game designers. They simulated an artificially intelligent opponent, but they couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t learn, and they were only as good as the programmers who built them.</p>\n<p>What\u00e2\u0080\u0099s different now is the amount of computing power available, thanks to faster microprocessors and the cloud.

The result is an explosion in interest and innovation.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Of all entertainment, games will be most impacted by Generative AI</strong></p>\n<p>Games are the most complex form of entertainment, in terms of the sheer number of asset types involved (2D art, 3D art, sound effects, music, dialog, etc). Games are also the most interactive, with a heavy emphasis on real-time experiences. This creates a steep barrier to entry for new game developers, as well as a steep cost to produce a modern, chart-topping game. It also creates a tremendous opportunity for Generative AI disruption.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Impact-from-Generative-AI-scaled.jpeg?ssl=1\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-316353 size-full\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"1280\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Impact-from-Generative-AI-scaled.jpeg?resize=2560%2C1280&amp;ssl=1\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Impact-from-Generative-AI-scaled.jpeg?w=2560&amp;ssl=1 2560w, https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Impact-from-Generative-AI-scaled.jpeg?resize=300%2C150&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Impact-from-Generative-AI-scaled.jpeg?resize=1024%2C512&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Impact-from-Generative-AI-scaled.jpeg?resize=768%2C384&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Impact-from-Generative-AI-scaled.jpeg?resize=1536%2C768&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Impact-from-Generative-AI-scaled.jpeg?resize=2048%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Impact-from-Generative-AI-scaled.jpeg?resize=125%2C63&amp;ssl=1 125w, https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Impact-from-Generative-AI-scaled.jpeg?resize=720%2C360&amp;ssl=1 720w, https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Impact-from-Generative-AI-scaled.jpeg?resize=590%2C295&amp;ssl=1 590w, https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Impact-from-Generative-AI-scaled.jpeg?resize=1120%2C560&amp;ssl=1 1120w\" width=\"2560\"/></a></p>\n<p>Consider a game like <a href=\"https://www.rockstargames.com/reddeadredemption2/\">Red Dead Redemption 2</a>, one of the most expensive games ever produced, costing nearly $500 million to make.

For example, they can enhance the \u00e2\u0080\u009chighway cloverleaf overpass\u00e2\u0080\u009d model, re-run the entire build process, and suddenly all the highway overpasses on the entire planet are improved.</p>\n<p><strong>3. There will be a generative AI model for every asset involved in game production</strong></p>\n<p>So far 2D image generators like Stable Diffusion, or MidJourney have captured the majority of the popular excitement over Generative AI due to the eye-catching nature of the images they can generate. But already there are Generative AI models for virtually all assets involved in games, from 3D models, to character animations, to dialog and music. The second half of this blog post includes a market map highlighting some of the companies focusing on each type of content.</p>\n<p><strong>4. The price of content will drop dramatically, going effectively to zero in some cases.</strong></p>\n<p>When talking to game developers who are experimenting with integrating Generative AI into their production pipeline, the greatest excitement is over the dramatic reduction in time and cost. One developer has told us that their time to generate concept art for a single image, start to finish, has dropped down from 3 weeks to a single hour: a 120-to-1 reduction. We believe similar savings will be possible across the entire production pipeline.</p>\n<p>To be clear, artists are not in danger of being replaced. It does mean that artists no longer need to do all the work themselves: they can now set initial creative direction, then hand off much of the time consuming and technical execution to an AI. In this, they are like cel painters from the early days of hand-drawn animation in which highly skilled \u00e2\u0080\u009cinkers\u00e2\u0080\u009d drew the outlines of animation, and then armies of lower-cost \u00e2\u0080\u009cpainters\u00e2\u0080\u009d would do the time-consuming work of painting the animation cels, filling in the lines. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the \u00e2\u0080\u009cauto-complete\u00e2\u0080\u009d for game creation.</p>\n<p><strong>5. We are still in the infancy of this revolution and a lot of practices still need to be refined</strong></p>\n<p>Despite all the recent excitement, we are still just at the starting line. There is an enormous amount of work ahead as we figure out how to harness this new technology for games, and enormous opportunities will be generated for companies who move quickly into this new space.</p>\n<h2><div class=\"toc-mobile-wrapper\"><h4>TABLE OF CONTENTS</h4><ul class=\"toc-list\"></ul></div><div data-toc-header=\"Predictions\" id=\"section--4\"></div></h2>\n<h2><strong>Predictions</strong></h2>\n<p>Given these assumptions, here are some predictions for how the game industry may be transformed:</p>\n<p><strong>1. Learning how to use Generative AI effectively will become a marketable skill</strong></p>\n<p>Already we are seeing some experimenters using Generative AI more effectively than others. To make the most use of this new technology requires using a variety of tools and techniques and knowing how to bounce between them. We predict this will become a marketable skill, combining the creative vision of an artist with the technical skills of a programmer.</p>\n<p>Chris Anderson is famous for saying, \u00e2\u0080\u009cEvery abundance creates a new scarcity.\u00e2\u0080\u009d As content becomes abundant, we believe it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the artists who know how to work most collaboratively and effectively with the AI tools who will be in the most short supply.</p>\n<p>For example, to use Generative AI for production artwork carries special challenges, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Coherence.</strong>\u00c2\u00a0With any production asset, you need to be able to make changes or edits to the asset down the road. With an AI tool, that means needing to be able to reproduce the asset with the same prompt, so you can then make changes. This can be tricky as the same prompt can generate vastly different outcomes.</li>\n<li><strong>Style.</strong>\u00c2\u00a0It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s important for all art in a given game to have a consistent style \u2013 which means your tools need to be trained on or otherwise tied to your given style.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>2. Lowering barriers will result in more risk-taking and creative exploration</strong></p>\n<p>We may soon be entering a new \u00e2\u0080\u009cgolden age\u00e2\u0080\u009d of game development, in which a lower barrier to entry results in an explosion of more innovative and creative games. Not just because lower production costs result in lower risk, but because these tools unlock the ability to create high-quality content for broader audiences. Which leads to the next prediction\u00e2\u0080\u00a6</p>\n<p><strong>3. A rise in AI-assisted \u00e2\u0080\u009cmicro game studios\u00e2\u0080\u009d</strong></p>\n<p>Armed with Generative AI tools and services, we will start to see more viable commercial games produced by tiny \u00e2\u0080\u009cmicro studios\u00e2\u0080\u009d of just 1 or 2 employees. The idea of a small indie game studio is not new \u00e2\u0080\u0093 hit game <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Among_Us\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Among Us</a> was created by studio Innersloth with just 5 employees \u00e2\u0080\u0093 but the size and scale of the games these small studios can create will grow. This will result in\u00e2\u0080\u00a6</p>\n<p><strong>4. An Increase in the number of games released each year</strong></p>\n<p>The success of Unity and Roblox have shown that providing powerful creative tools result in more games being built. Generative AI will lower the bar even further, creating an even greater number of games. The industry already suffers from discovery challenges \u00e2\u0080\u0093 more than <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/552623/number-games-released-steam/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">10,000 games were added to Steam</a> last year alone \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and this will put even more pressure on discovery. However we will also see\u00e2\u0080\u00a6</p>\n<p><strong>5. New game types created that were not possible before Generative AI</strong></p>\n<p>We will be seeing new game genres invented that were simply not possible without Generative AI. We already talked about Microsoft\u00e2\u0080\u0099s flight simulator, but there will be entirely new genres invented that depend on real-time generation of new content.</p>\n<p>Consider <a href=\"https://www.arrowmancer.com\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Arrowmancer</a>, by <a href=\"http://spellbrush.com\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Spellbrush</a>. This is an RPG game that features AI-created characters for virtually unlimited new gameplay.</p>\n<p>We also know of another game developer that is using AI to let players create their own in-game avatar. Previously they had a collection of hand-drawn avatar images that players could mix-and-match to create their avatar \u00e2\u0080\u0093 now they have thrown this out entirely, and are simply generating the avatar image from the player\u00e2\u0080\u0099s description. Letting players generate content through an AI is safer than letting players upload their own content from scratch, since the AI can be trained to avoid creating offensive content, while still giving players a greater sense of ownership.</p>\n<p><strong>6. Value will accrue to industry specific AI tools, and not just foundational models</strong></p>\n<p>The excitement and buzz around foundational models like Stable Diffusion and Midjourney are generating eye-popping valuations, but the continuing flood of new research ensures that new models will come and go as new techniques are refined. Consider website search traffic to 3 popular Generative AI models: Dall-E, Midjourney, and Stable Diffusion. Each new model has its turn in the spotlight.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Fig5-scaled.jpeg?ssl=1\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-316348 size-full\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"1202\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Fig5-scaled.jpeg?resize=2560%2C1202&amp;ssl=1\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Fig5-scaled.jpeg?w=2560&amp;ssl=1 2560w, https://i0.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Fig5-scaled.jpeg?resize=300%2C141&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Fig5-scaled.jpeg?resize=1024%2C481&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Fig5-scaled.jpeg?resize=768%2C361&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Fig5-scaled.jpeg?resize=1536%2C721&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Fig5-scaled.jpeg?resize=2048%2C962&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i0.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Fig5-scaled.jpeg?resize=125%2C59&amp;ssl=1 125w, https://i0.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Fig5-scaled.jpeg?resize=590%2C277&amp;ssl=1 590w, https://i0.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Fig5-scaled.jpeg?resize=1120%2C526&amp;ssl=1 1120w\" width=\"2560\"/></a></p>\n<p>An alternative approach may be to build industry aligned suites of tools that focus on the Generative AI needs of a given industry, with deep understanding of a particular audience, and rich integration into existing production pipelines (such as Unity or Unreal for games).</p>\n<p>A good example is <a href=\"https://runwayml.com/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Runway</a> which targets the needs of video creators with AI assisted tools like video editing, green screen removal, inpainting, and motion tracking. Tools like this can build and monetize a given audience, adding new models over time. We have not yet seen a suite such as Runway for games emerge yet, but we know it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a space of active development.</p>\n<p><strong>7. Legal challenges are coming</strong></p>\n<p>What all of these Generative AI models have in common is that they are trained using massive datasets of content, often created by scraping the Internet itself. Stable Diffusion, for example, is trained on more than 5 billion image/caption pairs, scraped from the web.</p>\n<p>At the moment these models are claiming to operate under the \u00e2\u0080\u009cfair use\u00e2\u0080\u009d copyright doctrine, but this argument has not yet been definitively tested in court. It seems clear that <a href=\"https://venturebeat.com/ai/why-generative-ai-legal-battles-are-brewing-the-ai-beat/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">legal challenges are coming</a> which will likely shift the landscape of Generative AI.</p>\n<p>It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s possible that large studios will seek competitive advantage by building proprietary models built on internal content they have clear right &amp; title to. Microsoft, for example, is especially well positioned here with <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_Game_Studios\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">23 first party studios today</a>, and another 7 after <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activision_Blizzard\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">its acquisition of Activision closes</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>8. Programming will not be disrupted as deeply as artistic content \u00e2\u0080\u0093 at least not yet</strong></p>\n<p>Software engineering is the other major cost of game development, but as our colleagues on the a16z Enterprise team have shared in their recent blog post, <a href=\"https://a16z.com/2022/11/16/creativity-as-an-app/\">Art Isn\u2019t Dead, It\u2019s Just Machine-Generated</a>, generating code with an AI model requires more testing and verification, and thus has a smaller productivity improvement than generating creative assets. Coding tools like Copilot may provide moderate performance improvements for engineers, but won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have the same impact\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 at least anytime soon.</p>\n<h2><div class=\"toc-mobile-wrapper\"><h4>TABLE OF CONTENTS</h4><ul class=\"toc-list\"></ul></div><div data-toc-header=\"Recommendations\" id=\"section--5\"></div></h2>\n<h2><strong>Recommendations</strong></h2>\n<p>Based on these predictions, we offer the following recommendations:</p>\n<p><strong>1. Start exploring Generative AI now</strong></p>\n<p>It\u2019s going to take a while to figure out how to fully leverage the power of this coming Generative AI revolution. Companies that start now will have an advantage later. We know several studios who have internal experimental projects underway to explore how these techniques can impact production.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Look for market map opportunities</strong></p>\n<p>Some parts of our market map are very crowded already, like Animations or Speech &amp; Dialog, but other areas are wide open.

Tools like <a href=\"https://www.midjourney.com/home/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Midjourney</a>, <a href=\"https://stability.ai/blog/stable-diffusion-announcement\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Stable Diffusion</a>, and <a href=\"https://openai.com/dall-e-2/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Dall-E 2</a> can generate high quality 2D images from text, and have already found their way into game production at multiple stages of the game life cycle.</p>\n<p><strong>Concept Art</strong></p>\n<p>Generative AI tools are excellent at \u00e2\u0080\u009cideation\u00e2\u0080\u009d or helping non-artists, like game designers, explore concepts and ideas very quickly to generate concept artwork, a key part of the production process. For example, one studio (staying anonymous) is using several of these tools together to radically speed up their concept art process, taking a single day to create an image that previously would have taken as long as 3 weeks.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>First, their game designers use Midjourney to explore different ideas and generate images they find inspiring.</li>\n<li>These get turned over to a professional concept artist who assembles them together and paints over the result to create a single coherent image \u00e2\u0080\u0093 which is then fed into Stable Diffusion to create a bunch of variations.</li>\n<li>They discuss these variations, pick one, paint in some edits manually \u00e2\u0080\u0093 then repeat the process until they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re happy with the result.</li>\n<li>At that stage, then pass this image back into Stable Diffusion one last time to \u00e2\u0080\u009cupscale\u00e2\u0080\u009d it to create the final piece of art.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>2D Production Art</strong></p>\n<p>Some studios are already experimenting with using the same tools for in-game production artwork. For example, here is a nice <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blXnuyVgA_Y\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">tutorial from Albert Bozesan</a> on using Stable Diffusion to create in-game 2D assets.</p>\n<h2><div class=\"toc-mobile-wrapper\"><h4>TABLE OF CONTENTS</h4><ul class=\"toc-list\"></ul></div><div data-toc-header=\"3D Artwork\" id=\"section--9\"></div> 3D Artwork</h2>\n<p>3D assets are the building block of all modern games, as well as the upcoming metaverse. A virtual world, or game level, is essentially just a collection of 3D assets, placed and modified to populate the environment. Creating a 3D asset, however, is more complex than creating a 2D image, and involves multiple steps including creating a 3D model and adding textures and effects. For animated characters, it also involves creating an internal \u00e2\u0080\u009cskeleton\u00e2\u0080\u009d, and then creating animations on top of that skeleton.</p>\n<p>We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re seeing several different startups going after each stage of this 3D asset creation process, including model creation, character animation, and level building. This is not yet a solved problem, however \u00e2\u0080\u0093 none of the solutions are ready to be fully integrated into production yet.</p>\n<p><strong>3D assets</strong></p>\n<p>Startups trying to solve the 3D model creation problem include <a href=\"https://www.kaedim3d.com/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Kaedim</a>, <a href=\"https://www.mirageml.com/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Mirage</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.hypothetic.art/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Hypothetic</a>. Larger companies are also looking at the problem, including Nvidia\u00e2\u0080\u0099s <a href=\"https://nv-tlabs.github.io/GET3D/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Get3D</a> and Autodesk\u00e2\u0080\u0099s <a href=\"https://github.com/AutodeskAILab/Clip-Forge\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">ClipForge</a>. Kaedim and Get3d are focused on image-to-3D; ClipForge and Mirage are focused on text-to-3D, while Hypothetic is interested in both text-to-3D search, as well as image-to-3D.</p>\n<p><strong>3D Textures</strong></p>\n<p>A 3D model only looks as realistic as the texture or materials that are applied to the mesh. Deciding which mossy, weathered stone texture to apply to a medieval castle model can completely change the look and feel of a scene. Textures contain metadata on how light reacts to the material (i.e. roughness, shininess, etc). Allowing artists to easily generate textures based on text or image prompts will be hugely valuable towards increasing iteration speed within the creative process. Several teams are pursuing this opportunity including <a href=\"https://barium.ai/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">BariumAI</a>, <a href=\"https://www.ponzu.gg/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Ponzu</a>, and <a href=\"https://armorlab.org/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">ArmorLab</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Animation</strong></p>\n<p>Creating great animation is one of the most time consuming, expensive, and skillful parts of the game creation process. One way to reduce the cost, and to create more realistic animation, is to use motion capture, in which you put an actor or dancer in a motion capture suit and record them moving in a specially instrumented motion capture stage.</p>\n<p>We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re now seeing Generative AI models that can capture animation straight from a video. This is much more efficient, both because it removes the need for an expensive motion capture rig, and because it means you can capture animation from existing videos. Another exciting aspect of these models is that they can also be used to apply filters to existing animations, such as making them look drunk, or old, or happy. Companies going after this space include <a href=\"https://www.kinetix.tech/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Kinetix</a>, <a href=\"https://www.deepmotion.com/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">DeepMotion</a>, <a href=\"https://getrad.co/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">RADiCAL</a>, <a href=\"https://www.move.ai/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Move Ai</a>, and <a href=\"https://plask.ai/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Plask</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Level design &amp; world building</strong></p>\n<p>One of the most time consuming aspects of game creation is building out the world of a game, a task that generative AI should be well suited to. Games like Minecraft, No Man\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Sky, and Diablo are already famous for using procedural techniques to generate their levels, in which levels are created randomly, different every time, but following rules laid down by the level designer. A big selling point of the new Unreal 5 game engine is its collection of procedural tools for open world design, such as foliage placement.</p>\n<p>We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen a few initiatives in the space, like <a href=\"https://www.prometheanai.com/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Promethean</a>, <a href=\"https://www.mlxar.com/\">MLXAR</a>, or Meta\u00e2\u0080\u0099s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62RJv514ijQ\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Builder Bot</a>, and think it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s only a matter of time before generative techniques largely replace procedural techniques. There has been academic research in the space for a while, including <a href=\"https://www.pcgworkshop.com/archive/salge2018generative.pdf\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">generative techniques for Minecraft</a> or <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.09154.pdf\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">level design in Doom</a>.</p>\n<p>Another compelling reason to look forward to generative AI tools for level design would be the ability to create levels and worlds in different styles. You could imagine asking tools to generate a world in 1920\u00e2\u0080\u0099s flapper era New York, vs dystopian blade-runner-esque future, vs. Tolkien-esque fantasy world.</p>\n<p>The following concepts were generated by Midjourney using the prompt, \u00e2\u0080\u009ca game level in the style of\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u009d</p>\n<h2><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Fig7-scaled.jpeg?ssl=1\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-316349 size-full\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"1171\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Fig7-scaled.jpeg?resize=2560%2C1171&amp;ssl=1\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Fig7-scaled.jpeg?w=2560&amp;ssl=1 2560w, https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Fig7-scaled.jpeg?resize=300%2C137&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Fig7-scaled.jpeg?resize=1024%2C468&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Fig7-scaled.jpeg?resize=768%2C351&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Fig7-scaled.jpeg?resize=1536%2C703&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Fig7-scaled.jpeg?resize=2048%2C937&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Fig7-scaled.jpeg?resize=125%2C57&amp;ssl=1 125w, https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Fig7-scaled.jpeg?resize=590%2C270&amp;ssl=1 590w, https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Fig7-scaled.jpeg?resize=1120%2C512&amp;ssl=1 1120w\" width=\"2560\"/><div class=\"toc-mobile-wrapper\"><h4>TABLE OF CONTENTS</h4><ul class=\"toc-list\"></ul></div><div data-toc-header=\"Audio\" id=\"section--10\"></div></a></h2>\n<h2>Audio</h2>\n<h2></h2>\n<p>Sound and music are a huge part of the gameplay experience. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re starting to see companies using Generative AI to generate audio to complement the work already happening on the graphics side.</p>\n<p><strong>Sound Effects</strong></p>\n<p>Sound effects are an attractive open area for AI. There have been <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.09262\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">academic papers</a> exploring the idea of using AI to generate \u00e2\u0080\u009cfoley\u00e2\u0080\u009d in film (e.g. footsteps) but few commercial products in gaming yet.</p>\n<p>We think this is only a matter of time, since the interactive nature of games make this an obvious application for generative AI, both creating static sound effects as part of production (\u00e2\u0080\u009claser gun sound, in the style of Star Wars\u00e2\u0080\u009d), and creating real-time interactive sound effects at run-time.</p>\n<p>Consider something as simple as generating footstep sounds for the player\u00e2\u0080\u0099s character. Most games solve this by including a small number of pre-recorded footstep sounds: walking on grass, walking on gravel, running on grass, running on gravel, etc. These are tedious to generate and manage, and sound repetitive and unrealistic at runtime.</p>\n<p>A better approach would be a real-time generative AI model for foley sound effects, that can generate appropriate sound effects, on the fly, slightly differently each time, that are responsive to in-game parameters such as ground surface, weight of character, gait, footwear, etc.</p>\n<p><strong>Music</strong></p>\n<p>Music has always been a challenge for games. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s important, since it can help set the emotional tone just as it does in film or television, but since games can last for hundreds or even thousands of hours, it can quickly become repetitive or annoying. Also, due to the interactive nature of games, it can be hard for the music to precisely match what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s happening on screen at any given time.</p>\n<p>Adaptive music has been a topic in game audio for more than two decades, going all the way back to Microsoft\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009c<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DirectMusic\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">DirectMusic</a>\u00e2\u0080\u009d system for creating interactive music. DirectMusic was never widely adapted, due largely to the difficulty of composing in the format. Only a few games, like Monolith\u00e2\u0080\u0099s <a href=\"https://www.iasig.org/index.php/resources/resources-menu/20-aan-no-one-lives-forever\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">No One Lives Forever</a>, created truly interactive scores.</p>\n<p>Now we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re seeing a number of companies trying to create AI generated music, such as <a href=\"https://soundful.com/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Soundful</a>, <a href=\"https://www.musi-co.com/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Musico</a>, <a href=\"https://www.harmonai.org/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Harmonai</a>, <a href=\"https://www.infinitealbum.io/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Infinite Album</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.aiva.ai/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Aiva</a>. And while some tools today, like <a href=\"https://openai.com/blog/jukebox/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Jukebox</a> by Open AI, are highly computationally intensive and can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t run in real-time, the majority can run in real-time once the initial model is built.</p>\n<p><strong>Speech and Dialog</strong></p>\n<p>There are a large number of companies trying to create realistic voices for in-game characters. This is not surprising given the long history of trying to give computers a voice through speech synthesis. Companies include <a href=\"https://www.sonantic.io/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Sonantic</a>, <a href=\"https://coqui.ai/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Coqui</a>, <a href=\"https://replicastudios.com/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Replica Studios</a>, <a href=\"https://www.resemble.ai/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Resemble.ai</a>, <a href=\"https://www.readspeaker.ai/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Readspeaker.ai</a>, and many more.</p>\n<p>There are multiple advantages to using generative AI for speech, which partly explains why this space is so crowded.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Generate dialog on-the-fly.</strong> Typically speech in games is pre-recorded from voice actors, but these are limited to pre-recorded canned speeches. With generative AI dialog, characters can say anything \u00e2\u0080\u0093 which means they can fully react to what players are doing. Combined with more intelligent AI models for NPC\u00e2\u0080\u0099s (outside the scope of this blog, but an equally exciting area of innovation right now), the promise of games that are fully reactive to players are coming soon.</li>\n<li><strong>Role playing.</strong> Many players want to play as fantasy characters that bear little resemblance to their real-world identity. This fantasy breaks down, however, as soon as players speak in their own voices. Using a generated voice that matches the player\u00e2\u0080\u0099s avatar maintains that illusion.<br/>\nControl. As the speech is generated, you can control the nuance of the voice like its tambre, inflection, emotional resonance, phoneme length, accents, and more.</li>\n<li><strong>Localization.</strong> Allows dialog to be translated into any language and spoken in the same voice. Companies like <a href=\"https://deepdub.ai/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Deepdub</a> are focused specifically on this niche.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><div class=\"toc-mobile-wrapper\"><h4>TABLE OF CONTENTS</h4><ul class=\"toc-list\"></ul></div><div data-toc-header=\"NPCs or player characters\" id=\"section--11\"></div></h2>\n<h2>NPCs or player characters</h2>\n<p>Many startups are looking at using generative AI to create believable characters you can interact with, partly because this is a market with such wide applicability outside of games, such as virtual assistants or receptionists.</p>\n<p>Efforts to create believable characters go back to the beginnings of AI research. In fact, the definition of the classic \u00e2\u0080\u009cTuring Test\u00e2\u0080\u009d for artificial intelligence is that a human should be unable to distinguish between a chat conversation with an AI versus a human.</p>\n<p>At this point there are hundreds of companies building general purpose chatbots, many of them powered by the GPT-3 like language models. A smaller number are specifically trying to build chatbots for the purpose of entertainment, such as <a href=\"https://replika.com/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Replika</a> and <a href=\"https://myanima.ai/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Anima</a> who are trying to build virtual friends. The concept of dating a virtual girlfriend, as explored in the movie Her, may be closer than you think.</p>\n<p>We are now seeing the next iteration of these chatbot platforms, such as <a href=\"https://charisma.ai/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Charisma.ai</a>, <a href=\"https://convai.com/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Convai.com</a>, or <a href=\"https://inworld.ai/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Inworld.ai</a>, meant to power fully rendered 3D characters, with emotions, and agency, with tools to allow the creator to give these characters goals. This is important if they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to fit within a game or have a narrative place in advancing the plot forward, versus purely being window dressing.</p>\n<h2><div class=\"toc-mobile-wrapper\"><h4>TABLE OF CONTENTS</h4><ul class=\"toc-list\"></ul></div><div data-toc-header=\"All-in-one platforms\" id=\"section--12\"></div></h2>\n<h2>All-in-one platforms</h2>\n<p>One of the most successful generative AI tools at large is <a href=\"https://runwayml.com/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Runwayml.com</a>, because it brings together a broad suite of creator tools in a single package.

But for most creators, that amounts to a meager living: a </span><a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-02-27/-success-on-youtube-still-means-a-life-of-poverty\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2018 report</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> found that the top 3 percent of video creators accounted for nearly 90 percent of total views on YouTube. Even those who broke into that coveted top 3 percent were still only earning about $16,800 in ad revenue annually.\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now, through the rise of short-form video content platforms like TikTok, Instagram, YouTube, and Pinterest, we are entering a new era of native ecommerce. Entrepreneurs ranging from farmers to indie craftspeople to clothing designers are able to reach shoppers directly through self-recorded video clips. Soon we will think of video apps as a platform not only for entertainment, but for retail.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This shift creates a huge opportunity for existing brands, solo creators, and upstarts. In this format, the cost of A/B testing is extremely low, meaning sellers benefit from instant feedback. As experimentation with ecommerce and video continues, brands will also harness the wisdom of the crowds in R&amp;D.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The monetization of short video is already happening in Asia. On Taobao, China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s largest ecommerce platform, <a href=\"http://www.sohu.com/a/255708166_182907\">42 percent</a></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00c2\u00a0of product pages already include short videos and live streaming is growing quickly. From January to August 2018, the company generated more than </span><a href=\"https://t.cj.sina.com.cn/articles/view/1771650130/69993c5202700e7fa\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">$15 billion</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in sales through livestreams, up nearly 400 percent over the year before. Thus, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no surprise that short video apps are the next frontier for ecommerce in the US, fueled by the rise of native shops and integrations with popular third-party platforms. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">(We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re likely to see more video being incorporated into Amazon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s product pages and other shopping pages, as well.) </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here are some examples of how brands are leveraging short video entertainment apps for commerce in China.</span></p>\n<h3>Authentic farm to table</h3>\n<p>There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a new subset of influencers in Chinese video apps: rural farmers. These farmers live-stream daily from their orchards, harnessing short video to show off the juiciness and rare varieties of their fruit. By selling directly to consumers instead of through grocers, farms can reach far more customers and earn more money. Meanwhile, viewers can support independent growers\u00e2\u0080\u0094meeting the face behind their fruit\u00e2\u0080\u0094and receive fresher produce than what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s available in local markets.</p>\n<p>Ms. Feng, for instance, is a medium-sized fruit influencer in Sichuan province who broadcasts to 218K followers. Her orchard grows sugarcane and pomegranates, but she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s best known for \u00e2\u0080\u009csugar heart\u00e2\u0080\u009d apples, named after the fruit\u00e2\u0080\u0099s heart-like appearance. This is not your ordinary supermarket apple.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-video\" style=\"width: 346px;\"><!--[if lt IE 9]><script>document.createElement('video');</script><![endif]-->\n<video class=\"wp-video-shortcode\" controls=\"controls\" height=\"614\" id=\"video-296801-1\" preload=\"metadata\" width=\"346\"><source src=\"https://a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/apples.mp4?_=1\" type=\"video/mp4\"/><a href=\"https://a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/apples.mp4\">https://a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/apples.mp4</a></video></div>\n<h3>Product testing in action</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.searchenginejournal.com/amazon-search-engine-ranking-algorithm-explained/265173/\">Seventy percent</a> of Amazon shoppers never click past the first page of search results. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s because the platform\u00e2\u0080\u0099s homogenized product listings\u00e2\u0080\u0094title, price, photo, and star rating\u00e2\u0080\u0094are built for search, not discovery. As a result, sales are more about SEO, less about finding new or innovative products.</p>\n<p>By contrast, discovery-driven video platforms like Douyin (the Chinese version of TikTok) and Kwai have one simple rule for acquiring an audience: be entertaining. You might think that, sans search, the viral potential of everyday products like phone screen protectors would be low. Douyin proves that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not the case: Rather than claiming to be the safest phone screen protector, why not show its durability with drop videos and unexpected use cases?</p>\n<div class=\"wp-video\" style=\"width: 346px;\"><video class=\"wp-video-shortcode\" controls=\"controls\" height=\"614\" id=\"video-296801-2\" preload=\"metadata\" width=\"346\"><source src=\"https://a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/short-video-tempered-glass.mp4?_=2\" type=\"video/mp4\"/><a href=\"https://a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/short-video-tempered-glass.mp4\">https://a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/short-video-tempered-glass.mp4</a></video></div>\n<h3>Fashion as entertainment</h3>\n<p>In the future, clothes shopping will be interactive. Instead of scrolling through static pictures or browsing by category, you can watch as a model tries on outfits in quick succession\u00e2\u0080\u0094every one of them purchasable. On Douyin, this is the status quo for fashion influencers, who might showcase five to 10 outfits in a single 15-second video. Shopping in this way is entertaining\u00e2\u0080\u0094more like watching a challenge than dutifully clicking through photos.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-video\" style=\"width: 346px;\"><video class=\"wp-video-shortcode\" controls=\"controls\" height=\"614\" id=\"video-296801-3\" preload=\"metadata\" width=\"346\"><source src=\"https://a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/outfits.mp4?_=3\" type=\"video/mp4\"/><a href=\"https://a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/outfits.mp4\">https://a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/outfits.mp4</a></video></div>\n<h3>Click-to-buy unboxing</h3>\n<p>Unboxing videos, in which shoppers record themselves unpacking a recent purchase in real time, are huge on YouTube. Such content builds excitement\u00e2\u0080\u0094the grand reveal!\u00e2\u0080\u0094and capture the user\u00e2\u0080\u0099s genuine first impressions. The format also translates well to short video: it makes this otherwise unremarkable kitchen organizer kit seem covetable.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-video\" style=\"width: 346px;\"><video class=\"wp-video-shortcode\" controls=\"controls\" height=\"614\" id=\"video-296801-4\" preload=\"metadata\" width=\"346\"><source src=\"https://a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/spice-cabinet.mp4?_=4\" type=\"video/mp4\"/><a href=\"https://a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/spice-cabinet.mp4\">https://a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/spice-cabinet.mp4</a></video></div>\n<h3>Showcasing the craft behind the product</h3>\n<p>It may sound counterintuitive in the era of cheap manufacturing and automation, but the market for handmade goods is <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-12-13/investors-are-obsessed-with-handmade-crafts-right-now\">booming</a>. While most handmade goods platforms in the United States rely heavily on text and photos\u00e2\u0080\u0094the Etsy model\u00e2\u0080\u0094video is a far superior medium. The format not only illustrates the craftsmanship behind the merchandise, it gives customers the ability to interact with creators.</p>\n<p>For most of his life, Wan Shishan made a meager income exporting traditional paper umbrellas to Japan. But when he made a Douyin account in April and posted his artistic process\u00e2\u0080\u0094the craft dates back more than 2,500 years\u00e2\u0080\u0094he made <a href=\"https://m.21jingji.com/article/20190605/herald/12fc2db6a4a728748f02f99e7aa11698.html\">$15,000</a> in his first month. He now has more than 800K followers, and the following video has earned over 300K likes.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-video\" style=\"width: 346px;\"><video class=\"wp-video-shortcode\" controls=\"controls\" height=\"614\" id=\"video-296801-5\" preload=\"metadata\" width=\"346\"><source src=\"https://a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/umbrella.mp4?_=5\" type=\"video/mp4\"/><a href=\"https://a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/umbrella.mp4\">https://a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/umbrella.mp4</a></video></div>\n<h3>Food as a lifestyle brand</h3>\n<p>There are an infinite number of ways to sell products through short video. Now even ordinary food items can be showcased as lifestyle brands. For example, the following video for instant noodles (which almost has a TV-commercial feel to it) has received more than 230,000 likes and 5,000 shares.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-video\" style=\"width: 346px;\"><video class=\"wp-video-shortcode\" controls=\"controls\" height=\"614\" id=\"video-296801-6\" preload=\"metadata\" width=\"346\"><source src=\"https://a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/short-video-ramen.mp4?_=6\" type=\"video/mp4\"/><a href=\"https://a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/short-video-ramen.mp4\">https://a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/short-video-ramen.mp4</a></video></div>\n<h3>Short-form tutorials</h3>\n<p>Tutorials have become staples in the beauty sphere, but they can also be a helpful tool for creators. The following seller films tutorials to promote his photography books, essentially using short video to build trust in his products. In snippets, he teaches viewers techniques to take great photos with their smartphones. Rather than displaying the product, these videos showcase the book\u00e2\u0080\u0099s value in action. Beyond basic book details, the product page gives potential buyers additional information as well, such as the table of contents and screenshots of WeChat user testimonials.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-video\" style=\"width: 346px;\"><video class=\"wp-video-shortcode\" controls=\"controls\" height=\"614\" id=\"video-296801-7\" preload=\"metadata\" width=\"346\"><source src=\"https://a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/short-video-photography-book.mp4?_=7\" type=\"video/mp4\"/><a href=\"https://a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/short-video-photography-book.mp4\">https://a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/short-video-photography-book.mp4</a></video></div>\n<h3>AI-driven impulse buys</h3>\n<p>Purchases on traditional ecommerce platforms rely on user intent\u00e2\u0080\u0094customers typically search for a product and select one of the top results. But Douyin\u00e2\u0080\u0099s use of AI drives impulse purchases of things users wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think to search for. One such item: this expandable grocery tote for $4. Payment credentials and shipping addresses are automatically saved in the app, making the experience more efficient and user-friendly than any infomercial.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-video\" style=\"width: 346px;\"><video class=\"wp-video-shortcode\" controls=\"controls\" height=\"614\" id=\"video-296801-8\" preload=\"metadata\" width=\"346\"><source src=\"https://a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/expandable-bag.mp4?_=8\" type=\"video/mp4\"/><a href=\"https://a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/expandable-bag.mp4\">https://a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/expandable-bag.mp4</a></video></div>\n<h2>The power of short video</h2>\n<p>In the US, advertising has long been the established monetization model for video creators. But as YouTubers duke it out for ad revenue, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s becoming increasingly difficult for new influencers to make a living. As evidenced by Chinese platforms like Taobao, Kwai, and Douyin, video apps present a compelling alternative to monetize content, sell products, and <a href=\"https://a16z.com/2019/08/06/ecommerce-as-videos-killer-app/\">reach viewers directly</a>.</p>\n<p>In the future, as more apps become super apps, \u00e2\u0080\u009cclick to purchase\u00e2\u0080\u009d will be ubiquitous. But the potential of short video extends far beyond straightforward transactions into the marketing and discovery phase, showcasing craftsmanship, tutorials, and product tests, and more. A 2018 survey found that <a href=\"https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20181106005100/en\">85 percent</a> of millennials in the US reported buying a product or service after watching a video. As video apps launch native shops and integrate with third-party platforms, that statistic is likely to rise.</p>\n<p>Related reading:<br/>\n<a href=\"https://a16z.com/2019/08/06/ecommerce-as-videos-killer-app/\">Ecommerce as Video\u2019s Killer App</a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">***</p>\n<p><em>The views expressed here are those of the individual AH Capital Management, L.L.C.

With scars from the heyday of Webvan and Pets.com still fresh in the investor psyche, people are asking, \u201cIsn\u2019t this just a dangerous new bubble?\u201d</p>\n<p>I, along with others, have been arguing the other side of the case. (I am co-founder and general partner of venture capital firm Andreessen-Horowitz, which has invested in Facebook, Groupon, Skype, Twitter, Zynga, and Foursquare, among others. I am also personally an investor in LinkedIn.) We believe that many of the prominent new Internet companies are building real, high-growth, high-margin, highly defensible businesses.</p>\n<p>Today\u2019s stock market actually hates technology, as shown by all-time low price/earnings ratios for major public technology companies. Apple, for example, has a P/E ratio of around 15.2 \u2014 about the same as the broader stock market, despite Apple\u2019s immense profitability and dominant market position (Apple in the last couple weeks became the biggest company in America, judged by market capitalization, surpassing Exxon Mobil). And, perhaps most telling, you can\u2019t have a bubble when people are constantly screaming \u201cBubble!\u201d</p>\n<p>But too much of the debate is still around financial valuation, as opposed to the underlying intrinsic value of the best of Silicon Valley\u2019s new companies. My own theory is that we are in the middle of a dramatic and broad technological and economic shift in which software companies are poised to take over large swathes of the economy.</p>\n<p>More and more major businesses and industries are being run on software and delivered as online services \u2014 from movies to agriculture to national defense. Many of the winners are Silicon Valley-style entrepreneurial technology companies that are invading and overturning established industry structures. Over the next 10 years, I expect many more industries to be disrupted by software, with new world-beating Silicon Valley companies doing the disruption in more cases than not.</p>\n<p>Why is this happening now?</p>\n<p>Six decades into the computer revolution, four decades since the invention of the microprocessor, and two decades into the rise of the modern Internet, all of the technology required to transform industries through software finally works and can be widely delivered at global scale.</p>\n<p>Over two billion people now use the broadband Internet, up from perhaps 50 million a decade ago, when I was at Netscape, the company I co-founded. In the next 10 years, I expect at least five billion people worldwide to own smartphones, giving every individual with such a phone instant access to the full power of the Internet, every moment of every day.</p>\n<p>On the back end, software programming tools and Internet-based services make it easy to launch new global software-powered start-ups in many industries \u2014 without the need to invest in new infrastructure and train new employees. In 2000, when my partner Ben Horowitz was CEO of the first cloud computing company, Loudcloud, the cost of a customer running a basic Internet application was approximately $150,000 a month. Running that same application today in Amazon\u2019s cloud costs about $1,500 a month.</p>\n<p>With lower start-up costs and a vastly expanded market for online services, the result is a global economy that for the first time will be fully digitally wired \u2014 the dream of every cyber-visionary of the early 1990s, finally delivered, a full generation later.</p>\n<p>Perhaps the single most dramatic example of this phenomenon of software eating a traditional business is the suicide of Borders and corresponding rise of Amazon. In 2001, Borders agreed to hand over its online business to Amazon under the theory that online book sales were non-strategic and unimportant.</p>\n<p>Oops.</p>\n<p>Today, the world\u2019s largest bookseller, Amazon, is a software company \u2014 its core capability is its amazing software engine for selling virtually everything online, no retail stores necessary. On top of that, while Borders was thrashing in the throes of impending bankruptcy, Amazon rearranged its web site to promote its Kindle digital books over physical books for the first time. Now even the books themselves are software.</p>\n<p>Today\u2019s largest video service by number of subscribers is a software company: Netflix. How Netflix eviscerated Blockbuster is an old story, but now other traditional entertainment providers are facing the same threat. Comcast, Time Warner and others are responding by transforming themselves into software companies with efforts such as TV Everywhere, which liberates content from the physical cable and connects it to smartphones and tablets.</p>\n<p>Today\u2019s dominant music companies are software companies, too: Apple\u2019s iTunes, Spotify and Pandora. Traditional record labels increasingly exist only to provide those software companies with content. Industry revenue from digital channels totaled $4.6 billion in 2010, growing to 29% of total revenue from 2% in 2004.</p>\n<p>Today\u2019s fastest growing entertainment companies are videogame makers \u2014 again, software \u2014 with the industry growing to $60 billion from $30 billion five years ago. And the fastest growing major videogame company is Zynga (maker of games including FarmVille), which delivers its games entirely online. Zynga\u2019s first-quarter revenues grew to $235 million this year, more than double revenues from a year earlier. Rovio, maker of Angry Birds, is expected to clear $100 million in revenue this year (the company was nearly bankrupt when it debuted the popular game on the iPhone in late 2009). Meanwhile, traditional videogame powerhouses like Electronic Arts and Nintendo have seen revenues stagnate and fall.</p>\n<p>The best new movie production company in many decades, Pixar, was a software company. Disney \u2014 Disney! \u2014 had to buy Pixar, a software company, to remain relevant in animated movies.</p>\n<p>Photography, of course, was eaten by software long ago. It\u2019s virtually impossible to buy a mobile phone that doesn\u2019t include a software-powered camera, and photos are uploaded automatically to the Internet for permanent archiving and global sharing. Companies like Shutterfly, Snapfish and Flickr have stepped into Kodak\u2019s place.</p>\n<p>Today\u2019s largest direct marketing platform is a software company \u2014 Google. Now it\u2019s been joined by Groupon, Living Social, Foursquare and others, which are using software to eat the retail marketing industry. Groupon generated over $700 million in revenue in 2010, after being in business for only two years.</p>\n<p>Today\u2019s fastest growing telecom company is Skype, a software company that was just bought by Microsoft for $8.5 billion. CenturyLink, the third largest telecom company in the U.S., with a $20 billion market cap, had 15 million access lines at the end of June 30 \u2013declining at an annual rate of about 7%. Excluding the revenue from its Qwest acquisition, CenturyLink\u2019s revenue from these legacy services declined by more than 11%. Meanwhile, the two biggest telecom companies, AT&amp;T and Verizon, have survived by transforming themselves into software companies, partnering with Apple and other smartphone makers.</p>\n<p>LinkedIn is today\u2019s fastest growing recruiting company. For the first time ever, on LinkedIn, employees can maintain their own resumes for recruiters to search in real time \u2014 giving LinkedIn the opportunity to eat the lucrative $400 billion recruiting industry.</p>\n<p>Software is also eating much of the value chain of industries that are widely viewed as primarily existing in the physical world. In today\u2019s cars, software runs the engines, controls safety features, entertains passengers, guides drivers to destinations and connects each car to mobile, satellite and GPS networks. The days when a car aficionado could repair his or her own car are long past, due primarily to the high software content. The trend toward hybrid and electric vehicles will only accelerate the software shift \u2014 electric cars are completely computer controlled. And the creation of software-powered driverless cars is already under way at Google and the major car companies.</p>\n<p>Today\u2019s leading real-world retailer, Wal-Mart, uses software to power its logistics and distribution capabilities, which it has used to crush its competition. Likewise for FedEx, which is best thought of as a software network that happens to have trucks, planes and distribution hubs attached. And the success or failure of airlines today and in the future hinges on their ability to price tickets and optimize routes and yields correctly \u2014 with software.</p>\n<p>Oil and gas companies were early innovators in supercomputing and data visualization and analysis, which are crucial to today\u2019s oil and gas exploration efforts. Agriculture is increasingly powered by software as well, including satellite analysis of soils linked to per-acre seed selection software algorithms.</p>\n<p>The financial services industry has been visibly transformed by software over the last 30 years. Practically every financial transaction, from someone buying a cup of coffee to someone trading a trillion dollars of credit default derivatives, is done in software. And many of the leading innovators in financial services are software companies, such as Square, which allows anyone to accept credit card payments with a mobile phone, and PayPal, which generated more than $1 billion in revenue in the second quarter of this year, up 31% over the previous year.</p>\n<p>Health care and education, in my view, are next up for fundamental software-based transformation. My venture capital firm is backing aggressive start-ups in both of these gigantic and critical industries. We believe both of these industries, which historically have been highly resistant to entrepreneurial change, are primed for tipping by great new software-centric entrepreneurs.</p>\n<p>Even national defense is increasingly software-based. The modern combat soldier is embedded in a web of software that provides intelligence, communications, logistics and weapons guidance. Software-powered drones launch airstrikes without putting human pilots at risk. Intelligence agencies do large-scale data mining with software to uncover and track potential terrorist plots.</p>\n<p>Companies in every industry need to assume that a software revolution is coming. This includes even industries that are software-based today. Great incumbent software companies like Oracle and Microsoft are increasingly threatened with irrelevance by new software offerings like Salesforce.com and Android (especially in a world where Google owns a major handset maker).</p>\n<p>In some industries, particularly those with a heavy real-world component such as oil and gas, the software revolution is primarily an opportunity for incumbents. But in many industries, new software ideas will result in the rise of new Silicon Valley-style start-ups that invade existing industries with impunity. Over the next 10 years, the battles between incumbents and software-powered insurgents will be epic. Joseph Schumpeter, the economist who coined the term \u201ccreative destruction,\u201d would be proud.</p>\n<p>And while people watching the values of their 401(k)s bounce up and down the last few weeks might doubt it, this is a profoundly positive story for the American economy, in particular. It\u2019s not an accident that many of the biggest recent technology companies \u2014 including Google, Amazon, eBay and more \u2014 are American companies. Our combination of great research universities, a pro-risk business culture, deep pools of innovation-seeking equity capital and reliable business and contract law is unprecedented and unparalleled in the world.</p>\n<p>Still, we face several challenges.</p>\n<p>First of all, every new company today is being built in the face of massive economic headwinds, making the challenge far greater than it was in the relatively benign \u201990s. The good news about building a company during times like this is that the companies that do succeed are going to be extremely strong and resilient. And when the economy finally stabilizes, look out \u2014 the best of the new companies will grow even faster.</p>\n<p>Secondly, many people in the U.S. and around the world lack the education and skills required to participate in the great new companies coming out of the software revolution. This is a tragedy since every company I work with is absolutely starved for talent. Qualified software engineers, managers, marketers and salespeople in Silicon Valley can rack up dozens of high-paying, high-upside job offers any time they want, while national unemployment and underemployment is sky high. This problem is even worse than it looks because many workers in existing industries will be stranded on the wrong side of software-based disruption and may never be able to work in their fields again. There\u2019s no way through this problem other than education, and we have a long way to go.</p>\n<p>Finally, the new companies need to prove their worth. They need to build strong cultures, delight their customers, establish their own competitive advantages and, yes, justify their rising valuations. No one should expect building a new high-growth, software-powered company in an established industry to be easy. It\u2019s brutally difficult.</p>\n<p>I\u2019m privileged to work with some of the best of the new breed of software companies, and I can tell you they\u2019re really good at what they do. If they perform to my and others\u2019 expectations, they are going to be highly valuable cornerstone companies in the global economy, eating markets far larger than the technology industry has historically been able to pursue.</p>\n<p>Instead of constantly questioning their valuations, let\u2019s seek to understand how the new generation of technology companies are doing what they do, what the broader consequences are for businesses and the economy and what we can collectively do to expand the number of innovative new software companies created in the U.S. and around the world.</p>\n<p>That\u2019s the big opportunity. I know where I\u2019m putting my money.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Originally <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424053111903480904576512250915629460\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">published</a> in The Wall Street Journal on August 20, 2011.\u00c2\u00a0</em></strong></p>\n", "author": "Marc Andreessen"}, "144": {"podcast": "a16z Podcast: Words of 2020!

Video. Podcasts. Newsletters.", "crawled": true, "body": "\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">From the beginning, </span><a href=\"https://a16z.com/crypto/#vertical-landing-investment-thesis\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">our core thesis</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> has been that the best way to think of a modern blockchain is as a new class of computer that has the ability to run a special kind of program. These programs are sometimes called smart contracts, and they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re different from ordinary programs in that they have a life of their own. They are independent, and once written, they obediently execute themselves subject to nobody\u00e2\u0080\u0099s authority. Because of this property, smart contracts are uniquely capable of earning trust.\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">But smart contracts today have two big limitations: (1) they are fully transparent by design and therefore don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t allow for privacy (2) they don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t scale to millions (let alone billions) of users. These limitations exist because trust requires verification. Transactions on a blockchain need to be transparent so that everyone can verify that they are correct. And, they tend not to scale because it takes time and energy for all computers on the network to perform that verification.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">But research in a cutting edge area of cryptography called zero-knowledge proofs promises to unlock an elegant solution to the privacy and scalability problems. We spent a great deal of time looking at various approaches and teams working on this. </span><a href=\"https://www.aleo.org/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Aleo</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u00e2\u0080\u0099s solution is both elegant and pragmatic.</span></p>\n<p><b>Enter Aleo</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">We first met Howard Wu, Aleo\u00e2\u0080\u0099s founder, back in 2018. We were immediately impressed by the depth of his knowledge in cryptography and distributed systems, and by his vision for crypto\u00e2\u0080\u0099s potential. He was collaborating closely with a number of prominent academics from Berkeley, Cornell and other institutions on Zero-Knowledge Proof research. Later that year, Howard published a seminal paper in this space with many of those same collaborators titled </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u00e2\u0080\u009c</span></i><a href=\"https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/962.pdf\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Zexe: Enabling Decentralized Private Computation</span></i></a><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">.\u00e2\u0080\u009d </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">It describes how it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s possible to change the way that transactions on a blockchain are verified so that it can be done privately and more efficiently. The trick lies in the use of a cryptographic primitive that allows any participant in the network to create a short mathematical proof that a transaction was processed correctly, but that doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t reveal any details about the transaction itself. The magical primitive that makes this possible is called a zero-knowledge proof (or zk-proof). The result with Zexe is a template for a blockchain that is entirely private and that scales far beyond most blockchains that are live today.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The implications of this idea are more profound than they might seem at first. Privacy is important as a feature, not just because it protects users\u00e2\u0080\u0099 personal data, but also because it fundamentally extends the design space for applications. There are things that can be built with a private smart contract that are simply impossible to build with a transparent one. For example, a simple game that hands out cards face-down to different players would need some way to make sure that those cards aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t immediately visible to everyone playing. Building such a game on today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s blockchains is simply not possible \u00e2\u0080\u0094 it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s too easy for the players to cheat by inspecting the blockchain and looking at each other\u00e2\u0080\u0099s cards. With Aleo, on the other hand, building a game like this will be straightforward. Of course, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just a toy example, but the point is that a blockchain like Aleo unlocks a whole new realm of possible applications.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">When we reconnected with Howard and team a couple months ago, it became immediately clear that the team he\u00e2\u0080\u0099d brought together is world class. Their pace of execution is one of the most impressive we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen, even by crypto standards. Not only do they now have a live testnet of their protocol, but they have also built a full programming language for Aleo called </span><a href=\"https://developer.aleo.org/developer/language/flying_tour\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Leo</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> and a development environment called </span><a href=\"https://aleo.studio/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Aleo Studio</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">; both of these together make for a great developer experience. We are also very excited that our former partner, Alex Pruden, is now Aleo\u00e2\u0080\u0099s COO.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Given the breakthrough technology, the huge idea, and this team, we are thrilled to announce that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re leading Aleo\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Series A, partnering with Howard and the team to help make their vision a reality.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\">* * *</p>\n<p><em>The views expressed here are those of the individual AH Capital Management, L.L.C.

While you may be able to borrow time by writing quick and dirty code, you will eventually have to pay it back\u00e2\u0080\u0094with interest. Often this trade-off makes sense, but you will run into serious trouble if you fail to keep the trade-off in the front of your mind. There also exists a less well-understood parallel concept, which I will call\u00c2\u00a0<em>management debt</em>.</p>\n<p>Like technical debt, management debt is incurred when you make an expedient, short-term management decision with an expensive, long-term consequence. Also like technical debt, the trade-off sometimes makes sense, but often does not. More importantly, if you incur the management debt without accounting for it, then you will eventually go\u00c2\u00a0<em>management bankrupt</em>.</p>\n<p>Like technical debt, management debt comes in too many different forms to elaborate entirely, but a few salient examples will help explain the concept. For this post, I choose 3 of the more popular types among startups:</p>\n<p>1. Putting two in the box</p>\n<p>2. Over compensating a key employee, because she gets another job offer</p>\n<p>3. No performance management or employee feedback process</p>\n<h2>Putting two in the box</h2>\n<p>What do you do when you have two outstanding employees who logically both fit in the exact same place on the organizational chart? Perhaps you have a world-class architect who is running engineering, but she does not have the experience to scale the organization to the next level. You also have an outstanding operational person who is not great technically. You want to keep both in the company, but you only have one position. So, you get the bright idea to put \u00e2\u0080\u009ctwo in the box\u00e2\u0080\u009d and take on a little management debt. The short-term benefits are clear: a) you keep both employees, b) you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have to develop either because they will theoretically help each other develop, c) you instantly close the skill set gap. Unfortunately, you will pay for those benefits with interest and at a very high interest rate.</p>\n<p>For starters, by doing this you will make every engineer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s job more difficult. If an engineer needs a decision made, which boss should she go to? If that boss decides, will the other boss be able to override it? If it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a complex decision that requires a meeting, does she have to schedule both heads of engineering for the meeting? Who sets the direction for the organization? Will the direction actually get set if doing so requires a series of meetings?</p>\n<p>In addition, you have removed all accountability. If schedules slip, who is accountable? If engineering throughput becomes uncompetitive, who is responsible? If the operational head is responsible for the schedule slip and the technical head is responsible for throughput, what happens if the operational head thrashes the engineers to make the schedule and kills throughput? How would you know that she did that? The really expensive part about both of these things is that they tend to get worse over time. In the very short-term you might mitigate these effects with extra meetings or by attempting to carve up the job in a clear way. However, as things get busy the mitigation will fade and the organization will degenerate. Eventually, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll either make a lump sum payment by making the hard decision and putting one in the box or your engineering organization will suck forever.</p>\n<h2>Over compensating a key employee because she gets another job offer</h2>\n<p>An excellent engineer decides to leave the company because she gets a better offer. For various reasons, you were undercompensating her, but the offer from the other company pays more than any engineer in your company and the engineer in question is not your best engineer. Still, she is working on a critical project and you cannot afford to lose her. So you match the offer. You save the project, but you pile on the debt.</p>\n<p>Here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s how the payment will come due. You probably think that your counteroffer was confidential because you\u00e2\u0080\u0099d sworn her to secrecy. Let me explain why it was not. She has friends in the company. When she got the offer from the other company, she consulted with her friends. One of her best friends advised her to take the offer. When she decided to stay, she had to explain to him why she disregarded his advice or lose personal credibility. So she told him and swore him to secrecy. He agreed to honor the secret, but was incensed that she had to threaten to quit in order to get a proper raise. Furthermore, he was furious that you overcompensated her. So, he told the story, but kept her name confidential to preserve the secret. And now everyone in engineering knows that the best way to get a raise is to generate an offer from another company then threaten to quit. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to take awhile to pay off that debt.</p>\n<h2>No performance management or employee feedback process</h2>\n<p>Your company is now 25 people and you know that you should formalize the performance management process, but you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to pay the price. You worry that doing so will make it feel like a \u00e2\u0080\u009cbig company\u00e2\u0080\u009d. More so, you do not want your employees to be offended by the feedback, because you can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t afford to lose anyone right now. And people are happy, so why rock the boat? Why not take on a little management debt?</p>\n<p>The first noticeable payments will be due when somebody performs below expectations:</p>\n<blockquote><p>CEO: \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe was good when we hired him, what happened?\u00e2\u0080\u009d</p>\n<p>Manager: \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not doing the things that we need him to do.\u00e2\u0080\u009d</p>\n<p>CEO: \u00e2\u0080\u009cDid we clearly tell him that?\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br/>\nManager: \u00e2\u0080\u009cMaybe not clearly . . .\u00e2\u0080\u009d</p></blockquote>\n<p>However, the larger payment will be a silent tax. Companies execute well when everybody is on the same page and everybody is constantly improving. In a vacuum of feedback, there is almost no chance that your company will perform optimally across either dimension. Directions with no corrections will seem fuzzy and obtuse. People rarely improve weakness that they are unaware of. The ultimate price you will pay for not giving feedback: systematically crappy company performance.</p>\n<h2>In the end</h2>\n<p>Every really good, really experienced CEO that I know shares one important characteristic: they tend to opt for the hard answer to organizational issues. If faced with giving everyone the same bonus to make things easy or sharply rewarding performance and ruffling many feathers, they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll ruffle the feathers. If given the choice of cutting a popular project today, because it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not in the long-term plans or you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re keeping it around for morale purposes and to appear consistent, they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll cut it today. Why? Because they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve paid the price of management debt and they would rather not do that again.</p>\n<p><em>Special thanks to my friend Joanne Bradford who came up with the idea for this post and coined the term \u00e2\u0080\u009cmanagement debt\u00e2\u0080\u009d.</em></p>\n", "author": "Ben Horowitz"}, "149": {"podcast": "a16z Podcast: 10+1 Lessons from a Serial Entrepreneur | Andreessen...", "url": "https://a16z.com/2019/06/10/lessons-from-serial-entrepreneur-justin-kan/", "contents": "Want more a16z?

This is usually driven by the heady, very seductive idea that a partnership will accelerate credibility, sales, and minimum viable product (MVP) quickly and more easily than doing it yourself \u2014 by using another company\u2019s resources or by drafting on the traction of an existing platform. Those are very appealing propositions to a resource-strapped startup that is scrambling for a real, repeatable sign of product-market fit.</p>\n<p>The problem is, these technical partnerships rarely work if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re in an early or <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crossing_the_Chasm\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">\u201cpre-chasm\u201d market</a>. [By \u201ctechnical partnership\u201d, I mean specifically a partnership with a company whose primary business model is selling a tech product \u2014 in contrast to partnership with the channel whose primary business is reselling and value-added services around someone else\u00e2\u0080\u0099s product. Partnering with AWS, Google, Microsoft, Cisco, VMware, Salesforce and other products startups, for example, would all be technical partnerships, while VARs, resellers, consultants, integrators, and distributors are not.]</p>\n<p>Tech partnerships also have downsides that more often than not outweigh the good: in reality, they can require a tremendous amount of resources, give away your secrets, damage your relationship with your customers, commit you to onerous terms that may poison your company for future strategic relationships. I made this mistake many times and had to pay the full range of those consequences; I write this post from the position of extreme skepticism and paranoia exactly because partnerships are so appealing to first-time tech founders. So I hope in this post to cast a bit of shade \u2014 and hopefully save you time I wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t able to save myself.</p>\n<h5>Partnerships with other startups</h5>\n<p>Startups often try to use technical partnerships as a way of engaging the market before they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re really ready \u2014 or before the market is ready for them. The product may not be full-feature complete; the community is still small; or, most commonly, the go-to-market function is nonexistent or immature. At this point, founders often believe that one solution might be to find other startups to work with, in the hopes that a partnership will have a multiplicative effect (2\u00d72 = 4, yay!). Common proposals are to \u00e2\u0080\u009csupport each other\u2019s platforms\u00e2\u0080\u009d so that the total addressable market grows by allowing each startup access to the superset of customers being targeted by each alone.</p>\n<p>This almost never works. While there may be some nominal additive value of a joint effort, all of the things that make startups hard are amplified too \u2014 it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s risk, squared. A startup will do anything they need to to stay alive (as they should!). That means pivoting, entering adjacent markets, killing products, changing go-to-market models, open sourcing, changing deployment model, changing pricing model, and so on and so forth. A high likelihood of these kinds of changes are often the <em>only</em> thing you can rely on from a startup. These are often the dynamics that are actually multiplicative (.2 x .2 = 0.04 \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 oh shit!).</p>\n<blockquote class=\"pullquote\"><p>While there may be some nominal additive value of a joint effort, all of the things that make startups hard are amplified too \u2013 it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s risk, squared.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Amplified risk is only one of your problems. Even in the most benign case where massive changes don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t cause major misalignments, what happens more often than not is\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 nothing. One or both sides will expend resources and then drop the project as real business takes priority. On the other hand, when startups do manage to get some traction with customers, they will then sometimes turn on each other \u2014 for account control, for improved fractional revenue, or to blame the other party for product issues.</p>\n<p>There also tends to be an adverse-selection bias at play in all these situations. If a startup has the resources and time to partner with you, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a pretty good signal they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not at a dead run trying to keep up with market demand. In the early days of Nicira, we tried to partner with all the new OpenStack companies. Now, a decade later, only one of the nearly dozen remain, and they are the one we never had meaningful partnership discussions with. I guess they were busy building a business.</p>\n<h5>Partnerships with large companies</h5>\n<p>Startups partnering with startups tends to get obviously bad pretty quickly. Large companies, on the other hand, can appear to be exceptionally attractive partners. They often have formal partnership programs and an established brand \u2014 if they are market incumbents, they have a latent customer base just ready for innovation; if they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not, they have the resources to launch a large go-to-market effort. What\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not to love?</p>\n<p>But the hard truth is, large companies use partnerships solely to further their intensely self-interested goals. If those are ever at odds with the startup (which is often, particularly if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re successful and starting to affect customer behavior), the partnership will very quickly become a liability. Any knowledge shared, access given, or dependency created can now be used against you\u2026 and will be.</p>\n<p>Large companies are also savvy about who they partner with and why. The majority of their energy is focused on other large companies, where they are often locked into a competitive/cooperative d\u00c3\u00a9tente. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s rare that a large company will get much value from partnering with a startup. When they do, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s generally for optics \u2014 to uplift a new platform or product of their own: They\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be quite happy to add your logo to their slides and website, and they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re quite happy to have you on stage. This is actually perfectly rational behavior for them. A group of startups running around crowing about the partnership gives a large company a nice PR and marketing push; adding a host of logos creates a sense of momentum.</p>\n<p>However, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also important to remember that the history of our industry is littered with examples of large companies using their leverage to take advantage of small companies, even after an amicable partnership.</p>\n<p>A good mental model to use before entering a partnership is to assume \u2014 I<em>f what you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re doing is strategic, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll kick off a build vs. buy decision. If what you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re doing is not, it won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be prioritized </em><em>\u2014</em>\u00c2\u00a0and is therefore highly unlikely to be resourced sufficiently enough to get anything done. Either way, the outcome is not favorable for the startup. If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re lucky, you just waste resources, and there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no gain. If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not, you create a competitor with special access to your company.</p>\n<p>That said, sometimes partnerships are necessary, or even a good idea. At Nicira, for example, we couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t deploy without partnering with the various Linux distributions, the hypervisor vendors, and the cloud orchestrators. So, go into it knowing what to expect. Always assume that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>They\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll use the opportunity to learn from you.</li>\n<li>If they see a good opportunity to compete, they will.</li>\n<li>If you give them access to customers, they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll use it to drive their agenda.</li>\n<li>They\u00e2\u0080\u0099re exceptionally unlikely to concede a strategic control point or give you access to strategic accounts.</li>\n<li>They\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have no qualms killing your company by changing the terms of the partnership, or the technology or channels you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve come to rely on.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Remember, the \u201cmuscle memory\u201d of a large partnering organization is gained through complex (often competitive) relationships with other large companies. Smiling while they stab you is expected and practiced behavior.</p>\n<h5>Common partnership models</h5>\n<p>There are many potential forms of partnership between two tech companies. Below I cover the most common that we see between startups and larger companies \u2014 and highlight what to watch out for.</p>\n<h6>Platform integration<strong>\u00c2\u00a0</strong></h6>\n<p>You\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll often see a startup granted the \u00e2\u0080\u009cprivilege\u00e2\u0080\u009d of integrating with a larger company\u2019s platform through a structured, formal partnership program. This kind of partnership will often allow the startup access to otherwise restricted APIs, or documentation, or a distribution channel, like a package manager. Some platforms require this to interoperate and enforce that either technically (e.g., code signing) or contractually (e.g., voiding support if someone runs an unsupported extension). Others use partnerships primarily as marketing vehicles that are intended to be mutually beneficial to the platform as well as to the participants.</p>\n<p>Platform integration like this often looks desirable to the startup because it will both make their product look more mature, and (they believe) create a deeper, more meaningful relationship with a large company \u2014 leading to something like the large company actually selling the startup\u00e2\u0080\u0099s product. But platform risk is actually one of the single greatest risks a startup can take on.</p>\n<p>Large companies will always preserve the ability to monetize services they build on top of their platforms. Any \u00e2\u0080\u009cspecial\u00e2\u0080\u009d access you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re given can be revoked at any time. So not only are you educating them on how they might do that, if you are successful in creating an attractive market, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re almost ensuring they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll compete. History is so rife with examples like these, that they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve become hackneyed: Microsoft and the browser, Apple and music, Amazon and any number of AWS services. Remember, to a large company, giving something away for free in order to uplift a platform makes sense \u2014 even if it kills off a user of that platform. A very small multiplier on a very large number is still a large number.</p>\n<p>That said, there are many cases when platform integration is required and so is unavoidable. For example, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hard to sell datacenter software to the enterprise if you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t support Red Hat Enteprise Linux. In these cases, the obvious (but important!) integration rules apply \u2014 namely, stick to industry-standard interfaces, and always prefer public interfaces over private or restricted interfaces. This makes it much more difficult to revoke your access. And if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re lucky, you may get portability between different platforms as well.</p>\n<p>Finally, and most importantly, if you have to go down this path, the most powerful force to guide a partnership with a large company is customer pull. Line up as many customers as you can to ensure that the company you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re partnering with allocates the appropriate and necessary resources to your partnership, and that don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t jerk you around. I have had many experiences of large partners either refusing to partner, or requiring overly onerous terms, and then doing an about-face when one of their larger customers threatened not to renew unless they worked with us. In the end, customers always carry the largest sticks.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"pullquote\"><p>In the end, customers always carry the largest sticks.</p></blockquote>\n<h6>Marketplace participation</h6>\n<p>Another partnership opportunity startups find attractive is to list their product on the solutions marketplace\u00c2\u00a0of a larger company \u2014 the AWS Marketplace, the RedHat Ecosystem, the Cisco Marketplace, Google\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Cloud Launcher, etc. This is usually rationalized by the idea that it will increase sales velocity by funneling customers to your product. But that actually rarely happens in a <a href=\"https://a16z.com/2017/06/09/go-to-market-pre-chasm-market-martin-casado/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">market category-creation situation</a>. Your presence in marketplaces like these is simply not enough to educate a customer on the value of your solution. On the contrary, you may lose the enormously valuable opportunity to establish a direct relationship with the buyer.</p>\n<p>In an early market, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s very important that <em>you</em> drive the conversation with the customer, both to understand how they view the problem space, and to set the criteria by which you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re evaluated. Online markets can work against this because they constrain how you present your company because they are often built to enable lower-touch sales. An online market, for example, may define your competitive set based on how they organize the logos in the market \u2014 or force you into a simplistic pricing model just because you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re listed alongside other companies who post their pricing publicly.</p>\n<p>For early market enterprise companies, you should avoid participating in an online marketplace unless there is (a) an existing buying behavior in your target customer base that will buy through such a marketplace, or (b) marketplace participation is strictly required in order to operate on an important platform. The possible downside of entering an online market while you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re working to understand the market, set the industry discourse around your product, and work towards a scalable sales mode is far greater than the upside.</p>\n<h6><strong>Joint go-to-market (indirect)</strong></h6>\n<p>Indirect go-to-market here refers to a partnership in which you bundle or OEM your product to another product company, and let their sales force do the heavy lifting. Many startups view this as the ultimate coup: \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be like the Brocade or Intel and make billions without any sales force!\u00e2\u0080\u009d</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also a tremendously effective way to make your company irrelevant. In early markets, OEM and bundling relationships with existing products is an extremely effective mechanism of self sabotage. There are just so many ways it can go wrong:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You cannibalize your own market because generally you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have direct control of pricing.</li>\n<li>You can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t extract as much value as you deserve, because you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have the relationship to demonstrate the value (in early markets, often this involves deep technical discussions).</li>\n<li>With bundling, your product is far more likely to be shelfware, which means that you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re incredibly unlikely to get a renewal.</li>\n<li>You have no point of account control for upsell, expansion, or cross-sell.</li>\n<li>You have no brand stickiness, because the customer doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re powering the solution \u2014 and so you can easily be replaced by a lower cost solution once the market matures.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The message here is very clear: In early markets, particularly in deep tech, if you lose account control, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve lost your company. Of all the potential partnerships with other product companies, this one is the most dangerous. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s true that there are always exceptions to the rule, and some startups have pulled this off to phenomenal success (the early days of VMware being one notable example). But you should only do this if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re able to negotiate an exceptionally favorable deal that doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t lock you into one partner, and allows you to maintain direct sales. When Diane Greene set up the OEM strategy for VMware, she was able to get non-exclusive OEM relationships with Dell, HP, IBM, and Cisco. And she did this while building one of the best enterprise software sales teams ever seen in our industry. Almost no one else has been able to pull that off \u2014 and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s likely you won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t either.</p>\n<h6>Joint go-to-market (direct)</h6>\n<p>In a joint go-to-market partnership model, a startup will align its sales force with a larger product company. The basic idea is either for your product to be carried by their reps, but sold as an independent SKU (as opposed to the indirect method above), or for a joint selling motion where both of your sales teams are involved in an account. This model is attractive because it promises an increase in sales capacity and access to an existing customer base.</p>\n<p>Of all the partnership models, this is the one I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen work the best. Nicira (once acquired by VMWare) had a strong sales partnership with Palo Alto Networks, for example. But this model tends to be best suited for more mature market situations, and they certainly only work with real commitment from both sides. The majority of our joint direct go-to-market efforts failed; a number devolved into messy squabbles with the customer fighting for strategic control or wallet share, or finger-pointing over deployment issues.</p>\n<p>I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll say it again: Customers are the best method for guiding a partnership. A go-to-market partnership should be seen as a coordinated accelerant of an <em>already existing </em>synergy in the market, rather than an attempt to create one out of whole cloth. So you should only engage in a joint direct sales effort with a larger company if you believe that you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve established<em> a scalable, repeatable sale independently, </em>and if you have enough experience in the field to know that your product naturally aligns with your partner-to-be\u2019s product.</p>\n<p>You also will want to make sure that a) your partner is sufficiently committed to the partnership, and b) their sales team will actually help you. Generally this means that there is some incentive for their team to bring you into a deal and get the deal closed. There are many mechanisms for doing this. The most common is giving SPIFs (sales performance incentive funds, a financial incentive) to your partner\u2019s sales team for bringing you into a deal, or helping sell your product. Getting the other company to commit to a product-specific quota on your product is even more effective.</p>\n<p>Partnerships are won and lost in the field. Behavior will always follow business, and will be dependent on whether your partners are making money by partnering with you. I believe one of the many reasons VMWare was so successful was that for every dollar VMware made, the partner ecosystem made eight. That said, no amount of will, structure, or effort will create product-market fit if none exists. And no amount of business development meetings and executive assurances will create a friendly relationship if there is naturally a competitive element in the field. So it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s important to only use joint go-to-market with a partner to accelerate a product synergy that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s already been demonstrated organically in the field \u2014 and not try to create one.</p>\n<p>*\u00c2\u00a0 \u00c2\u00a0*\u00c2\u00a0 \u00c2\u00a0*</p>\n<p>Tech partnerships are so common \u2014 and such a ubiquitous false step \u2014 precisely because they are so seductive at first glance. Of course, partnerships do work at times. And if executed carefully, they <em>can</em> be a boon to both sides, so it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s worth entertaining partnering discussions. In the end, though, use the natural pull of the market to guide your partnership strategy, watch your back, and ensure you have practical expectations as to the actual benefits. Otherwise, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have effectively sold your company without collecting payment \u2014 and expended a lot of resources to do it.</p>\n", "author": "Martin Casado"}, "159": {"podcast": "Portfolio | Andreessen Horowitz", "url": "https://a16z.com/portfolio/", "contents": "Podcasts.

How many did you scroll through and glaze over? What if the number was capped at 2 or 3 a day? How would that change how you felt about the platform? Similarly, think about how many subscriptions you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve signed up for\u00e2\u0080\u0094or forgot to cancel. What if, at the point of purchase, you had the option to only buy what you wanted, for the time frame you specified? This type of consumer power is the reality for netizens in China today\u00e2\u0080\u0094because Chinese internet companies have adopted business models that are drastically different than what we see here in the States, especially on mobile.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Product success is not just about having a good product, but also having the right business model(s). Expanding sources of revenue pushes us to think beyond what we know, and creates the infrastructure that opens up new opportunities. In this post, I will use consumer entertainment apps (books, podcasts, videos, and music) as a lens into the different business models and product strategies of Chinese companies. Thinking about content consumption in a mobile-first way in China has enabled these new business models, which not only provide diversified revenue streams for businesses, but also allow users to make better, more flexible purchasing decisions. </span></p>\n<h1><span style=\"font-weight:400\">State of Affairs in the US</span></h1>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">In the last decade, large consumer Internet companies from Google and Pinterest to Lyft and Spotify have become household names with market caps in the hundreds of billions of dollars. And yet, in terms of how these hugely successful companies monetize, these companies\u00e2\u0080\u0099 revenue streams are interestingly not very diverse. In fact, they generally fall into one of two buckets: advertising-driven, or transaction/subscription-driven. Revenue is heavily concentrated in one of these two business models, which in turn drives how the companies think about creating product. For example, advertising-driven companies focus on increasing engagement and time in app; transaction-driven services optimize for the lowest friction before checkout.</span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/connie-image-1.png?ssl=1\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-283895 aligncenter\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"331\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/connie-image-1.png?resize=588%2C331&amp;ssl=1\" width=\"588\"/></a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Put simply, apps in the United States are part of either the eyeball economy or part of the wallet economy.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/connie-image-2.png?ssl=1\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-283894\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"330\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/connie-image-2.png?resize=588%2C330&amp;ssl=1\" width=\"588\"/></a></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s great for a company to focus, but is such a singular focus on one model for a revenue stream the best long term strategy for growth? And perhaps more importantly, does this lead to the best product for customers? </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">There are extremely compelling reasons to consider diversified revenue streams. Expanding revenue beyond ads allows for the simple fact that people\u00e2\u0080\u0099s preferences change. Digital marketing experts estimate that Americans are exposed to around </span><a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesagencycouncil/2017/08/25/finding-brand-success-in-the-digital-world/\"><span style=\"font-weight:400\">4,000 to 10,000</span></a><span style=\"font-weight:400\"> ads daily. There is a point where you can no longer stuff more ads down a consumer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s throat; ads become less effective and more annoying. Over time consumers may also not feel comfortable always being forced to pay for a \u00e2\u0080\u0098buffet\u00e2\u0080\u0099 with subscriptions, when in fact they only want one item on the menu. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">There are also very strong reasons for combining the advertising centric world and the transaction world. Imagine if, as an advertising company, all of your ads could become one-click transactions: a win-win for advertisers, users, and the platform. If you are a transaction or subscription company, adding content and finding ways for users to increase time on your site leads to more mindshare and lower customer acquisition costs when expanding business lines.</span></p>\n<h1><span style=\"font-weight:400\">What do these new business models look like?</span></h1>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Largely because many people could not afford a computer, China skipped the PC and the credit card; smartphones were the way many people were exposed to the Internet for the first time. So today, products aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t just mobile </span><i><span style=\"font-weight:400\">first</span></i><span style=\"font-weight:400\">, many are mobile </span><i><span style=\"font-weight:400\">only</span></i><span style=\"font-weight:400\">. Mobile payments have penetrated the country and China has become a seamless digital society. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">In part because a mobile ad is much more annoying on a small screen, the emphasis on advertising vs. other revenue streams is very different in China today than it is in the US. Due to the heightened competitive environment in China, platforms can not afford to not simultaneously seek alternative revenue streams and find ways to monetize without harming the user experience. Take Tencent, for example \u2014 a consumer internet company with skyrocketing revenue and a very diversified revenue stream \u2014 cloud/payments revenue is up 105% YOY; value added services for social networks are growing by 47%; and less than 20% of their revenue is from advertising. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe should not be overloading our users with ads,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Tencent President Martin Lau in the Q1 earning call last year. As a result, ads in WeChat Moments (the equivalent to the FB newsfeed) are limited to just two per day. Tencent is able to hold that line on user experience because it has other ways of monetization. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hard to argue that the end result is not a better user experience. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/connie-image-3.png?ssl=1\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-283893\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"315\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/connie-image-3.png?resize=558%2C315&amp;ssl=1\" width=\"558\"/></a></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">As the products have got more sophisticated on mobile, business models with diversified revenue streams for content consumption \u2014 that rely neither solely on advertising nor transactions \u2014 evolved as well. This post will address four different content categories, with different consumer app sectors as case studies that illustrate not only how different the business models are, but also how the business models result in unique and ultimately better consumer experiences.</span></p>\n<h1><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Books</span></h1>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">In the United States, we typically buy digital books on Amazon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s website as one of several purchase options, in the same checkout flow as ordinary purchases.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/connie-image-4.png?ssl=1\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-283892\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"312\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/connie-image-4.png?resize=558%2C312&amp;ssl=1\" width=\"558\"/></a></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">In China, books are consumed very differently. In addition to their paid subscription service (similar to Kindle Unlimited), there are three main business models for book-selling in QQ Reading:</span></p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight:400\"><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Paid books allow readers access of up to \u00e2\u0085\u0094 of the book for free. Readers have time to get hooked before they need to pay to unlock the ending. Think about how many more books you\u00e2\u0080\u0099d start if this were the case in the States!</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight:400\"><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Books are also sold as bite-sized snacks. Readers pay per 1,000 words, for often-serialized works. Below is a screenshot of one of the most popular books from 2014, \u00e4\u00b8\u0080\u00e4\u00b8\u0096\u00e5\u0080\u00be\u00e5\u009f\u008e.

Because authors can publish chapters piecemeal, they are also able to incorporate reader feedback to quickly change plots or even kill off characters.<br/>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight:400\"><br/>\n<a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/connie-image-5.png?ssl=1\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-283891 aligncenter\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"512\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/connie-image-5.png?resize=250%2C512&amp;ssl=1\" width=\"250\"/></a></span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight:400;text-align:left\">Some authors offer free books and illustrations, gain a loyal user base, and then collect money through tips.

In WeRead, another one of China Literature\u00e2\u0080\u0099s reading apps, users compete against their WeChat friends on a weekly leaderboard showing who has read for the most time. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not just for bragging rights; users earn credits for every 30 minutes they read to spend on more books. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Search is also a much more complex and refined function in China, going far beyond best-sellers or sort-by-categories with granular, multivariable, smarter search options. Search is about discovery, after all \u2014 and the Chinese book platforms find ways to convey more information to customers, so they can find precisely what they want to read however they want to pay for it. For example, users can filter according to male or female readership, physical publications, or audiobooks. Then users can view custom curated lists including top trending, top new, top annual, most searches, free books with the most tips, and even according to times read cover-to-cover. These lists can be sorted weekly, monthly, or overall. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Importantly, in China, these book platforms also combine books from big publishers with books from up and coming self-published authors. So the way books are sold in China compared to the US is a major rethink of the publishing industry as well as a rethink of ebook platforms. In China, purchasing books is not about a one-time transaction for the platforms. There are elements of social media, gamification, and enhanced discovery \u2014 ultimately creating an experience that drives more sales. It all seems to be working. In China the ebook industry grew over </span><a href=\"http://www.iresearchchina.com/content/details7_44163.html\"><span style=\"font-weight:400\">35%</span></a><span style=\"font-weight:400\"> from 2016 to 2017; the same industry in the same time in the US trended the opposite direction. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/connie-image-7.png?ssl=1\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-283889\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"315\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/connie-image-7.png?resize=558%2C315&amp;ssl=1\" width=\"558\"/></a></span></p>\n<h1><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Podcasts</span></h1>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">The podcast Serial was downloaded </span><a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2014/12/18/showbiz/feat-serial-podcast-btn/index.html\"><span style=\"font-weight:400\">40 million times</span></a><span style=\"font-weight:400\"> during its first three-month season in October 2014. This wildly successful spin-off of </span><i><span style=\"font-weight:400\">This is American Life</span></i><span style=\"font-weight:400\"> likely perhaps earned up to one million dollars in ad revenue, according to the industry standard of </span><a href=\"https://money.cnn.com/2014/12/04/media/serial-podcast/index.html\"><span style=\"font-weight:400\">$25</span></a><span style=\"font-weight:400\"> per 1,000 downloads. Revenue might even have been lower, as rates were negotiated well before anyone knew how successful the podcast would become. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Despite being deemed </span><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/24/business/media/serial-podcastings-first-breakout-hit-sets-stage-for-more.html\"><span style=\"font-weight:400\">\u00e2\u0080\u0098podcasting\u00e2\u0080\u0099s first breakout hit\u00e2\u0080\u0099</span></a><span style=\"font-weight:400\">, revenue couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t cover the cost of producing a second season. The host/executive producer Sarah Koenig started asking listeners for </span><a href=\"https://medium.com/@tylersmoody/why-does-serial-need-donations-82d3df728b20\"><span style=\"font-weight:400\">donations</span></a><span style=\"font-weight:400\"> during episode nine. In less than a week, enough donations poured in to guarantee a sequel, but the fact remains that advertising alone couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t support the big budget podcasts\u00e2\u0080\u0099 continued production even for the most successful podcast the US had ever seen.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">The entire podcast market in the US in 2017 was </span><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/06/11/u-s-podcast-ad-revenues-hit-record-314-million-in-2017/\"><span style=\"font-weight:400\">$314 million</span></a><span style=\"font-weight:400\">, all from ads. Estimates for paid podcast in China, on the other hand, are </span><a href=\"https://www.marketplace.org/2018/09/13/world/fomo-china-7-billion-industry\"><span style=\"font-weight:400\">$3-5 billion</span></a><span style=\"font-weight:400\">, and many individual podcasters are multimillionaires. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not a difference of talent; it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a difference in business models.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/connie-image-8.png?ssl=1\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-283888\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"316\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/connie-image-8.png?resize=558%2C316&amp;ssl=1\" width=\"558\"/></a></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\"><br/>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight:400\">In China, many podcasts charge the end customer instead of relying solely on advertising. Some podcasts are part of the platform\u00e2\u0080\u0099s paid subscription service, but users always have the option to pay for podcasts individually. The following screenshot from the popular podcasting app Ximalaya is all about improving the sound of users\u00e2\u0080\u0099 voices. The podcast course is made of over 30 episodes, and costs around $17. The course has over fifteen million listens and has generated over </span><a href=\"https://m.pedaily.cn/news/415030\"><span style=\"font-weight:400\">$1 million</span></a><span style=\"font-weight:400\"> in revenue.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/connie-image-9.png?ssl=1\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-283887\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"511\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/connie-image-9.png?resize=250%2C511&amp;ssl=1\" width=\"250\"/></a></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Just like digital books, free podcasts are monetized in several ways. Some podcasts rely on sponsorships and ads the way we do in the US, but podcast hosts can also receive tips that are split between podcaster and platform. In the following example, tip options vary from $.30 to $21. This new model means everyone can make money and content creators have more funds to invest in better production and better content; everyone wins.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/connie-image-10.png?ssl=1\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-283886\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"511\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/connie-image-10.png?resize=250%2C511&amp;ssl=1\" width=\"250\"/></a></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">The audio platform Dedao (\u00e2\u0080\u009ciGetGet\u00e2\u0080\u009d) essentially takes the MOOC format and applies it to podcasts. Below are two economics professors from Peking University. Xue Zhaofeng, the professor on the left, actually resigned after making </span><a href=\"https://www.scmp.com/news/china/society/article/2137366/meet-professor-who-turned-his-back-one-chinas-top-universities\"><span style=\"font-weight:400\">$8 million</span></a><span style=\"font-weight:400\"> in one year with his economics podcast series. The professor on the right has grossed nearly $5M in sales for her podcasts on financial literacy and wealth management techniques.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/connie-image-11.png?ssl=1\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-283885\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"315\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/connie-image-11.png?resize=558%2C315&amp;ssl=1\" width=\"558\"/></a><br/>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Beyond the scale and business models, what else makes these Chinese podcast platforms different from their Western counterparts? Similar to book platforms, these apps hook users through social elements and gamification. Ximalaya has a leveling concept, where you \u00e2\u0080\u0098level up\u00e2\u0080\u0099 by listening or spending money in the app to earn coupons and even limited-time membership to use their paid subscription service. Dedao hosts a social network based around studying, where users can create a public profile and share or compare course notes. Users can also leave public questions or comments at the end of each podcast transcript.</span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/connie-image-12.png?ssl=1\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-283884\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"512\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/connie-image-12.png?resize=250%2C512&amp;ssl=1\" width=\"250\"/></a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Studying podcast platforms such as Dedao or Ximalaya give us insight to how the podcast market here in the States can evolve beyond ads, and ultimately put more money in the pockets of our podcast creators. There is an expansive expert network that is untapped and not fully monetized in the States, not due to a lack of talent, but because of overly simplistic business models. </span></p>\n<h1><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Video</span></h1>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">In the U.S., this is what users typically see on YouTube when they first click on a video. Monetization is accomplished through pre-roll ads, display ads, and interstitial ads. Ads typically have nothing to do with the content of the video.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/connie-image-13.png?ssl=1\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-283883\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"316\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/connie-image-13.png?resize=558%2C316&amp;ssl=1\" width=\"558\"/></a></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">In China, Baidu spinoff iQiyi, one of the bigger video players, uses AI and machine learning to figure out what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s happening in the content, and play </span><i><span style=\"font-weight:400\">relevant</span></i><span style=\"font-weight:400\"> advertising. In the following scene of a young professional putting on lipstick, for example, iQiyi serves an ad promoting a makeup brand. This makes product placement ads that much more valuable, and ads in general slightly more acceptable (screenshot from </span><a href=\"http://www.adhome520.com/home/article/detail/id/886.html\"><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Ad+ Home</span></a><span style=\"font-weight:400\">).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/connie-image-14.png?ssl=1\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-283882\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"381\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/connie-image-14.png?resize=668%2C381&amp;ssl=1\" width=\"668\"/></a></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">iQiyi\u00e2\u0080\u0099s business model also goes beyond advertising with many other revenue initiatives. (Sneak peak: advertising is less than 50% of the company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s revenue). iQiyi has over 80 million VIP members, but membership is not an absolute paywall. Instead, members get perks such as discount coupons, no advertisements, and the ability to watch new releases up to 12 episodes faster. Some of the movies on iQiyi are member-exclusives; non-members can watch the first 6 minutes of the film before deciding whether or not to \u00e2\u0080\u009cunlock\u00e2\u0080\u009d the rest of it with a membership or pay \u00c3\u00a0 la carte for the movie. VIP membership rewards active users with perks that keep them engaged with the platform and inevitably spend more money.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">VIP memberships also include exclusive access to app skins based on celebrities or popular shows. In the below skin from iQiyi-produced \u00e2\u0080\u0098Sing! China\u00e2\u0080\u0099, all of the navigation buttons are replaced with faces of the mentors/judges.</span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/connie-image-15.png?ssl=1\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-283881\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"512\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/connie-image-15.png?resize=250%2C512&amp;ssl=1\" width=\"250\"/></a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">On iQiyi, users can clip digital coupons, such as the following BOGO coupons for Dairy Queen and Burger King. Imagine watching a movie on YouTube and getting a craving for pizza and hot wings, now you can immediately act on that craving.</span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/connie-image-16.png?ssl=1\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-283880\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"512\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/connie-image-16.png?resize=250%2C512&amp;ssl=1\" width=\"250\"/></a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">This is what the watch screen on iQiyi looks like. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s live comments, sharing for prizes, GIF creation, and even the ability to top up your mobile data plan. Users are even upsold their VIP membership in order to access the higher quality audio and video. You could say this is too crowded of a page; you could also argue that this is a more advanced experience, where you can even create content to share on social media. If it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s too busy for you, all you have to do is tap to hide the settings overlay.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/connie-image-17.png?ssl=1\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-283879\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"273\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/connie-image-17.png?resize=558%2C273&amp;ssl=1\" width=\"558\"/></a></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">For many shows or movies, users can shop related items as they continue to watch; there is no need to stop the video. Rap of China viewers can buy Beats headsets as they watch, while users watching \u00e2\u0080\u0098The Great Wall\u00e2\u0080\u0099 movie can purchase custom movie merchandise while they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re engrossed in the film.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s even a social network component that lives entirely inside iQiyi. Users can join their favorite celebrities fan circles to chat about the latest celebrity news and gossip. The platform is a rich aggregate of content and can be used as a portal to watch shows, movies, social media, view upcoming meet and greet events, and even read news.</span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/connie-image-18.png?ssl=1\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-283878\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"512\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/connie-image-18.png?resize=250%2C512&amp;ssl=1\" width=\"250\"/></a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">This social network that lives inside iQiyi is not just for celebrity news; there are more than one hundred fan circles based on iQiyi\u00e2\u0080\u0099s most popular content and all topics related to entertainment. In turn, the information from the social network gives iQiyi data on how to cast characters, evaluate scripts, and even predict </span><a href=\"https://www.scmp.com/tech/article/2161486/how-big-data-helped-chinas-netflix-iqiyi-decide-back-summer-blockbuster-about\"><span style=\"font-weight:400\">show success.</span></a><span style=\"font-weight:400\"> The </span><a href=\"http://www.xinhuanet.com/fortune/2017-11/22/c_129747284.htm\"><span style=\"font-weight:400\">social network</span></a><span style=\"font-weight:400\"> increases app opens by 160%, and average daily watch time by 24%.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">iQiyi\u00e2\u0080\u0099s business model has also extended to the real world with its recent launch of \u00e2\u0080\u0098on-demand movie theatres.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 These miniature </span><a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/chinas-iqiyi-launches-demand-movie-theater-business-1113855\"><span style=\"font-weight:400\">theatres</span></a><span style=\"font-weight:400\"> range from two to ten seats, and are rentable by the hour to watch any content from iQiyi\u00e2\u0080\u0099s library. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s bringing the traditional movie theatre experience up to date in the era of streaming.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">The result of iQiyi\u00e2\u0080\u0099s expansive business model is a diverse product strategy and diverse revenue streams.The below graph depicts the 1H18 revenue distribution, with membership and advertising in a dead heat. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/connie-image-19.png?ssl=1\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-283877\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"315\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/connie-image-19.png?resize=558%2C315&amp;ssl=1\" width=\"558\"/></a></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">However, this race did not stay even for long. </span><a href=\"http://media.corporate-ir.net/media_files/IROL/25/254698/2018/Press_Releases_Investor_Relations_iQIYI.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight:400\">In 3Q18</span></a><span style=\"font-weight:400\">, membership stayed steady at 41.2% of revenue, while advertising dropped to 34.6%. \u00c2\u00a0iQiyi has over 80 million paying members out of over 500 million total users, and is able to successfully monetize </span><i><span style=\"font-weight:400\">all</span></i><span style=\"font-weight:400\"> users because of its expansive business model and emphasis on diversified revenue.</span></p>\n<h1><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Music</span></h1>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">In the US, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re used to a monthly subscription fee on Spotify or free online radio where we listen to ads every so often. What happens when you take a music streaming platform and turn it into a social, lifestyle app? </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Tencent Music illustrates very well the extent to which Chinese music industry has rethought the entire business model. For starters, popular artists often have a limited-time streaming block on new releases. During this time period, users buy or gift virtual albums that provide exclusive access. Two years ago, pop singer Jay Chou sold limited time access to his album Bedtime Stories for less than $3. To promote competition among fans, Tencent Music created a leaderboard showing how many times fans purchased the album; the top user purchased the album over 400 times!</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/connie-image-20.png?ssl=1\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-283876\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"520\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/connie-image-20.png?resize=254%2C520&amp;ssl=1\" width=\"254\"/></a></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">But you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have to top the leaderboards to get the benefits here. Say you bought that Jay Chou album 3 times; you might be ranked #3913 on the leaderboard, but worry not, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve also won 3 raffle tickets to win signed posters, VIP memberships, or even Jay Chou sleeping masks. This kind of gamification and reward system turns average fans into superfans, and gives superfans a deeper connection to the artists they adore.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/connie-image-21.png?ssl=1\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-283875\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"450\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/connie-image-21.png?resize=350%2C450&amp;ssl=1\" width=\"350\"/></a></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">The Tencent Music platform has multiple such methods of increasing fan loyalty and improving artist marketing for artists big and small. Similar to iQiyi, users can skin the app for a small fee. You can imagine how many Deadheads, Beliebers or Swifties here in the States might also be willing to pay a small fee to skin their media apps. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">There is also a social network where small or medium artists can post articles, and fans can access news, music videos, and behind the scenes content. Artists are able to share more of their story and fans develop deeper loyalty. Artists simply don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get this kind of fan support from Western music platforms. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">If your interest is in live music, Tencent Music apps also have a feature for that. The app strives to be a hub for concerts and events so you can buy concert tickets directly within the app. If you can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t attend concerts in person, you can also watch live streams. In the screenshot below, the live stream concert by TFBOYS was watched over 36 million times. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/connie-image-22.png?ssl=1\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-283874\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"512\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/connie-image-22.png?resize=250%2C512&amp;ssl=1\" width=\"250\"/></a></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">In Tencent Music, there are leaderboards for gamification, social radio and singing, live concerts, and even a TMZ-type portal for discovery. In short, there are </span><i><span style=\"font-weight:400\">many</span></i><span style=\"font-weight:400\"> ways for listeners to engage with music and the artists. But perhaps the biggest difference of all is that the company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s focus is not just listening and consuming music, but also creating content and allowing users to earn money. Anyone can create an online radio station within the music app and curate their own playlist. Hosts tell stories between songs, or give commentary on the lyrics.

Singers keep </span><a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-tencentmusic-ipo/tencent-music-bound-for-u-s-ipo-profits-from-social-savvy-idUSKCN1M718Y\"><span style=\"font-weight:400\">30%</span></a><span style=\"font-weight:400\"> of the tip revenue. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fun, social, and makes a lot of money for both platform and customer.</span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/connie-image-24.png?ssl=1\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-283872\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"512\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/connie-image-24.png?resize=250%2C512&amp;ssl=1\" width=\"250\"/></a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Lastly, Tencent Music is also taking its business offline. The company is not only selling microphones and headphones, but also opening up hundreds of mini karaoke booths in malls. They come complete with chairs, curtains, headsets, even air conditioning. Users have a blast in the booth, and then get a recording of the singing sent to their phone. (Image below of competitor Minik\u00e2\u0080\u0099s karaoke booth from </span><a href=\"https://www.limitlessiq.com/news/post/view/id/3138/\"><span style=\"font-weight:400\">journalist Zhang Cenyu</span></a><span style=\"font-weight:400\">). </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/connie-image-25.png?ssl=1\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-283871\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"415\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/connie-image-25.png?resize=558%2C415&amp;ssl=1\" width=\"558\"/></a></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">The result of such a nuanced business model is a whopping 70% of revenue comes from those live streaming services \u2013 tips for radio and karaoke. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a complete contrast from Spotify\u00e2\u0080\u0099s business model, of which 90% of revenue comes from subscriptions. All in all, Tencent Music\u00e2\u0080\u0099s business model transforms music from a solo consumption product to a lifestyle, sharable experience.</span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/37-tencent-entertainment-1h18-revenue.png?ssl=1\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-284212 aligncenter\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"326\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/37-tencent-entertainment-1h18-revenue.png?resize=582%2C326&amp;ssl=1\" width=\"582\"/></a></p>\n<h1><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Where is the US headed?</span></h1>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Finding new ways to diversify revenue streams in China has led to very interesting product innovation for these companies. We are just beginning to see the same kind of thinking in the US. Amazon is one of my favorite examples. </span><span style=\"font-weight:400\">As Amazon dives more into content and advertisements, its ability to sell ads against viewer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s past purchases make their ads tremendously valuable.

Jonah predicted that by 2019, </span><a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/jonah/9-boxes?utm_term=.dbk46Qwok#.sr1zn7a83\"><span style=\"font-weight:400\">half</span></a><span style=\"font-weight:400\"> of the company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s revenue will come from outside of ads.</span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/connie-image-31.png?ssl=1\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-283865\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"335\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/connie-image-31.png?resize=558%2C335&amp;ssl=1\" width=\"558\"/></a></p>\n<h1><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Going beyond \u201conly\u201d</span></h1>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">In the past, revenue was often thought of as a result of product brilliance. Studying China illustrates how </span><i><span style=\"font-weight:400\">expanding</span></i><span style=\"font-weight:400\"> sources of revenue, not just growing existing revenue lines, is a lens to </span><i><span style=\"font-weight:400\">drive</span></i><span style=\"font-weight:400\"> product thinking. This idea of going beyond ads-only and transactions-only to diversify revenue streams can be applied to all kinds of sectors. Just think about some of the following ways in which we can adapt or integrate business models for the future: ads to subsidize ride sharing; live streaming, influencer reviews, and limited-time promos to drive e-commerce; gamification to promote healthier lifestyles. How much more fun could products and services be if they branched away from a singular business model?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">History has taught us that not all established companies can make business model transitions. Will the current set of Internet companies make this leap to more personalized user experiences that are less ad- or transaction-centric? Perhaps, given all of this, FAANG could be more vulnerable than many think. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Expanding sources of revenue not only pushes us to think beyond what we know, but forces us to create the infrastructure to go after new opportunities. After all, revenue is simply a proxy for how you are serving your customers. As you diversify and experiment in generating revenue in new ways, you are effectively honing in on your ability to give customers what they want, how they want it. </span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/45-product-revenue-gif.gif?ssl=1\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-284215\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"314\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/45-product-revenue-gif.gif?resize=558%2C314&amp;ssl=1\" width=\"558\"/></a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Business models as a product strategy.

In the present moment, that attention has only grown for both public and private companies. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve observed a bifurcation in the market of \u00e2\u0080\u009chaves\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009chave nots\u00e2\u0080\u009d: those companies that have high gross margins are worthy of investor attention, but those that do not are quickly dismissed.\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Of course, the focus on gross margins is understandable. A high gross margin is a preferred business feature. Higher gross margins allow for more percentage points of revenue to be spent on growth and product development. Higher gross margins also tend to translate to higher cash flow margin, and in a world where \u00e2\u0080\u009chow much runway do you have\u00e2\u0080\u009d has become a (if not, the) preeminent question, cash is paramount. For these reasons, high gross margin companies typically have higher revenue multiples than their low gross margin counterparts.\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">But we risk losing sight of what truly drives business value. Yes, gross margins are important. But over-rotating on gross margins is myopic because business quality is driven by more than margins.\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Business quality is about </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">defensibility</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. Defensibility comes from </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">moats</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. And while high gross margins are often a reflection of moats, they are not a moat in and of themselves. And when faced with a low gross margin business, you need to focus even more on moats: without those extra points of revenue to invest in sales &amp; marketing strategies or research &amp; development, you need other ways to generate cash flow over time.</span></p>\n<div class=\"widget widget--subscribe widget--subscribe-inline widget--subscribe-theme-default\" data-subscribe-instance=\"2\">\n<div id=\"widget-signup-form-2\">\n<h3 class=\"widget__title\"><span>Want more a16z?</span></h3>\n<p>Sign up to get our best articles, latest podcasts, and news on our investments emailed to you.</p>\n<div class=\"input-wrap\">\n<form class=\"mktoForm\" data-formid=\"1560\" data-forminstance=\"subscribe-inline-content-2\" data-thankyou-container=\"#widget-signup-form-2\" data-thankyou-message=\"#widget-signup-ty-2\" id=\"mktoForm-1560\" target=\"_blank\"></form>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"thankyou-message\" id=\"widget-signup-ty-2\" style=\"display: none\">\n<div class=\"thankyou-message-inner\">\n<h4>Thanks for signing up.</h4>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The markets will show you that companies with low gross margins can still be highly cash flow generative and highly defensible, and thus highly valuable. One of the highest valued companies in a major exchange, Apple, </span><a href=\"https://www.apple.com/newsroom/pdfs/FY20_Q2_Consolidated_Financial_Statements.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">has a 38% gross margin</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, roughly half of that for many software businesses! In fact, many of the most valuable companies have low gross margins (as shown by Capital IQ, as of May 27, 2020): from Walmart and Home Depot to Disney and Netflix to Nike and Starbucks to Raytheon and Lockheed Martin. We believe the next generation of iconic companies like these will be more tech-enabled, but still likely have gross margins that are well below those seen in traditional software.</span></p>\n<span class=\"bctt-click-to-tweet\"><span class=\"bctt-ctt-text\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https://a16z.com/2020/05/28/moats-before-gross-margins/&amp;text=Over-rotating%20on%20gross%20margins%20is%20myopic.%20Why%3F%20Business%20quality%20is%20about%20defensibility.%20Defensibility%20comes%20from%20moats.%20And%20while%20high%20gross%20margins%20are%20often%20a%20reflection%20of%20moats%2C%20they%20are%20not%20a%20moat%20themselves%2C%20say%20%40DavidGeorge83%20%26%20%40aleximm&amp;related\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Over-rotating on gross margins is myopic.

For all entrepreneurs (but especially those building a low gross margins business), here are four examples of moats, as well as some metrics we look for that demonstrate the presence of that moat.</span></p>\n<h3>Economies of scale</h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Economies of scale refers to a cost advantage resulting from increased production. One of the most prominent examples in tech is Amazon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s distribution network, but they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not the only one. For example, the scale of Carvana\u00e2\u0080\u0099s refurbishment network enables the company to care for vehicles at a lower cost than competitors.\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The simplest question for whether economies of scale are achieved is: are your per unit costs defensibly lower than your competitors\u00e2\u0080\u0099? It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s super-rare for early and growth stage startups to achieve such scale; assuming yours are not, the next question is: </span><b>are your per unit costs improving while not degrading your unit economics</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">? For example, you could push paid advertising to lead to high volume and scale benefits, but that paid advertising may be so excessive that your unit economics become unprofitable.\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Another sign of emerging economies of scale is if your business has a </span><b>clear pathway to negotiating power</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> over your suppliers and/or buyers. Again, Amazon is the classic example, but another interesting possibility is Spotify. Historically, music labels have commanded certain economics from streaming services, but if Spotify\u00e2\u0080\u0099s existing large user base continues to gain share, the negotiation could flip, allowing Spotify to achieve meaningfully differentiated economics relative to the competition.</span></p>\n<h3>Meaningfully differentiated technology</h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Most companies believe they have differentiated technology, and many do. Features, integrations, reportability \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 the list goes on. But when entrepreneurs look to distinguish their technology enough to make it a true moat, they should be focused on differentiating their product and service in a way that matters. Doing so enables companies to charge more (\u00e2\u0080\u009cpremium\u00e2\u0080\u009d pricing) and spend less on sales &amp; marketing (the product \u00e2\u0080\u009csells itself\u00e2\u0080\u009d). Moreover, customer lock-in can be higher because there is a perceived switching cost of moving to an inferior tech solution.\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no one clear metric that indicates this moat across all cases, but we tend to see it pop up in a few ways. One example is if your company has </span><b>intellectual property</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> (e.g. patents) that can protect your advantage for many years to come. In the absence of IP, the clearest measure of differentiated technology is </span><b>pricing power</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. Are customers willing to pay a higher price for your product than others? If so, you are likely selling a differentiated offering.\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Another way we get at this question is talking to customers. If asked, do your customers claim no one else can match your offering today, and that they would be willing to pay a higher price? Do they say that no one else on the market has the capacity to continue building the way you do? Government officials</span><a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/17/how-andurils-palmer-luckey-plans-to-take-on-boeing-lockheed-martin.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> select</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> Anduril because its sensor fusion and machine vision platform is unlike the offerings of other defense contractors who are also unlikely to be able to recruit and retain talent capable of building similar technology in the coming years.</span></p>\n<h3>Network effects</h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no secret that we at a16z love </span><a href=\"https://a16z.com/advice-and-how-to/network-effects/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">network effects</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, especially when it comes to </span><a href=\"https://a16z.com/marketplace-100/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">marketplaces</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. Network effects happen when a product or service becomes more valuable to its users as more people use it, creating a flywheel effect on growth. Despite having low gross margins, many public company internet marketplaces, such as Lyft and Uber, have leveraged network effects to drive organic growth, increase switching costs, and build scaled businesses.\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">We have published a lot about the metrics for and common leading indicators of network effects (to start, try </span><a href=\"https://a16z.com/2016/03/07/all-about-network-effects/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">here</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, </span><a href=\"https://a16z.com/2018/12/13/16-metrics-network-effects/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">here</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, and </span><a href=\"https://a16z.com/2018/12/13/network-effects-dynamics-in-practice/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">here</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">), but there are a few rules of thumb for determining if you have network effects. One is measuring engagement: does </span><b>engagement (e.g., DAU/MAU) improve</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> as the number of users grows? Another way is to look at monetization: are you experiencing </span><b>organic growth in wallet share for supply and demand</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">? Across the many grocery and restaurant delivery startups, we\u2019ve observed higher consumer engagement and dollar retention in denser markets. Ideally, for companies exhibiting network effects, we see increasing returns to engagement (e.g., revenue grows exponentially relative to time within a single metro).</span></p>\n<h3>Direct brand power</h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">One way to combat having fewer percentage points of revenue to spend on strategies like outbound sales and paid marketing is to have built a killer brand. A strong brand commands word-of-mouth referrals, a cult following, and direct traffic. Those with LaCroix, Hint Water and increasingly Bevi in their office know that word spreads fast, and soon every office kitchen must have them in stock.\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Building a brand takes time and focus (and money!), but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ultimately valuable and can pay off well into the future. How do you know if you have a powerful brand? One metric we look for is </span><b>increasing organic and direct traffic</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">: do you have an increasing percentage of your traffic and revenue coming from organic or direct channels (vs. paid) over time? Leveraging unpaid channels can help ensure you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not overly dependent on more expensive customer acquisition channels (i.e., are you beholden to Google and Facebook?).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Another metric we look at is</span><b> decreasing customer acquisition costs (CAC)</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">: is your cost to acquire each customer falling or staying flat? Combined with growing organic traffic, flat to down paid CAC translates to declining blended CAC. While it is common for CAC to go up in the earlier days of a startup, as you build a strong brand that drives word-of-mouth, we look for CAC to come back down after you achieve product-market fit.\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">[For a more in-depth discussion of the nuances of organic traffic and CAC, check out </span><a href=\"https://a16z.com/2018/08/08/growth-user-acquisition/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">this podcast (with transcript) with our colleagues Jeff Jordan, Andrew Chen, and Sonal Chokshi</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> on user acquisition and growth.]\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">These four examples are far from the definitive list of moats, but they hopefully serve as a healthy reminder how startups can build enduring businesses, even without high gross margins. Still, the reality remains that if you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have high gross margins, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll often need two or more of these moats to become a highly valued company with meaningful cash flow.\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Ultimately, there is no one path to building a defensible and valuable company. Though some ways, like having high gross margins, might be easier than others, we work with founders every day who are forging the right path for their company.</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><em>The views expressed here are those of the individual AH Capital Management, L.L.C.

In this fireside chat, recorded at <a href=\"https://www.crossbeam.com/supernode/\">Crossbeam Supernode 2022</a>, a16z General Partner Sarah Wang and Bob Moore, Cofounder and CEO of Crossbeam, discuss how partnerships have changed and why the best startups invest early in building a partnership program.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00c2\u00a0 \u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<h2><strong>Transcript</strong></h2>\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong> Everybody give it up again for Sarah Wang here from Andreessen Horowitz. Sarah and I had a stated goal going into this, which is we want to make this conversation completely identical to the conversation that we would just have sitting backstage whether you were here or not, as we dig into just about everything in the realm of the partnerships universe, the market, and beyond.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s obviously a lot of shifts going on in the market at large, but at the same time, these really exciting things in the partnerships universe that seem to amount to a shift of their own. I just want to generally understand how real is that and how real do you think this growth through partnerships is really becoming?</p>\n<p><strong>Sarah:</strong> I think a lot of what you said was spot on, and, I\u2019ll bring a different perspective, which is that of fundraising. I\u2019ve been an investor for over a decade and seen different cycles\u2013and full caveat, I don\u2019t have a crystal ball into what is going on, but clearly something is going on. What\u2019s very interesting in the fundraising market that has started to turn is not only are valuations coming down, rounds have started to not get done.</p>\n<p>What that means is that being more efficient has started to come back in vogue. For a very long time, all valuations were completely correlated with growth. Now, if you run the math on the public markets, if you look at even private rounds, growth plus efficiency, your margin, your profitability, however you wanna measure it, is the biggest driver of what your company is actually valued at.</p>\n<p>What does that mean for companies? I think there\u2019s a round of belt tightening coming. To translate this further, what does that mean for the people in this room, for your teams? Honestly, partnerships are more important than ever, specifically because you\u2019re bringing in pipeline, you\u2019re shortening sales cycles, and you\u2019re increasing conversion rates. That\u2019s a very good thing. That is need to have, not nice to have, especially in this environment. In an environment where fundraising is virtually free, and the market is flowing, it\u2019s almost more nice to have than need to have.</p>\n<p>The flip side is that if you\u2019re not doing that I think there is some danger. One example that came up recently, I was looking at two companies. I won\u2019t name names, but one company is around $100M ARR, and their plan is to go to $200M. I\u2019m looking at the other company where they\u2019re at $5M ARR, and their plan is to go to $15M. One has 50% partner generated pipeline, and the other, the smaller one, has 100% sales generated pipeline.</p>\n<p>As an investment team, we\u2019re more willing to bet that the $100M goes to $200M because of how consistent their partner generated pipeline has got. That team could literally go to sleep for a year and come back, and they\u2019d be at $200M ARR. We feel very confident about that.</p>\n<p>The sales generated pipeline we\u2019ve discounted that internally from $5 to $10M of ARR, so cut it in half essentially. That\u2019s a real life example of how investors and board members are thinking about it.</p>\n<h3>The nature of partnerships has changed</h3>\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong> A lot of what you\u2019re saying about the importance of partnerships, would it have been true five years ago? Would\u2019ve been true 10 years ago. And if not, why not?</p>\n<p><strong>Sarah:</strong> Honestly, five years ago, no. Even when Jennifer Li and I we\u2019re doing our diligence, we talked to some old school sales folks who told us partnerships are where non-revenue things go to die. That was the misconception for a very long time, and to be fair, there probably were some not well run partnerships teams where the ROI was low back in the day.</p>\n<p>I think what\u2019s changed is a couple things. One, there\u2019s just been this Cambrian explosion of SaaS applications, and it doesn\u2019t make sense for everyone to spin up a direct sales team and go heavy at this expensive, direct effort. The shift to best in class means that you\u2019re probably not going to get into a customer and upsell a monolithic suite the way you used to if you were SAP or Oracle. That\u2019s just not how customers want to buy software these days. That\u2019s not how they optimize their own internal ROI.</p>\n<p>This ecosystem play that Bob mentioned in his opening remarks is a way of life. The ecosystem of startups and established companies is just so much richer than it was before. Customers see that, and if you\u2019re not selling alongside the software that they also want to be using, you\u2019re at a real disadvantage.</p>\n<p>This concept actually plays out in that you start to see stacks. I don\u2019t know if there are any data companies, anyone who touches the data ecosystem in the audience? You hear about the modern data stack. What does that look like? Honestly, we talk to stakeholders, it starts to converge. Everyone is saying, Hey, my modern data stack has Snowflake. It has Fivetran. It has dbt. It has, X, Y, Z in it, and if you\u2019re not named in that, you actually start to fall behind.</p>\n<p>The smart ones, including some of the companies in the list that I just mentioned are selling together, and that\u2019s a really big change in the environment.</p>\n<h3>Technology and channel partnerships converging</h3>\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong> Yeah, I may go slightly off book here because you just made me think of a really interesting nuance that we try to handle in our content, but is always a little challenging, which is this difference between technology partnerships and channel partnerships. One trend that has been really interesting for us is this convergence of these two categories, because at the end of the day, they both start to be all about the revenue of storytelling. Whether you started on the product side and building a tech integration, or you started on the services side and bringing the last mile of service delivery, what ends up happening really is this deal acceleration, this increase in ACV, et cetera.</p>\n<p>When you talk about half of the pipeline is from partners. Is that tech partners, is it service partners? Is it a combination of the two, and do VCs in the boardroom think about those things differently or are they converging into one stack?</p>\n<p><strong>Sarah:</strong> Yeah, I would say the most powerful programs usually combine the two, and it\u2019s great that you bring that up. A quintessential and by the way, some of you may partner with this company, so you can keep me honest, but one of the quintessential examples of a successful tech company channel partnership is UiPath, a company called UiPath, which works in the process automation space. The factoid that people like to share is that for every dollar that UiPath would make, UiPath would generate its partner $4. You can imagine that its partners were pretty darn motivated to sell UiPath to their customers, and Accenture has a lot of customers.</p>\n<p>This mutually beneficial relationship very much exists in that world, and I think those who take advantage of them, like a UiPath, have really benefited from digging into this gigantic customer base that they bring.</p>\n<p>Then the second piece I mentioned, diversity. Having all of your eggs in one basket is never a good thing. I can tell you, as an investor, when I look at a partner generated pipeline, the first thing I ask is, \u201cIs it all being generated by one partner?\u201d The reason I had so much conviction in that example that I mentioned to you of going from $100M to $200M was that this company had 50 partners that were all generating no more than 5% of revenue each. It was a sign to me of predictability.</p>\n<h3>Startups are hiring early for partnerships</h3>\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong> Yeah, that\u2019s incredible. You talked a little bit about the old stigma of partnerships and that journeyman sales person who says, partnerships is a parking lot. In the good old days of partnerships, if you had a co-founder and didn\u2019t quite know what to do with them, and the business had outgrown them, you just make them head of partnerships.</p>\n<p>There is a little bit of that, and what I think has been so amazing is just the rise of the partnership professional and how much credibility and importance has been placed on that discipline and the expertise that can be built up around a person that truly is a partnership leader in the purest sense of the word.</p>\n<p>I wonder if you can talk about that a little bit about the discipline of partnerships, the importance of that partnership hire, and when this comes up in the boardroom, what are the things that, from an org chart perspective, are part of the conversation?</p>\n<p><strong>Sarah:</strong> Yeah, absolutely a lot to unpack there. Maybe I\u2019ll start with the first question. One of the things that I\u2019ve been very fascinated by as just a student of go-to-market, and actually as a prior investor in a company called ZoomInfo, I don\u2019t know if you guys have heard of that sales and marketing intelligence tool.</p>\n<p>One of the things when we first invested in ZoomInfo, back in 2014 when I was with another firm, that we really rode the wave of was the rise of the SDR. This is old news. It\u2019s a decade plus long trend. Big change at the time, back in 2014, as you can imagine. People were like, \u201cWhat are SDRs? They\u2019re useless, etc.\u201d But at the time, they were growing 3x the rate of field sales. Now, I haven\u2019t met a company without a team of SDRs. It\u2019s pretty commonplace.</p>\n<p>What\u2019s been really interesting as a student of go-to-market evolution is the rise of the PDR. Bob, one of the things you talked about on this stage just earlier was that partnerships is about collaboration. It\u2019s not about this zero-sum game, where I\u2019m going to have to pull this lead out of you, and then I\u2019ll try to resist giving you anything. It\u2019s actually the more generous you are, the more you get. That is the ethos of partnerships that I think is very different than sales and very additive to sales.</p>\n<p>One of the neat things that we\u2019ve seen is that, \u201cHey, how do you actually implement and professionalize this?\u201d Having PDRs, or people who are really dedicated to helping partners, and in turn, having them help, you has really started to become a trend in our portfolio and outside of our portfolio.</p>\n<p>More generally in the boardroom, partnerships is the number one hire that we hear our early companies make. For the companies that have really nailed it, our best performing companies are relying very heavily on partnerships.</p>\n<p>I threw out there a company where 50% of their pipeline was being generated by partnerships. One of my best friends is a VP of enterprise sales. She told me that she joined her current company because she heard that partnerships we\u2019re a big part of generating pipeline, and who wants to fight the uphill sales-led battle of 100% pipeline generation?</p>\n<p>So, it\u2019s the number one hire that we hear for our Series B and earlier companies. When it works, it\u2019s very much tied to results. That\u2019s the new era of partnerships that we\u2019re seeing.</p>\n<h3>Selling as part of a best-in-class stack</h3>\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong> Yeah, that\u2019s so fascinating. In fact, when we started Crossbeam we used to say our target market is anybody that has the word partnerships in somebody\u2019s title somewhere, and usually that\u2019s companies with 200+ employees, or 300+ employees. We\u2019re starting to see partnership hires get made employee #5, employee #10.</p>\n<p>I wonder if you can unpack that a little bit. What do you think is happening? What do you think is different? Maybe it\u2019s some of the things we\u2019ve already touched on, but this seems like part of Cambrian explosion of SaaS apps and just the relevance of this earlier on in the product-market fit journey for these companies.</p>\n<p><strong>Sarah:</strong> Yeah, we now have this new wave of companies that were startups, but are now very successful, like a Snowflake or a Shopify. For them, their next layer of growth is actually monetizing their existing customer base. They\u2019re all creating marketplaces. You probably have seen them or are part of them. That\u2019s not an accident or experiment. They\u2019re looking for their next avenue of growth, and there\u2019s this bigger willingness to partner with newer companies that come back and help their bottom line, obviously, but also enrich that ecosystem that they\u2019re creating.</p>\n<p>And then the second piece does come back to this point about selling in a stack and being one of the default names that people go to because every buyer gets lazy, right? You don\u2019t want to do a full RFP of everything. You just want to ask your friends, \u201cHey, what are you using?\u201d If you start to hear eight out of 10 friends say the exact same names in their stack, and you have respect for them, they\u2019re the leaders in their space, you\u2019re like, \u201cHey, I can\u2019t go wrong buying the new IBM, which is a stack of the top best software tools in whatever space you\u2019re in.</p>\n<p>I think those two combined have led to this migration much earlier. To your point, I do see partnerships being the 5th hire, the 10th hire, the 20th hire. From an investor and boardroom perspective, we\u2019re highly encouraging of that. If you can get in, get your name in the door, get the right integrations in place, it\u2019s not just a sales and marketing story, it\u2019s also a product story. Get the right partners to be focused on you, and you\u2019re actually accelerating way past your competitors much earlier on and creating a self-fulfilling prophecy around yourself.</p>\n<h3>Unbundling, APIs, and the staying power of partnerships</h3>\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong> Yeah, that\u2019s incredible. I often quote this interview that Marc Andreessen was in, where there\u2019s this glib quote that there\u2019s only two ways to make money in software, bundling and unbundling.</p>\n<p>You talk about things like the modern data stack, and it\u2019s a perfect example of this massive unbundling cycle, where what used to be this one product has now been deconstructed into an entire ecosystem of these interconnected best in class tools.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s almost like we\u2019re in the midst of the great unbundling with the the emergence of the API economy and the maturity of it. It seems like almost every stack has been exploded out into these many best-in-class kind of slices of the pie. Are we ever at risk of rebundling, and do you ever see that out in the markets? When you think about this awesome connective tissue that we\u2019re all responsible for building at this conference are there reasons to believe that\u2019s got staying power and that\u2019s actually the new way, or are we part of just a really interesting piece of a sin wave that is history repeating itself.</p>\n<p><strong>Sarah:</strong> Yeah, that\u2019s a great question.</p>\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong> I try to spring things we didn\u2019t plan for on you on stage.</p>\n<p><strong>Sarah:</strong> Yeah, and I\u2019ll fully admit, who knows? But I think there are a couple indicators that we are in something that has staying power. I actually keep going back to the ecommerce example because I talked to one buyer recently. I was like, \u201cHey, what\u2019s your stack?\u201d He named 20 things, literally 20 items. On the one hand, I was like, \u201cHey, that\u2019s a lot of things, do you want to consolidate?\u201d</p>\n<p>He told me, \u201cI was doing everything on Salesforce before.\u201d Sorry. I hope there are no Salesforce people here, but he said, we were all on Salesforce commerce cloud before this. It\u2019s just in this market, we need customization. We need flexibility. WIthout that, we\u2019re actually losing revenue and falling behind our competitors. The next gen and the new wave of tooling out there is the only way he was able to get that for his company.</p>\n<p>In this API economy, where integrations are more seamless than ever, there\u2019s no more trade off for companies to say, \u201cHey, actually, we should just go for this monolithic solution and sacrifice quality because at least all of my systems talk to each other.\u201d We\u2019re just seeing less of that because the trade off is not there anymore.</p>\n<h3>Proving the ROI of partnerships internally</h3>\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong> Yeah, and user experience ends up playing a really big role, too. I think for every employee that we have at Crossbeam there are two or three SaaS apps. The number of SaaS apps we use is a multiple of the number of employees we have, but the number that we actually log into and interact with is actually, scoped within an individual role, relatively small. It\u2019s really all of this machinery in the background that is this enabling technology. Whether it sits behind Slack, or it\u2019s sitting behind Salesforce, or sitting behind the tools of record for a department, it becomes so much more powerful as an enabling layer and as a data layer.</p>\n<p>That\u2019s where I want to get back to a little bit of the inside baseball in the boardroom stuff and put it through the lens of the people that are in this room. We\u2019ve got a lot of people that lead partnership teams. We\u2019ve got a lot of partner managers who are on partnership teams. If they are in a meeting in a few weeks with their CEO, and they\u2019re telling the story about why in the next year, we should double the size of the partnerships team, or we should make these really amazing investments, what are some of the things that the CEO might be looking to hear? What are the things the CEO heard in their last board meeting that they\u2019re really trying to focus and optimize the company on?</p>\n<p><strong>Sarah:</strong> I\u2019ve said this before, but it does all come back to ROI. This is where revenue is generated and accelerated. Having the stats that track that is incredibly important. I\u2019ve seen partnerships really accelerate sales through tangibly shorter sales cycles, higher conversion rates. I think that\u2019s the first thing.</p>\n<p>When I think back on, what does a successful partnership program look like? What does a best in class one look like? And what is the starting off point that you can have a valid justification for wanting to expand your team? There\u2019s a press release, you shake hands, we have a partnership. But why does that partnership exist, because that is going to symbolize how much their AEs are going to work for you. When I see that sort of very rock solid justification in place that to me is a sign of a lasting partnership.</p>\n<p>The second piece is really, and Bob, you actually mentioned this point, and it got me really excited in the diligence process. The best partnership organizations have really infiltrated sales teams, like AEs were talking to the partnerships team nonstop. They had really discovered it in a way where I was hearing stories of AEs getting promoted 3 times in one and a half years, because they had discovered the value of partnerships data. They had not just done this, \u201chey, every quarter, you got any leads for me?\u201d That kind of thing is not going to work. You\u2019ve got to have your data real time integrated.</p>\n<p>You\u2019ve got to have a system for consistently mining partnership data. It\u2019s not gonna do it for you. You\u2019ve got to actually do that, but what is your system in place? This goes back to the predictability point, is this something that you\u2019re continually going back to to build your pipeline? How deeply integrated beyond just the partnerships team is that process and some of the tooling? That\u2019s what actually gets back to the third and most important thing that I mentioned, which is measuring that ROI.</p>\n<p>Those are some of the attributes of best in class partnerships teams. When those are all in place, I see the justification sell itself.</p>\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong> Amazing what a perfect note to end on. Sarah Wang, I want to thank you so much for being here, coming to Philly, coming to Supernode. Thanks again everybody. Thanks guys.</p>\n<p><strong>Sarah:</strong> Thanks for having me.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\">***</p>\n<p><em>The views expressed here are those of the individual AH Capital Management, L.L.C.

While podcasts differ widely in terms of content, format, production value, style, and length, they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re all distributed through RSS, or Really Simple Syndication, a standardized web feed format that is used to publish content. For podcasts, the RSS feed contains all the metadata, artwork, and content of a show. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">To listen to a podcast, a user adds the RSS feed to their podcast client (such as Apple Podcasts, Spotify, etc.), and the client then accesses this feed, checks for updates, and downloads any new files. Podcasts can be accessed from computers, mobile apps, or other media players. On the podcast creator side, creators host the RSS feed as well as the show\u00e2\u0080\u0099s content and media on a hosting provider, and submit the shows to various directories, such as Apple\u00e2\u0080\u0099s podcast directory. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Podcast content is typically available for free, though creators can choose to set up private RSS feeds that require payment to access.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Current headlines about podcasts today hail them as the next major content medium, describing them as \u00e2\u0080\u009csuddenly hot\u00e2\u0080\u009d, as the next battlefield for content, and as an \u00e2\u0080\u009cantidote\u00e2\u0080\u009d for our current news environment:</span></p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-288727 size-large\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"204\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/podcast-news-1.png?resize=1024%2C204&amp;ssl=1\" width=\"1024\"/></p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-288730 size-large\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"205\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/podcast-news-2.png?resize=1024%2C205&amp;ssl=1\" width=\"1024\"/></p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-288731 size-large\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"197\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/podcast-news-3.png?resize=1024%2C197&amp;ssl=1\" width=\"1024\"/></p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-288732\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"245\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/podcast-news-4.png?resize=1024%2C245&amp;ssl=1\" width=\"1024\"/></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">How did this \u00e2\u0080\u009csuddenly\u00e2\u0080\u009d happen? As with all tech trends, it had a longer and slower start before going more mainstream. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s time travel back 15 years ago, when there were no smartphones and the internet was accessed only through desktop computers. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In February 2004, journalist Ben Hammersley wrote about the emergent behavior of automatically downloading audio content in a February </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2004/feb/12/broadcasting.digitalmedia\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">article</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> in <em>The Guardian</em>:</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u00e2\u0080\u009cMP3 players, like Apple\u2019s iPod, in many pockets, audio production software cheap or free, and weblogging an established part of the internet; all the ingredients are there for a new boom in amateur radio. But what to call it? Audioblogging? Podcasting? GuerillaMedia?\u00e2\u0080\u009d</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In doing so, Hammersley accidentally invented the term we still use today, \u00e2\u0080\u009cpodcasting\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u2014 a portmanteau of \u00e2\u0080\u009ciPod\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009cbroadcast\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u2014 for this kind of content. The word was added to the Oxford English Library later that year.</span></p>\n<p><img alt=\"History of podcasting\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-288733\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"540\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Podcast-Deep-Dive-April-2019-FOR-BLOG_PDF-5.jpg?resize=960%2C540&amp;ssl=1\" width=\"960\"/></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In 2005, podcasts were added to the iTunes store, with Steve Jobs saying, \u00e2\u0080\u009cPodcasting is the next generation of radio, and users can now subscribe to over 3,000 free Podcasts and have each new episode automatically delivered over the Internet to their computer and iPod.\u00e2\u0080\u009d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In 2007, the first iPhone was introduced, but it wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be until 2012 that Apple created the Podcasts app. The release of this app is widely considered an inflection point for the industry, as it put podcasts a single tap away for hundreds of millions of users around the world. Ironically, a few months later, Google discontinued its own podcast app called Google Listen. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In 2014, the first season of </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Serial</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> aired, considered to be the first breakout podcast, with its narrative audio journalism drawing in 5M downloads in the first month. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In the past 5 years, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been an explosion of listening behavior and innovative content. New devices made it easier to listen: Alexa launched in 2015, Google Home and AirPods in 2016. And an explosion of new content \u2014 ranging from daily news to narrative to talks shows \u2014 met the growing listener appetite. In tandem, ad spend has been growing steadily each year, from $69 to $220M in 2017 [</span><a href=\"https://ksmmedia.com/intel/tuning-in-to-podcasting/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">source</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">].</span></p>\n<h2><div data-toc-header=\"App Landscape\" id=\"section--9\"></div>The app landscape</h2>\n<h3>Many apps for listening to podcasts, but little differentiation or loyalty</h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Apple Podcasts played a pivotal role in the development of the industry and remains the dominant app for listening. However, its market share has fallen in the last few years, from over 80% to 63%. The corollary to this stat is that historically, podcasting has been predominantly an iOS user behavior, given that Google didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have its own native application, something that changed last summer with the launch of Google Podcasts.</span></p>\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-288734\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" id=\"attachment_288734\" style=\"width: 960px\"><img alt=\"Apple Podcasts is still the dominant app for listening, though its share has declined from 80%+ to 63% in the past few years\" class=\"wp-image-288734 size-full\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"540\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Podcast-Deep-Dive-April-2019-FOR-BLOG_PDF-6.jpg?resize=960%2C540&amp;ssl=1\" width=\"960\"/><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-288734\"><em>Apple\u00e2\u0080\u0099s share of the podcasting market has slipped from over 80% to 63%, while Spotify has quickly grown to almost 10% of the market.</em></figcaption></figure>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Spotify \u2014 which has made a big push into podcasts in just the past couple years \u2014 now accounts for almost 10% of listening.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Beyond these two large companies, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a long tail of listening apps from smaller companies. Most of these apps all have roughly the same content, given widely open directories of podcast RSS feeds. And there\u2019s hundreds more listening apps out there. The barriers to entry for creating a new podcast app are quite low, since content is all distributed via RSS feeds and anyone can access them. There are also tools for creators to create their own podcast app from their own RSS feed. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">A note on comparing listening apps: metrics between apps are not entirely an apples-to-apple comparison, as some apps (like Apple Podcasts, Overcast, and Stitcher) auto-download shows that users subscribe to, whereas others (e.g. Spotify, Castbox) don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t continuously download new episodes. This affects comparisons between apps and may overstate the traction of listening apps that auto-download shows. The industry has not standardized around what defines a download or listen.</span></p>\n<h3>A taxonomy of consumer podcast apps</h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">From our research, users seldom feel passionately \u2014 either positively or negatively \u2014 about the podcast app they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re using. This suggests that the audio content itself is the core element users are engaging with, and since the content is the same on all apps, users don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t feel particular affinity to any one listening app.</span></p>\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-288735\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" id=\"attachment_288735\" style=\"width: 960px\"><img alt=\"Consumer Podcast Listening Apps\" class=\"wp-image-288735 size-full\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"540\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Podcast-Deep-Dive-April-2019-FOR-BLOG_PDF-7.jpg?resize=960%2C540&amp;ssl=1\" width=\"960\"/><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-288735\"><em>Three major categories of consumer podcast listening apps: the incumbent, large existing audience and new podcast focus, and long tail listening apps.</em></figcaption></figure>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">I categorized consumer podcast listening apps into three major categories: </span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The incumbent: Apple Podcasts</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Companies with large, existing audiences who are newly focusing on podcasts</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Long-tail listening apps </span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The major feature of Apple Podcasts is that \u2014 despite its shortcomings in user-facing features and monetization \u2014 it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pre-installed on all iPhones, making it a tap away for 900M people worldwide. We estimate that Apple Podcasts has 27M monthly active users in the U.S., based on App Annie, so a sizeable absolute number but relatively small compared to the total install base. Though Apple accounts for the majority of podcast listening, the company currently doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t monetize podcasting at all \u2014 all ads that you hear on podcasts are a result of advertisers and podcasters connecting off-platform.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">For some users, the app is a basic, functional listening app, as compared to other media apps and products, with rudimentary categorization and discovery features. For some creators, the features it currently lacks include native monetization capabilities, in-depth analytics, demographic information for listeners, or any attribution for where listeners come from. Since Apple Podcasts launched in 2012, the app itself has changed very little. The <em>New York Times </em></span><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/08/business/media/podcasts-surge-apple.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">wrote</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> in 2016 that \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe iTunes podcasting hub that Mr. Jobs introduced remains strikingly unchanged,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and beyond adding more analytics features in 2017, the same still holds true today. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In the second category, there\u2019s a number of media and technology companies that have large existing audiences making a big push into podcasts, including Spotify, Pandora, and iHeartRadio. The strategies for these companies are mostly centered around leveraging their existing audiences to cross-promote podcasts; using listener data to personalize listening experiences or to help surface relevant podcasts; and leveraging their reach and existing monetization mechanisms to help creators earn more revenue. Google, which launched a standalone Podcasts app last year, has </span><a href=\"https://blog.pacific-content.com/exclusive-inside-the-new-google-podcasts-strategy-that-could-double-audiences-worldwide-b556cdc26e43\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">talked</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> about making podcasts a first-class citizen in terms of surfacing podcast content in search results, as well as the growth opportunity that Google users worldwide represent in terms of potential podcast listeners. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Finally, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the long tail of podcast apps. These are comprised of startups and a fair number of non-VC funded companies. These apps are predominantly competing on the basis of better user-facing features such as improved discovery, search, and social capabilities, as well as creator monetization including their own ad networks or direct user monetization features. Increasingly, startups in this last category are also looking for other ways to distinguish themselves outside of listening experience \u2014 including experiments with exclusive, sometimes paid, content. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">A discussion about shifting user behavior around consuming podcasts would be incomplete without calling out Spotify.

The creator landscape reflects a power-law type curve, with most of the podcasts consumed in the top 1% of all content. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">According to Libsyn, one of the oldest podcast hosting providers, the median podcast only has 124 downloads per episode \u2014 but the top 1% has 35K downloads per episode.</span></p>\n<p><img alt=\"Podcast consumption follows a power law with a longtail of hobbyist creators\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-288740\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"540\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Podcast-Deep-Dive-April-2019-FOR-BLOG_PDF-12.jpg?resize=960%2C540&amp;ssl=1\" width=\"960\"/></p>\n<h3>A taxonomy of podcast creators</h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">I created a taxonomy of the podcast creator ecosystem as a rough framework for thinking about the various types of creators, roughly split across five categories: media companies with internal podcast efforts; standalone podcast-only studios; large indies (including what our editor-in-chief Sonal Chokshi calls \u00e2\u0080\u009ccult-of-personality\u00e2\u0080\u009d shows); non-media businesses and nonprofits; and the long tail of hobbyist creators.</span></p>\n<p><img alt=\"Five Types of Podcast Publishers\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-288741\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"540\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Podcast-Deep-Dive-April-2019-FOR-BLOG_PDF-13.jpg?resize=960%2C540&amp;ssl=1\" width=\"960\"/></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In order of descending audience sizes, these categories are:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Media companies that have internal podcast departments</strong>, whose goals in podcasting can range from audience development to diversifying revenue. Examples of companies in this category include traditional media companies like the <em>New York Times</em>, where audio was treated as an experiment before </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The Daily</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/07/how-the-daily-michael-barbaro-became-the-ira-glass-of-new-york-times\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> became</a> a major hit in 2017</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">; radio platforms like iHeartRadio, which bought Stuff Media to double down on podcasting; and digital media companies like Barstool Sports, a sports and pop culture blog which produces a number of podcasts. These companies can leverage their existing user base to drive listenership for the podcast \u2014 and if the podcast becomes popular, vice versa.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Podcast production companies</strong> focused mainly \u2014 if not exclusively \u2014 on podcasting, which necessitates building a viable business from podcasting alone. Their revenue primarily comes from advertising, which means those podcasts need to amass large, repeatedly engaged listener bases. Examples include Gimlet (the creator of <em>Reply All</em>, <em>StartUp</em>, <em>Crimetown</em>, and others), acquired by Spotify in early 2019; and Wondery (<em>Over My Dead Body</em>, <em>Generation Why</em>, <em>Dr. Death</em>). </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Large indies and personality-driven talk shows</strong> primarily hosted by one or two personalities. These podcasts monetize mostly through ads, donations, and sometimes merchandise or live events. Examples include Tim Ferriss, Sam Harris, Rachel Hollis, Karen Kilgariff and Georgia Hardstark (<em>My Favorite Murder</em>), Roman Mars (<em>99% Invisible</em>), Joe Rogan, and many others. </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Non-media businesses and nonprofits</strong> that also produce podcasts. The primary goal behind these podcasting initiatives is mostly brand-building and marketing, rather than driving revenue. Mailchimp and HBS podcasts fall into this category.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Lastly, there are the <strong>individual hobbyists</strong> creating and posting content \u2014 often un-monetized and with very limited audiences. Podcasting tools like Anchor and others are democratizing the ability to launch a podcast, which will lead to more and more hobbyist creators. </span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Note that these categories serve as a rough segmentation of the creator landscape, because there is a lot of overlap and blurriness between some of them. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">For instance, NPR \u2014 the #1 podcast publisher in terms of downloads \u2014 produces many hit podcasts including <em>Hidden Brain</em>, <em>How I Built This</em>, <em>Planet Money</em>, and others, and is considered by some as having raised the profile of the medium overall. NPR sells ads on its podcasts and has teams of designers, planners, and strategists, but is technically a non-profit media organization. While podcasting has deep roots in public radio \u2014 <em>This American Life</em>, for instance, launched in 1995 under WBEZ (Chicago Public Radio) \u2014 the non-profit aspect of these organizations has implications on the business. Alex Blumberg, the CEO of Gimlet and a cofounder and producer of <em>Planet Money</em>, was </span><a href=\"https://www.vulture.com/2019/03/are-we-in-a-podcast-bubble.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">reportedly</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> frustrated with NPR\u00e2\u0080\u0099s slow decision-making and strict rules around advertising, which led him to found Gimlet: \u00e2\u0080\u009c\u00e2\u0080\u0098We should be making more; people want more\u2026 There should be the Planet Money of technology! Of cars!\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u009d</span></p>\n<h3>Rich variety of content</h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The top iTunes podcasts chart from May 2019 is interesting for its glimpse into the tastes of Americans who have iPhones. A small number of publishers account for multiple top shows, including Wondery and NPR. We can also see how much Americans love crime/mystery content, as well as talk shows!</span></p>\n<p><img alt=\"Top Podcasts Snapshot (iTunes, May 2019)\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-288742\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"540\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Podcast-Deep-Dive-April-2019-FOR-BLOG_PDF-14.jpg?resize=960%2C540&amp;ssl=1\" width=\"960\"/></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">While NPR and iHeartRadio have roughly the same number of monthly downloads, NPR is able to accomplish this with just 48 shows vs. iHeartRadio\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 170.

Despite double-digit percent growth in podcast advertising over the last few years, podcasts are still in a very nascent, disjointed stage of monetization today.</span></p>\n<p><img alt=\"Monetization Mechanisms (1/2)\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-288744\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"540\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Podcast-Deep-Dive-April-2019-FOR-BLOG_PDF-16.jpg?resize=960%2C540&amp;ssl=1\" width=\"960\"/></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Today, podcasts primarily monetize via ads and listener donations. Though we\u2019ve heard anecdotally from advertisers that podcast ads are effective \u2014 and are unique in their ability to reach a hard-to-access, attractive demographic \u2014 the ad buying experience is manual and tedious. Especially compared to purchasing other forms of digital advertising, since the dominant listening platform (Apple) doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t offer a way for hosts and brands to connect. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">As a result, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll see price sheets floating around online for major shows, with set rates to sponsor episodes, based on historic downloads figures. Ad networks in the podcasting space like Midroll Media and AdvertiseCast aim to make this process easier, while more new listening platforms are also enabling easier advertising, for instance by selling ads on behalf of shows in its network.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">But advertising doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t always cover the entire cost of producing a show, even for hit shows. <em>Serial</em> is one of the most successful podcasts ever \u2014 and the first ever podcast to reach </span><a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2014/12/18/showbiz/feat-serial-podcast-btn/index.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">5 million downloads</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> \u2014 and </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2014/nov/26/serial-season-two-podcast-confirmed\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">asked for donations</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> in order to fund the production of the second\u00c2\u00a0season. This American Life also publishes requests for donations, including </span><a href=\"https://www.thisamericanlife.org/about/announcements/please-donate-to-support-the-show\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">these</span></a> <a href=\"https://www.thisamericanlife.org/about/announcements/please-donate-to-support-our-free-podcast-and-streaming\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">blog</span></a> <a href=\"https://www.thisamericanlife.org/about/announcements/please-donate-now-to-support-the-show\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">posts</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> detailing the high costs of producing the show, with Ira Glass </span><a href=\"https://www.thisamericanlife.org/about/announcements/please-donate-now-to-support-the-show\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">writing</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, \u00e2\u0080\u009cPeople sometimes ask me if it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s frustrating, having to request donations directly from listeners. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the fairest way to fund anything: the people who like these stories and want them to exist, we pitch in a few bucks.\u00e2\u0080\u009d </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Donations to podcasters primarily happen off-platform today, via third-party tools such as Patreon, PayPal, and Venmo. The top podcaster on Patreon, Chapo Trap House, a political humor podcast, earns over $131K per month from almost 30K patrons (</span><a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/chapotraphouse\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">link</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">). Himalaya, the U.S. podcasting app backed by the Chinese company Ximalaya, has a donations feature. And some other listening apps also have introduced one-off tipping capability or patronage features.</span></p>\n<p><img alt=\"Monetization Mechanisms (2/2)\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-288745\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"540\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Podcast-Deep-Dive-April-2019-FOR-BLOG_PDF-17.jpg?resize=960%2C540&amp;ssl=1\" width=\"960\"/></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Another monetization mechanism that companies are experimenting with is branded content. As opposed to advertising \u2014 which first start with the content and then sell ads to monetize \u2014 branded shows create a podcast in collaboration with a company, for a fee. Examples include The Mission, which is selling to enterprises to create branded podcasts \u2014 for instance, a podcast called The Future of Cities, sponsored by Katerra; and Gimlet, which has collaborated on shows like The Venture with Virgin Atlantic. By removing dependence on ads for monetization, branded shows like these are able to go deeper into a subject matter and create more niche content that doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t rely on listening volume to generate revenue. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also a lot of activity happening right now in the subscription and membership space. Recently-launched podcasting app Luminary Media (which bills itself as the \u00e2\u0080\u009cNetflix for podcasts\u00e2\u0080\u009d) charges $8 a month for access to a slate of more than 40 exclusive podcasts, and the app also has a free listening experience. The launch has been bumpy, with issues ranging from podcasters <a href=\"https://podcastbusinessjournal.com/luminary-does-a-belly-flop-on-twitter/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">taking offense at their tweet</a> that \u00e2\u0080\u009c</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Podcasters don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t need ads</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u00e2\u0080\u009d; to controversy about </span><a href=\"https://hotpodnews.com/luminary-cleans-up-the-show-notes-links-situation/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">removing links in show notes</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, including donation and affiliate links that help podcasters monetize; to <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/25/18515840/luminary-podcast-startup-proxy-server-show-takedown\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">using a </a></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">proxy server to serve podcasts</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, which made it challenging for podcasters to receive accurate analytics. Luminary\u00e2\u0080\u0099s launch serves to signal a few things \u2014 that the golden age of investing in podcasting is underway in terms of dollars flowing in, but also that getting the buy-in of creators is just as important as winning over consumers in building a new platform.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The model of subscription premium audio content is popular in China, where Ximalaya, a unicorn consumer audio platform, has a subscription feature for $3 monthly that enables users to access over 4000 e-books and over 300 premium audio courses or podcasts. Audio content is also available a la carte starting at $0.03 per short, serialized book chapter, or anywhere from $10 to $45 for paid audio courses.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Other monetization models we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen include grants or foundation support, ticket sales for live events, and merchandise sales. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also licensing deals happening with the likes of HBO, Amazon, Fox, and other content companies who view podcasts as a source of intellectual property and want to adapt them into movies and TV shows. For instance, Gimlet\u2019s scripted podcast <em>Homecoming</em> debuted as an Amazon Original Series in November 2018. The directionality of influence goes both ways: some podcasts are offshoots of other content \u2014 such as HBO\u00e2\u0080\u0099s <em>Chernobyl</em> podcast which discusses each episode of the mini-series \u2014 or written content \u2014 like <em>Binge Mode</em>\u00e2\u0080\u0099s deep dive into Harry Potter.</span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://info.a16z.com/register-for-podcasting-ecosystem-download.html\"><img alt=\"Get the full 68-page analysis deck by signing up for our newsletter\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-288758 size-full\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"250\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Ad-2-1.jpg?resize=886%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" width=\"886\"/></a></p>\n<h3>Podcast ad revenue is growing but is still tiny compared to other content formats</h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In 2019, the podcast industry ad revenue is estimated to hit over $500 million dollars, having doubled each year for the past few years.

Reasons include:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Inability to monetize directly on the dominant platform, Apple Podcasts.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The long tail of podcasters not being able to monetize because advertisers only want to work with podcasts that have a high level of listenership. Given the lack of advertising inside major listening apps, advertisers need to connect off-platform with podcasters \u2014 whether directly or through an ad network. This manual process means that for most advertisers, the long tail of podcasts requires too much time and effort to find and work with.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Lack of clarity around actual listens. For a long time, downloads were used to proxy delivered ads, but a \u00e2\u0080\u009cdownload\u00e2\u0080\u009d doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t necessarily mean a \u00e2\u0080\u009cplay\u00e2\u0080\u009d.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Detailed listener data is also not available. There\u2019s also a lack of sophisticated targeting tools on par with what Facebook and other digital platforms offer advertisers.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Today, podcast ads are primarily direct response, with ads read by hosts. You\u00e2\u0080\u0099re probably familiar with ads on podcasts with hosts talking about a product and verbally sharing a discount code. Podcast ad attribution is very rudimentary: the common methods of attribution are vanity URLs (for instance, www.ecommercewebsite.com/&lt;podcastname&gt;); promo codes entered at checkout; and surveys asking users, \u00e2\u0080\u009cHow did you hear about us?\u00e2\u0080\u009d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Despite all these issues and barriers to monetization, podcasts are still able to command a premium CPM of $25 to $50, based on downloads, due to their efficacy. And the highest performing shows can cost even more.</span></p>\n<h3>How much are podcasters making?</h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">While the majority of shows don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t monetize at all, the most successful ones can earn substantial revenue through advertising. A couple of data points: in July 2018, The <em>New York Times</em>\u00e2\u0080\u0099 <em>The Daily</em> podcast was </span><a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/07/how-the-daily-michael-barbaro-became-the-ira-glass-of-new-york-times\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">projected</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> to book in the low eight-figures revenue in 2018 from ads, and had 5 million listeners monthly and 1 million listeners daily, or about $2 to $10 revenue per monthly listener. For context, <em>The Daily</em> was only started in January 2017. For comparison, in 2018, Spotify </span><a href=\"https://investors.spotify.com/financials/press-release-details/2019/Spotify-Technology-SA-Announces-Financial-Results-for-Fourth-Quarter-2018/default.aspx\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">earned</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> $605M from 111M monthly ad-supported listeners, or $5.45 per free listener.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The <em>New York Times</em> as a whole had $709 million in digital revenue in 2018, so podcasting is still small relative to their entire business, but has an outsized impact on brand awareness. Michael Barbaro, the host of <em>The Daily</em>, </span><a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/07/how-the-daily-michael-barbaro-became-the-ira-glass-of-new-york-times\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">shared</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> in </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Vanity Fair</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> that \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhen we started the show, we had many goals.

Most of these exits have been \u00e2\u0080\u009cacquihires\u00e2\u0080\u009d of small listening apps that were subsequently shut down post-acquisition. More recently, podcast studios with expertise producing popular content have also been a target of acquisition, including Stuff Media (to iHeartRadio) and Parcast (to Spotify).</span></p>\n<h3>Startup trends: new apps, monetization experiments, production experiments</h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been a flurry of funding activity in podcasting \u2014 so much so that some publications are wondering if we are in a \u00e2\u0080\u009cpodcast bubble\u00e2\u0080\u009d (see for example </span><a href=\"https://www.cjr.org/the_new_gatekeepers/podcast-bubble-burst.php\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">this</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, </span><a href=\"https://jacobsmedia.com/podcasting-a-bubble-about-to-burst-a-slow-leak-or-just-a-chance-to-catch-our-breath/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">this</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, and <a href=\"https://www.vulture.com/2019/03/are-we-in-a-podcast-bubble.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">this</a></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">).

Consumer listening apps for general podcast content</h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">A lot of startup activity is happening on the consumer side of listening apps: Many startups are capitalizing on the opportunity to create a better listener experience, given that Apple Podcasts is relatively simple and bare-bones, and until recently, there has been no default listening app for Android users. Issues these apps are addressing include better discovery of podcasts through algorithms, curation, or social signals; more effective ways to search for relevant content (e.g. by automatically transcribing podcasts so as to be able to search within them); or improved social features. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">We on the consumer team tend to believe that better podcast discovery, recommendations, and other user-facing features alone aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t sufficient to draw a large listener base. The core of what users are interacting with on a listening app is the content itself \u2014 after all, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s normal for listeners to start playing audio content, then to background the app or put their phones away, so the listening app becomes secondary to the content. As a result, many podcasting startups have expressed interest in offering some flavor of exclusive content, as well as monetization options for creators, in order to further differentiate themselves. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a small sample of the approaches some of these new listening apps are taking: </span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Charging consumers directly for podcasts \u2014 these apps\u00e2\u0080\u0099 exclusive podcasts account for a relatively small share of all of the content available in these apps. Examples include Luminary and Brew, both of which have subscription models for access to exclusive content, in addition to allowing users to listen to widely available free podcasts. </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Adding a social layer onto podcasts \u2014 to help with discovery and/or to capture the conversation happening around podcasts. Some early companies in this space include Breaker, Swoot, and others. </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Offering translation and transcription \u2014 essentially enabling </span><a href=\"https://a16z.com/2019/04/02/podcast-about-podcasting-industry-ecosystem-state-of-podcasting-2019/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">episode-level rather than show-level discovery</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. Castbox, for instance, offers podcasts in multiple languages, as well as the ability to search within podcasts by transcribing content. The app also recently launched live audio broadcasting that allows anchors to interact with listeners via voice, text, and call-in and to earn tips from followers.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Adding context \u2014 Since podcasts expose listeners to so much new information and prompt questions, these could be more seamlessly explored without disrupting the listening experience. Entale, for example, is a \u00e2\u0080\u009cvisual podcast app\u00e2\u0080\u009d that uses AI to showcase relevant information to users as the podcast is playing \u2014 this could be displaying the Amazon link to a book that someone mentions, or linking to the Wikipedia page about a speaker\u00e2\u0080\u0099s biography. </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Specializing by vertical \u2014 For parents growing increasingly cognizant of exposing kids to screen time, having a curated selection of audio content targeted towards kids, suitable for entertainment and learning, can be valuable. Leela Kids, for example, is a children\u2019s podcast app that curates kids-safe content.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>2. Vertical consumer audio apps</h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Beyond general and for-kids podcasts, there\u2019s also a number of adjacent audio apps with more focused content, including those targeting education, audio books, fiction, health and wellness and fitness. By focusing on a specific subject matter and going very deep, these apps aim to create </span><a href=\"https://a16z.com/2015/01/22/the-full-stack-startup/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">full-stack</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> listening experiences that combine original content around that particular vertical; user monetization mechanisms; and other value-added features that enhance the user experience and help users achieve their goals. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">To give a few examples, Calm and Headspace are both guided audio meditation apps, which offer both free and subscription-only content that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s exclusive to their own platforms. Both have features beyond just the content itself that help users with mindfulness \u2014 for instance, daily reminders, streaks, visualizations and videos, etc. In the ASMR (autonomous sensory meridian response) vertical, Tingles is an app where fans can watch or listen to videos of ASMR content, filter by specific categories, and support creators through subscriptions. In the fitness category, Aaptiv, ClassPass Go, and MoveWith are examples of companies offering audio fitness classes across a variety of exercise types.</span></p>\n<h3>3. Podcast production companies</h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Lastly, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a surge of venture-backed podcast production companies creating podcast content and distributing it through third-party listening platforms. Examples of these include Wondery, the studio behind a number of hit shows including <em>Dirty John</em>, <em>Dr. Death</em>, and <em>American History Tellers</em>; and WaitWhat, the content incubator that developed <em>Masters of Scale</em> with Reid Hoffman and <em>Should This Exist</em>. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Most podcast producers are creating entertainment-focused, general interest content that appeals to a wide audience, likely because of their monetization model, which is primarily ad-supported. Since these content studios distribute through other platforms and don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have direct relationships with end users, they need to monetize through advertising, which necessitates content that appeals to a wide audience and promotes lengthier consumption times and ongoing listening.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Successful production studios could be prime acquisition targets for media companies as efficient sources of IP, or for consumer listening apps as a way to differentiate based on content \u2014 and a number of startups in this space have already been acquired. Another possibility is that once these content companies generate enough listener traction, they could create distribution platforms of their own, and use these as a way to deepen listener relationships and diversify revenue, for instance by charging users for, say, early access to content, back catalogs, exclusive content, or other features.</span></p>\n<h2><div data-toc-header=\"Investment thesis\" id=\"section--14\"></div>So what are we interested in investing in?</h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Given the challenges with monetization, how can startups create a path to becoming a sustainable business? With the distribution and capital advantages that incumbents have \u2014 coupled with the fact that Apple and Google own the end mobile platforms, where are the opportunities for startups? And how do we evaluate these opportunities?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">To understand startup opportunities, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s important to consider where the incumbents and large audio companies like Spotify, Pandora, and iHeartRadio are uniquely advantaged:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Consumer traction and awareness, and a large audience to which podcasts can be cross-promoted</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Large budgets for content production and acquisition</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">User data on preferences and existing media consumption</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Existing monetization mechanisms, such as through ads, subscription</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">So how to navigate creating a large opportunity, given the above advantages?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">We think the most promising players will combine the following aspects:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Focus on <i>audio</i></strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong> content broadly, rather than exclusively podcasts.</strong> Just as the lines between blogs, articles, and other written content online have blurred, the same is happening with all audio content, and so we are interested in all types of content delivered via listening. As outlined above, podcasting was historically synonymous with audio distributed via RSS \u2014 now, with the rise of exclusive, paid podcasts, </span><a href=\"https://a16z.com/2019/04/02/podcast-about-podcasting-industry-ecosystem-state-of-podcasting-2019/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">the distinction</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> between podcasting and other audio content is becoming less meaningful.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>The potential for network effects.</strong> We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve written extensively about </span><a href=\"https://a16z.com/2016/03/07/all-about-network-effects/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">network effects</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> and </span><a href=\"https://a16z.com/2018/12/13/16-metrics-network-effects/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">how to measure them</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">; the consumer team loves businesses with network effects! Network effects in audio could take different forms. Like many content platforms, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a two-sided marketplace network effect, where more high-quality content makes the platform more valuable to consumers, and more users makes it more appealing for content producers to distribute their content there. All things being equal, most users would prefer to use the platform that has the largest, best inventory of audio content. A social audio app could also have direct network effects, where the experience becomes better with more users/friends.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">While we prefer full-stack startups that own the experience end to end (positive feedback loops from listening app to content to monetization), we wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t rule out breakout apps that are strong on any one aspect. </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>High-quality differentiated and deeper content vs. broad, free libraries of shallower content.</strong> Since the large incumbents seek content that appeals to their large user bases, they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re less focused on seemingly niche, in-depth content. We also believe that for certain high-value content verticals, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s potential to shift the burden of payment to businesses, schools, or other organizations \u2014 rather than on to end consumers. </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Consumption experience that enhances the experience of the audio content.</strong> This could be through live, social audio, or other features that increase stickiness and engagement. For instance, Headspace\u00e2\u0080\u0099s meditation streaks, animations, multi-level categorization, and session length options differentiate and enhance the experience, compared to listening to meditation audio content on general podcast listening apps.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Alternative monetization </strong></span><strong>beyond solely ads</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> (Connie Chan <a href=\"https://a16z.com/2018/12/07/when-advertising-isnt-enough-multimodal-business-models-product-strategy/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">has written</a> a lot about this). Given the dominance of existing large platforms like Google and Facebook for ad targeting, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s becoming increasingly challenging to build a new large company based on advertising alone. We are bullish about audio companies that are aiming to monetize users directly \u2014 this could be accomplished through charging for content that has higher perceived ROI, or by introducing payments as a way to alter the content experience (e.g. social recognition after tipping in live streams). More importantly, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also a way to align incentives of consumers with content creators.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>What could some examples of these startups look like?</h3>\n<h4>1. Vertical audio platforms</h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re excited about startups that are going deep within a particular vertical and building a full-stack audio experience tailored to that vertical. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s less chance of incumbents competing directly here, given the more niche focus and fundamental differences in feature sets needed to enhance the user experience. We also see greater willingness for users to pay for content that has higher perceived ROI \u2014 for instance, various fitness and meditation/wellness audio apps have already gained high levels of traction in usage and monetization.</span></p>\n<h4>2. Interactive, social audio\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 finally</h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">While people have been talking about it for years, we think there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s still an opportunity to finally have truly interactive, social audio. Without being too prescriptive on what this looks like (we want founders to tell us!), the fact is, audio content today is still largely broadcast in nature, with a one-directional flow of information from creator to listener. While there are some conversations happening around audio content (including on Twitter, Reddit, and other forums), they happen in a fragmented, isolated way, and on platforms that aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t designed for that purpose.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Call-ins to radio and live talk shows are two current forms of interactive audio, with the social element fundamentally contributing to the content itself. Twitch also has podcasters who use the platform to live stream themselves while recording, sometimes responding to user comments which become part of the show\u00e2\u0080\u0099s content. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a number of startups enabling users to comment on static podcast content, but the social experience needs to become even more interactive to attract a wider audience and pull users off existing platforms. In China, live audio broadcast, group karaoke, and even audio dating products are flourishing, and there may be an opportunity to create an audio product that is more interactive and social for U.S. audiences, too.</span></p>\n<h4>3. Platforms that helps creators own their end users and monetize content</h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Most creators are disintermediated from their end listeners, since they produce content that is distributed solely through various third-party platforms. Given the brand equity and large followings that some creators have established, we believe that there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an opportunity to give these creators a way to distribute their own content, own their customers, and to monetize through alternative sources besides advertising and off-platform donations.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Some influential podcast publishers have developed their own solutions to engage and/or monetize their own audiences, including </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Slate Plus</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, <a href=\"https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2014/04/what-is-slate-plus-editor-david-plotz-on-slates-new-membership-program.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">a paid membership program</a> from Slate with podcast benefits including ad-free and bonus podcast; </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The Athletic</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, which <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/the-athletic-launches-podcast-network-65f115a8-da39-409b-98df-80d74a325966.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">launched over 20 exclusive shows</a> behind a paywall in April; and </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">BBC Sounds</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, an app <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/help/sounds-intro\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">that puts music, podcasts, and radio</a> from BBC into one personalized destination.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">But for creators who don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have the technical or financial resources to develop their own apps or piece together various third-party solutions to accept payments or manage members, there could be a turnkey platform for creators. Down the line, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s opportunity to create a network of these creators and listeners, along the lines of \u00e2\u0080\u009ccome for the tool, stay for the network.\u00e2\u0080\u009d</span></p>\n<h3>The future</h3>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u00e2\u0080\u009cIf you think of audio as the way you think of, say, film, like we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re still in the black-and-white period of podcasting.

As a result, most of the CFO tools built in recent years have focused on transacting and record-keeping. Many of those existing finance products are rife with problems:</span></p>\n<p><b>The software stands alone</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. None of these software products integrate with each other and none of the data flows from one product to another. In addition, these products don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t connect to other key systems for sales, HR, and marketing functions, such as Salesforce, Workday, or Marketo. To update the company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s forecast for a newly hired employee, for example, someone on the finance team typically needs to send a series of emails across the finance and HR departments.\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/CFO-Tools-Post-Graphics-v4_CFO-Tools-1.2.jpg?ssl=1\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-299726 size-large\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"877\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/CFO-Tools-Post-Graphics-v4_CFO-Tools-1.2.jpg?resize=1024%2C877&amp;ssl=1\" width=\"1024\"/></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Moreover, each of these products is built solely for the finance team\u00e2\u0080\u0094usually for a single person on that team to own and operate. Though the finance team works closely with other departments to receive input and develop plans, their existing tools don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t allow multiple users across teams to contribute and collaborate.</span></p>\n<p><b>Data is stale, limited, and hard to access. </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">An enterprise resource planning (ERP) system, the central repository for financial data, is primarily designed around accounting. As a result, it only gives finance teams a backward-facing view, typically two or more weeks after the month\u2019s end. With that lag, the CFO often has difficulty assessing cash burn, revenue, or expenses in real-time. It goes without saying that, particularly now, most companies can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t afford to wait six weeks to figure out when they are going to run out of cash.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">These building block tools also provide little in the way of predictive forecasting and benchmarking against competing companies. Moreover, retrieving that data, cleaning it, and turning it into a user-friendly format often requires SQL experience, which the finance team may or may not have.</span></p>\n<p><b>Manual entry and reconciliation never end</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. The CFO role is plagued by manual, repetitive tasks, from initiating bank transfers to recording checks into the ledger. In preparation for the month-end closing, cash movement (wires, credit cards, bank account balances, etc.) needs to be matched against the total product sold and the invoices paid. All of this information is then painstakingly pulled into reports and investor presentations. Though closing software like FloQast exists to create checklists and flag irregularities, data entry and categorizing is largely still performed by hand.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">To make matters worse, none of these products have particularly intuitive interfaces and can take months to train users on. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s why so many finance teams ultimately stick with a familiar workhorse: Excel.</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The potential to build something better</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">As finance has taken an increasingly pronounced role in organizations, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve rightly come to expect software that enables predictive analytics, integrated communication, cross-company collaboration, and automation. These new tools will free up time and resources to focus on strategic decision making (and assist in doing so).\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">These are some of the areas where we see opportunity:\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><b>1. Intelligent Building Blocks.</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s time to rebuild tools for point solutions like expense management that can also offer predictive analytics and forecasting. Imagine if your expense software told you who usually paid on time and who didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t, sent reminders, and set payment terms based on past performance. Already, Brex, Divvy, Airbase, Ramp, and others have replaced clunky legacy systems with products that are intuitive, easily integrated with other systems, and that yield greater control. What\u00e2\u0080\u0099s more, many of these companies issue physical and virtual cards to provide an accurate record of all transactions. This saves countless backoffice hours typically spent correcting human error. A bigger challenge will be to design a new general ledger, one that pulls in operational data and tracks customer lifetime value in real time, rather than just accounting statements.</span></p>\n<p><b style=\"font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif\">2. Integrated Data Layer.</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> Another approach is to build connective tissue\u00e2\u0080\u0094software that sits on top of existing tools, extracts data, and provides intelligence to help with dynamic planning. It could also provide benchmarking to help companies better understand how their metrics (from compensation to cash burn to days payable) compares to their peers. That might mean a workforce planning tool that assesses your payroll, cap table management, and budget to enable better headcount decisions. That planning tool would also automatically map headcount to revenue growth and planning for product launches.\u00c2\u00a0 Or this could be a collaborative cash flow management tool that sits on top of procurement and expense management and tracks spending. </span></p>\n<p><b style=\"font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif\">3. Banking Operations<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. Software can also help companies better manage their banking operations. With software that connects to their bank accounts, companies could understand their cash position, debt, and money movements in real-time. In addition, such software could send and receive payments on an automated basis (better than having to manually fill out a form to initiate wire transfers) and assist with treasury management to reconcile payments.\u00c2\u00a0</span></b></p>\n<p><b>4. Automating Data Entry and Reporting. <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Finally, software can help automatically extract and review data. Receipts and checks are not going to disappear overnight, but tech tools like optical character recognition and machine learning can eliminate the need to manually enter invoice information, collect receipts, and match the information against checks received on a company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s bank statement. Similarly, reports and board updates can be automatically pre-populated by creating connections into the right data sources.</span></b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Increasingly, companies in this space also have the ability to monetize with fintech, through transaction revenues, lending, or even insurance. This shift has been driven by a few trends. First, companies are eager to transact online\u00e2\u0080\u0094it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s viewed as more efficient and trustworthy than cutting paper checks to pay invoices or payroll. Second, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve witnessed the creation of a fintech infrastructure that enables companies to take payments and connect with banking partners. Expense management companies, for example, can easily spin up virtual cards to collect an interchange fee on all expenses filed. Accounts payable (AP) and accounts receivable (AR) software companies can collect transaction fees when customers use their platforms to facilitate payments. Finally, software companies are providing better data to underwrite risk for financial services. Cash flow lending and invoice factoring, for example, are possible based on that AP and AR data. These financial products provide finance software startups with an additional source of revenue. And because those tools are often tied to volume, the market grows\u00e2\u0080\u0094and the product becomes stickier\u00e2\u0080\u0094as customers process more business.</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Finance tools for the current moment</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">These are just a few ideas; there are many possibilities. Such tools will allow companies to manage cash and allocate resources more efficiently in downturns, as well as spend more prudently and collaborate more effectively in good times. Sales, marketing, and engineering have all substantially upgraded their tools over the last 5 to 10 years; it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s time to shift the focus to finance. By blending fintech and enterprise, these products have the potential to finally bring the CFO suite into the modern era.</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Thanks to Stewart Ellis, Jeff Jordan, Sharon Olexy, Kristina Shen, and Sid Tiwari for their input.</span></i></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\">***</p>\n<p><em>The views expressed here are those of the individual AH Capital Management, L.L.C.

But he didn\u2019t turn to TripAdvisor for crowd-sourced suggestions (too time consuming) or scroll through Instagram for local geotags (too imprecise). Instead, Gallen enlisted recommendations from other nearby tourists through a <a href=\"https://a16z.com/2015/08/06/wechat-china-mobile-first/\">WeChat</a> group chat organized by the online travel provider Ctrip.</p>\n<p>The Chinese company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s virtual-tour-manager program (VTM) uses <a href=\"https://a16z.com/2016/07/24/money-as-message/\">WeChat group chats</a>\u00e2\u0080\u0094populated by other Ctrip travelers in your destination city at the same time and overseen by a Ctrip representative\u00e2\u0080\u0094to provide a real-time concierge service. Through the group chat, Gallen ended up renting a car with a local Chinese-speaking driver and spending the day with other solo travelers at Pandawa Beach on Bali\u00e2\u0080\u0099s southern coast.</p>\n<p>In early 2015, \u00e2\u0080\u009c<a href=\"https://medium.com/chris-messina/conversational-commerce-92e0bccfc3ff\">conversational commerce</a>\u00e2\u0080\u009d was hailed as the future of online shopping. Back then, the term was commonly applied to tech like shopping bots and voice assistants. But the subsequent rise of private messaging suggests that group chats may actually be the secret to turning conversations into commerce. Companies across verticals in China, including travel providers, gyms, edtech startups, and parenting groups, are all leveraging private group chats to build trust, interactivity, and community into their brand experience.</p>\n<p>The shift from sprawling social networks back to smaller, more niche groups is becoming increasingly apparent in the US, as well. Even Mark Zuckerberg acknowledged the trend in a blog post this spring, noting, \u201cWe already see that private messaging, ephemeral stories, and small groups are by far the fastest growing areas of online communication.\u00e2\u0080\u009d But while group chats in the West are most often populated by <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/26/20833903/facebook-instagram-threads-messaging-app-close-friends-snapchat\">our friends</a>, China provides multiple examples of <em>companies</em> using group chats to facilitate deeper customer relationships and social commerce.</p>\n<h2>Turning trust into transactions</h2>\n<p>Brands have discovered that user trust is a crucial metric in turning a network into a transaction platform. (It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s one big reason Apple and Amazon have been able to expand into new revenue streams so quickly.) In the West, companies have adopted strategies like end-to-end encryption and real-name policies to reinforce a sense of security. In Asia, messaging platforms use a different set of tactics to build trust.</p>\n<p>On WeChat, for example, group chats are discovered entirely by word-of-mouth or <a href=\"https://a16z.com/2017/08/11/qr-codes-in-china/\">QR code</a>\u00e2\u0080\u0094there is no global search option. The QR code is automatically disabled once a group reaches 100 members. Once the group grows to that size, users can only join if invited by a friend; groups are capped at 500. This means that even large group chats have a built-in social filter, since anyone who joins the group is likely the friend of at least one other existing group member. As a result, every group feels like a secret, known only to other members.</p>\n<p>Cultivating a sense of safety is key. Unlike WhatsApp and Signal, which reveal users\u00e2\u0080\u0099 private cell phone numbers to the group\u2013 or the <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/community/education/blog/facebook-group-chat-removal/\">now-defunct</a> chats within Facebook Groups, which exposed users\u00e2\u0080\u0099 real identities\u2013WeChat allows its users to adopt aliases. Those anonymous usernames act as a privacy shield, giving users control over how their identities are displayed. (Though it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hidden from other group users, WeChat does require a phone number and real-name verification to sign up, which curtails anonymous troll abuse.)</p>\n<p>Another trust-building policy is truncating messages. Newcomers who join WeChat or WhatsApp group chats are unable to view any of the previous messages, which lends a semblance of privacy for existing group members.</p>\n<p>Once brands have developed trust among users, they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re able to leverage these social networks into new revenue streams in a variety of areas.</p>\n<h3>Concierge Services</h3>\n<p>Customer service chat portals are already popular on modern ecommerce websites and can be easily implemented with third party software. But <em>group</em> chats on messenger apps can help transform traditional customer service into a crowd-sourced concierge service. Ctrip\u00e2\u0080\u0099s virtual tour manager, just one example, was used for 10 million trips in 2017 and <a href=\"http://www.chinanews.com/business/2018/10-25/8659202.shtml\">14 million</a> trips in 2018.</p>\n<p>Common concierge requests in VTM group chats include airport pickup, drivers, tours, and spa and restaurant reservations. The group chat dynamic allows Ctrip to upsell services and share relevant information in a way that feels communal, rather than commercial. In addition, Chinese travelers get the reassuring perk of access to a bilingual service representative. During the Las Vegas shooting in October 2018, Ctrip <a href=\"https://www.ttgasia.com/2018/01/08/ctrips-colossal-ambitions/\">used VTM</a> to quickly locate its customers visiting Vegas and offer them flights home the following day.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/plug.png?ssl=1\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-294058 size-large\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"502\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/plug.png?resize=766%2C502&amp;ssl=1\" width=\"766\"/></a></p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">A traveler asks a Ctrip representative which electricity plug to use.</span></em></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/taxis2.png?ssl=1\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-294074 size-large\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"666\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/taxis2.png?resize=766%2C666&amp;ssl=1\" width=\"766\"/></a></p>\n<p><em>Another customer asks a Ctrip representative how to choose a local taxi.

Upon purchasing a course, students are invited to join a WeChat group along with the instructor and roughly 100 fellow students. Each day, the instructor assigns a new activity, such as conducting mock interviews, studying song lyrics, or playing educational games like Word Snake (pictured below). Not only do these groups lend a social component to what is otherwise a one-on-one tutoring app, they also facilitate student relationships beyond the scope of the course.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/lingochamp.png?ssl=1\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-294055 size-large\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"547\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/lingochamp.png?resize=974%2C547&amp;ssl=1\" width=\"974\"/></a></p>\n<p><em>A Lingochamp representative initiates a game of Word Snake among Chinese students learning English.</em></p>\n<p>Similarly, Supermonkey, a network of tech-enabled gyms that has raised over $60M of venture capital, utilizes group chats to build offline relationships among gym-goers. When a user signs up for a Supermonkey workout class, he or she receives the instructor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s WeChat contact card and is added to the class\u00e2\u0080\u0099s chat group. There, Supermonkey instructors share social-media friendly class photos, nutrition tips, playlists, and more. Students also interact with one other\u00e2\u0080\u0094making plans to go dancing, reselling spots in upcoming classes, and chatting. Since Supermonkey does not require any monthly or annual membership, it relies on these \u00e2\u0080\u009conline classroom\u00e2\u0080\u009d groups for customer retention.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-294186 size-full\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"1080\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/supermonkey-screenshot.png?resize=1920%2C1080&amp;ssl=1\" width=\"1920\"/></p>\n<p><em>Gym-goers post photos, resell class passes, and send messages in a Supermonkey group chat.</em></p>\n<p>Class-based private group chats are also gaining traction among businesses in the US. Lambda School, a San Francisco startup that provides online tech training at no up-front cost, uses <a href=\"https://a16z.com/2019/06/20/slack/\">Slack</a>. Using the app, Lambda students can work together on projects and direct questions to fellow students or administrators. Other Lambda School Slack channels are intended to add long-term value beyond coding lessons: There are statewide groups to help students create offline connections; #career_help for career advice; and a motivational group called #hired where students post selfies and job acceptance letters. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not a coincidence that when co-founder Austen Allred was asked what Lambda School uses Slack channels for, he responded, \u00e2\u0080\u009c<a href=\"https://twitter.com/Austen/status/971537001773019136?s=20\">Literally everything</a>.\u00e2\u0080\u009d</p>\n<h3>Consultations and Commerce</h3>\n<p>Sales representatives can be highly effective in persuading shoppers to make purchase decisions in physical stores. Some companies are exploring ways of bringing a similar experience into the home via private group chat. Kidswant, a maternity and kid-focused retailer that has raised over $55 million in venture capital, is an ecommerce company that has opened more than 250 physical retail stores in China. The company employs over 6,000 child care consultants, many of them former clinical nurses or professional caregivers, who often split their time between working in-store and answering questions online in private group chats. In-store consultants can add shoppers to Kidswant group chats, where parents might book private lessons or ask questions on topics ranging from breastfeeding to pediatric massage. The app recommends WeChat groups for nearby stores, so online shoppers are connected with other nearby parents. Consultants can also share promotion links and product reviews within the chat group.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/baby.png?ssl=1\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-294054 size-large\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"666\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/baby.png?resize=758%2C666&amp;ssl=1\" width=\"758\"/></a></p>\n<p><em>In a group chat, a Kidswant consultant gives advice for introducing infants to solid food.</em></p>\n<p>Similarly, Ctrip employees facilitate purchases for airport rides, Chinese-speaking drivers, boat rentals, and day tours in VTM chat groups.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/offshore.png?ssl=1\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-294056 size-large\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"666\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/offshore.png?resize=658%2C666&amp;ssl=1\" width=\"658\"/></a></p>\n<p>The poster child for this form of chat-related commerce in China may be Pinduoduo, a group-buying business in which the unit price of an item becomes cheaper as more users purchase the deal together. Founded in 2015, the now public company has more than 366 million monthly active users. Pinduoduo\u00e2\u0080\u0099s dramatic growth came from leveraging WeChat group chats: to secure lower prices, netizens created shopping groups with friends and strangers for the purpose of sharing deals. Pinduoduo\u00e2\u0080\u0099s rapid ascent in the Chinese ecommerce space proves the merit of <a href=\"https://andrewchen.co/whats-your-viral-loop-understanding-the-engine-of-adoption/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">viral loops</a>, especially when group chat sharing is part of the purchasing experience.</p>\n<h2><strong>The next phase of \u201cconversational commerce\u201d</strong></h2>\n<p>From chatbots to shopping via smart speaker, previous modes of conversational commerce have largely failed to live up to the hype in the US. But perhaps the reason is not that we are still waiting for next-generation technology; rather, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been viewing commerce too narrowly, as an individual experience. Group chats set up by businesses don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have to feel transactional; to users, such chats can feel more like interest groups than one-on-one sales pitches. They can provide community and crowdsourced knowledge in an organic way while simultaneously helping the brand behind them build trust and sell products.</p>\n<p><em>Additional reporting by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/avesegal\">Avery Segal</a>.\u00c2\u00a0</em></p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The views expressed here are those of the individual AH Capital Management, L.L.C.

The federal judge who first heard arguments in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York this week indicated he would rule by April 30; however, he also emphasized that the court will not be rendering an opinion on cryptocurrency at large or a particular subset of cryptocurrencies, and that whether a cryptocurrency is inherently a security is \u00e2\u0080\u009cnot what this case is about.\u00e2\u0080\u009d It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the sale of tokens and the launch conditions that are at issue.\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">But the broader concern is about whether a \u00e2\u0080\u009ccapital raise\u00e2\u0080\u009d took place, and that has implications for other industries including and beyond crypto.\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">How can that be?\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">First, some basics. In the U.S., securities can be sold only if they are registered with the SEC or if they qualify for an exemption from registration. The classic example of a registered offering is an initial public offering (\u00e2\u0080\u009cIPO\u00e2\u0080\u009d) \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the SEC reviews the disclosures made by the company to potential purchasers and imposes on the issuer a series of ongoing financial and operational disclosure </span><a href=\"https://a16z.com/2016/12/01/ipo-readiness-checklist-wishlist/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">requirements</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> to protect investors </span><a href=\"https://a16z.com/2019/07/09/ipo-process-prices-behind-scenes-companies/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">in the public</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> markets.\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">But private markets rely on a series of well-established exemptions to the registration process. Simply put, \u00e2\u0080\u009caccredited\u00e2\u0080\u009d investors (meaning rich people or institutions such as university endowments and foundations) can purchase unregistered securities from the issuer via a set of rules known as 506(b) or 506(c) under Regulation D. In effect, the securities laws enable such so-called \u00e2\u0080\u009csophisticated\u00e2\u0080\u009d buyers and sellers to transact without the SEC\u00e2\u0080\u0099s formal intervention, presuming that each party can protect itself without the need for an extra set of SEC-prescribed disclosure statements.\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The most obvious example of this is a venture capital firm investing in a Series A offering for Company X. The firm does its diligence, enters into a set of legal contracts with Company X that defines the firm\u00e2\u0080\u0099s rights and restrictions, wires money to Company X and thus is able to purchase a security known as a Series A preferred stock.\u00c2\u00a0That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the typical process for the private sale of unregistered securities from a company to an investor.\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">What happens, however, if some time in the future the venture firm wants to sell its shares in Company X? Under the SEC\u00e2\u0080\u0099s well-established rules, the firm can sell unregistered securities under Rule 144, which allows public resale of restricted and controlled securities if a number of conditions are met. But it basically says that if an investor has held the securities for 6-12 months \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the time period depends on whether the company is publicly reporting and whether one is an \u00e2\u0080\u009caffiliate\u00e2\u0080\u009d of the company (a fancy way of saying board member or substantial shareholder) \u00e2\u0080\u0094 then that investor is generally free to sell the stock to another sophisticated investor or into the public market if the company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s shares are publicly traded.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><b>So why does this matter?</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">This is a commonplace and well-settled law from the 1970s, and as a result, the rule has been a significant factor in the rise of the venture capital industry that has led to some of the most important companies, in turn </span><a href=\"https://a16z.com/2017/06/19/ipos/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">resulting</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> in jobs creation, economic growth, and more.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">But the SEC case against Telegram appears to ignore this legal precedent.\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Instead, the SEC said in their original complaint that the private, institutional investors who entered into the Telegram purchase agreement (which was sold privately as a security under the appropriate regulatory statutes) did so with the intention of distributing the tokens to unsuspecting investors (\u00e2\u0080\u009cunloading it on the unadvised public\u00e2\u0080\u009d) \u00e2\u0080\u0094 rather than through the orderly sale of securities to accredited investors as outlined in the SEC\u00e2\u0080\u0099s own Reg. D rules for registering for an exemption before filing.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">That is, even though many of the investors could hold the tokens for more than a year (or already did if they were able to \u00e2\u0080\u009ctack\u00e2\u0080\u009d their holding period back to the date of the purchase agreement, another common practice under securities laws), we should ignore that and assume that the original purchase was done under false pretenses because, in the SEC\u00e2\u0080\u0099s words, it was obvious that the only way that the investors would profit from their investment was to sell to those unsuspecting investors.\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In legal terms, the SEC is implying that those investors were effectively \u00e2\u0080\u009cunderwriters\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u0094 intermediaries who bought Grams with an eye toward selling it or an asset underlying it to some unsuspecting member of the public. This not only contradicts 50 years of settled regulation around Rule 144, it also calls into question the very nature of purchases of private securities and the potential resale of those securities in the private or public markets.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">So why should we care? Because if the SEC\u00e2\u0080\u0099s interpretation stands, any purchaser of a security issued by a non-public company could be deemed to be an underwriter. That has two big implications:\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">First, traditional underwriters (e.g., investment banks) can be subject to legal liability for any material misstatements or misrepresentations made by the issuer of a security. This makes sense in the traditional underwriting scenario because the underwriters are being paid a fee to market and sell a security offering \u00e2\u0080\u0094 they have a duty to make sure they are doing so with full and appropriate disclosures to the buyer of a security. </span>Under the SEC\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Telegram interpretation of 144, however, any <i style=\"font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif\">buyer</i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> of a private security would now be deemed an underwriter and thus subject to potential liability for misdeeds of the issuer. This could mean a buyer of the security could in theory sue another buyer of the security for some bad behavior on the part of the issuer/seller of the security? That doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t make sense.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0</span></li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Second, if a buyer is deemed to be an underwriter, they may also be unable to engage in an otherwise lawful common exempt resale of that security at a later date. This is because in the Telegram case, the SEC equates a desire to sell at a profit, despite complying with the holding period contained in Rule 144, with an intent to unload to an unsuspecting public and therefore impermissible. </span>Again, a strange outcome: Why would anyone buy a security if they were unable to later sell that security, as long as they of course comply with existing security laws that govern the later sale?</li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Whether this proposition will survive the Telegram case <em>per se</em> remains to be seen, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s important to pause and examine it, given the important precedents under which buyers and sellers of private equity have operated. If left to stand, private companies may find themselves unable to raise capital from investors who may fear that they are taking on broader liability as an underwriter when they look to sell their investments at a later date. This is important because a key underlying principle of private markets is that early investors are willing to take on risk and can de-risk said investments for later investors.\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">If policymakers wish to make changes to the process by which private companies raise capital and in turn create companies that can create value in other ways, they should honor the normal rule-making and legislative process rather than seeking to change policy via enforcement actions. \u00c2\u00a0 </span><span style=\"font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif\">\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">***</span></p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The views expressed here are those of the individual AH Capital Management, L.L.C.

Many people reported feelings of a sort of \u00e2\u0080\u009csticker shock\u00e2\u0080\u009d (or reverse!) on leaving their first startup. Meanwhile, founders genuinely want to do right by their employees and other stakeholders \u2014 but owning part of a company isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t a static, fixed thing; it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fluid, and there are a number of factors that could change the overall ownership equation over time.</p>\n<p>Part of the problem is the sheer amount and complexity of information required to understand equity and ownership in the first place. Which is why many founders are working hard to build trust while navigating shifting ownership \u2014 their own, their employees\u00e2\u0080\u0099, their co-founders\u00e2\u0080\u0099, their investors \u2014 along the way, often dedicating resources to educating folks. There are also some great <a href=\"https://quip.com/HEB3Ah9dYD6o\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">overviews</a>,\u00c2\u00a0<a href=\"https://go.gusto.com/rs/110-WOX-868/images/Framework_Offering_Your_Employees_Equity.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">guides</a>, and <a href=\"https://carta.com/blog/better-job-offer-letter/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">templates </a>out there now that cover how options and compensation works. So we thought we\u00e2\u0080\u0099d share more here about how the <em>economics</em> behind startup options and ownership works\u00e2\u0080\u00a6</p>\n<h5>Cap Table<strong>\u00c2\u00a0</strong></h5>\n<p>The capitalization or \u00e2\u0080\u009c<strong>cap\u00e2\u0080\u009d tabl</strong><strong>e</strong> reflects the ownership of all the stockholders of a company \u2014 that includes the founder(s), any employees who hold options, and of course the investors. For most people to understand how much of a company they actually own, all they really need is the fully diluted share count, the broader breakout of ownership among different classes of shareholders, and a couple other details. The <strong>fully diluted share count</strong> (as opposed to the <strong>basic share count</strong>) is the total of all existing shares + things that might eventually convert into shares: options, warrants, un-issued options, etc.</p>\n<p>Let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s introduce a hypothetical example that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll use throughout this post. Here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a new company that has no outside investors, and existing stock allocated as follows:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"captableexample-part1\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-15405\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"181\" sizes=\"(max-width: 674px) 100vw, 674px\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/captableexample-part1.png?resize=674%2C181&amp;ssl=1\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/captableexample-part1.png?w=674&amp;ssl=1 674w, https://i0.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/captableexample-part1.png?w=300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/captableexample-part1.png?w=125&amp;ssl=1 125w\" width=\"674\"/></p>\n<p>If someone were offered 100 options, those shares would come out of the 1,000-share option pool, and so they\u00e2\u0080\u0099d own 100/10,000 or 1.0% of the fully diluted capitalization of the company.</p>\n<p>But that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just the <em>starting point</em> of ownership, because any analysis of percent ownership in a company only holds true for a point in time. There are lots of things that can increase the fully diluted share count over time \u2014 more options issued, acquisitions, subsequent financing terms, and so on \u2014 which in turn could decrease the ownership percentage. Of course, people may also benefit from increases in options over time through refresher or performance grants, but changes in the numerator will always mean corresponding changes in the denominator.</p>\n<h5>Financing History</h5>\n<p>For each financing round (of convertible preferred stock), there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an original issue price and a conversion price:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The <strong>original issue price</strong> is just what it says: the price per share that the investor paid for its stock. This price tells us what various financial investors believe the value of the company was at various points in time.</li>\n<li>The <strong>conversion price</strong> is the price per share at which the preferred stock will convert into common stock. Remember, <strong>\u00e2\u0080\u009cpreferred\u00e2\u0080\u009d stock</strong> is usually held by investors and has certain corporate governance rights and liquidation preferences attached to it that the rest of the <strong>\u00e2\u0080\u009ccommon\u00e2\u0080\u009d stock</strong> does not have.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In most cases, the conversion price will equal the original issue price, though we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll share later below where the two can diverge.</p>\n<p>The exercise price of employee options \u2014 the price per share needed to actually own the shares \u2014 is often less than the original issue price paid by the most recent investor, who holds preferred stock. How much of a difference in value depends upon the specific rights and the overall maturity of the company, and an outside valuation firm would perform what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s called a <a href=\"https://a16z.com/2020/02/13/16-things-about-the-409a-valuation/\"><strong>409a Valuation</strong></a> (named for a specific section in the IRS tax code) to determine the precise amount.</p>\n<h5>Dilution</h5>\n<p>Dilution is a loaded word and tricky concept. On one hand, if a company is raising more money, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s increasing the fully diluted share count and thus \u00e2\u0080\u009cdiluting\u00e2\u0080\u009d or reducing current owners\u00e2\u0080\u0099 (including option-holding employees\u00e2\u0080\u0099) ownership. On the other hand, raising more money helps the company execute on its potential, which could mean that everyone owns slightly less, but of a higher-valued asset. After all, owning 0.09% of a $1 billion company is better than owning 0.1% of a $500 million company.</p>\n<p>If the company increases the size of the option pool to grant more options, that too causes some dilution to employees, though hopefully (1) it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a sign of the company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s being in a positive growth mode, which increases overall value of the shares owned (2) it means that employees might benefit from those additional option grants.</p>\n<p>Let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s return to the example we introduced above, only now our company has raised venture capital. In this Series A financing, the company got $10 million from investors at an original issue price of $1,000 per share:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"captableexample-part2\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-15404\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"196\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/captableexample-part2.png?resize=1024%2C196&amp;ssl=1\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/captableexample-part2.png?w=1128&amp;ssl=1 1128w, https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/captableexample-part2.png?w=300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/captableexample-part2.png?w=768&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/captableexample-part2.png?w=1024&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/captableexample-part2.png?w=1120&amp;ssl=1 1120w, https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/captableexample-part2.png?w=125&amp;ssl=1 125w\" width=\"1024\"/></p>\n<p>The fully diluted share count increases by the amount of the new shares issued in the financings; it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s now 20,000 shares fully diluted. This means the employee\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 100 options now equate to an ownership in the company of 100/20,000, or 0.5% \u2014 no longer the 1% she owned when she first joined. But\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 the value of that ownership has increased significantly: Because the price of each share is now $1,000, her stake is equal to 100 shares * $1,000/share, or $100,000.</p>\n<p>While not all dilution is equal, there <em>are</em> cases where dilution is dilution \u2014 and it involves the <strong>anti-dilution protections</strong> that many investors may have. The basic idea here is that if the company were to raise money in a future round at a price less than the current round in which that investor is participating, the investor may be protected against the lower future price by being issued more shares. (The amount of additional shares varies depending on a formula.)</p>\n<p>Most anti-dilution protections \u2014 often called a <strong>weighted average adjustment</strong> \u2014 are less dilutive to employees because they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re more modest in their protection of investors. But there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s one protection that does impact the other shareholders: the <strong>full ratchet</strong>. This is where the price that an investor paid in the earlier round is adjusted 100% to equal the new (and lower) price being paid in the current round. So if the investor bought 10 million shares in the earlier round at a price of $2 per share and the price of the current round is $1 per share, they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re now going to get double the number of shares to make up for that, equaling a total of 20 million shares. It also means the fully diluted share count goes up by an additional 10 million shares; all non-protected shareholders (including employees) are now truly diluted.</p>\n<p>By the way, this isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t just theoretical: We saw the effects of such a full ratchet in the <a href=\"https://a16z.com/2015/11/20/ipos-private-public-valuations/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Square IPO</a>, where the Series E investors <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2015/11/10/squares-s-1-of-ratchets-and-unicorn-valuations/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">were issued</a> additional shares because the IPO price was half the price at which those investors had originally purchased their shares.</p>\n<p>Ideally, anti-dilution protections wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t come into play at all: That is, each subsequent round of financing is at a higher valuation than the prior ones because the company does well enough over time, or there aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t dramatic changes to market conditions. But, if they do come into play, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a \u00e2\u0080\u009cdouble whammy\u00e2\u0080\u009d of dilution \u2014 from both the anti-dilution protection (having to sell more shares, thus increasing the denominator of fully diluted share count) as well as the lower valuation.</p>\n<h5>Liquidation Preferences</h5>\n<p>Some investors may also have liquidation preferences that attach to their shares. Simply put, a <strong>liquidation preference </strong>says that an investor gets its invested dollars back first \u2014 before other stockholders (including most employees with options) \u2014 in the case of a liquidity event such as the sale of the company.</p>\n<p>To illustrate how such a preference works, let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s go back to our example, only now assume the company was sold for $100 million. Our Series A investor \u2014 who invested $10 million in the company and owns 50% of the business \u2014 could choose to get back its $10 million in the sale (liquidation preference), or take 50% of the value of the business (50% * $100 million = $50 million). Obviously, the investor will take the $50 million. That would leave $50 million in equity value to then be shared by the common and option holders:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"captableexample-part3\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-15403\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"141\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/captableexample-part3.png?resize=1024%2C141&amp;ssl=1\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/captableexample-part3.png?w=1578&amp;ssl=1 1578w, https://i2.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/captableexample-part3.png?w=300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/captableexample-part3.png?w=768&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/captableexample-part3.png?w=1024&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/captableexample-part3.png?w=125&amp;ssl=1 125w\" width=\"1024\"/></p>\n<p>Given the high sale price for the company in this example, the liquidation preference never came into play. It would, however, come into play under the following scenarios:</p>\n<p><em>Scenario 1.</em> If the sale price of a company is not sufficient to \u00e2\u0080\u009cclear\u00e2\u0080\u009d the liquidation preference, so the investor chooses to take its liquidation preference instead of its percentage ownership in the business.</p>\n<p>Let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s now assume a $15 million sale price (instead of the $100 million) in our example. As the table below illustrates, our Series A investor will elect to take the $10 million liquidation preference because its economic ownership (50% * $15 million = $7.5 million) is less than what it would get under the liquidation preference. That leaves $5 million (instead of the $50 million) for the common and option holders to share.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"captableexample-part4\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-15402\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"141\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/captableexample-part4.png?resize=1024%2C141&amp;ssl=1\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/captableexample-part4.png?w=1578&amp;ssl=1 1578w, https://i0.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/captableexample-part4.png?w=300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/captableexample-part4.png?w=768&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/captableexample-part4.png?w=1024&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/captableexample-part4.png?w=125&amp;ssl=1 125w\" width=\"1024\"/></p>\n<p><em>Scenario 2.</em> When a company goes through several rounds of financing, each round includes a liquidation preference. At a minimum the liquidation preference equals the total capital raised over the company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lifetime.</p>\n<p>So, if the company raises $100 million in preferred stock and then sells for $100 million, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nothing left for anyone else.</p>\n<p><em>Scenario 3.</em> There are various flavors of liquidation preference that can come into play depending on the structure of the terms. So far, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been illustrating a <strong>1x non-participating preference</strong> \u2014 the investor has to make a choice to take only the greater of 1x their invested dollars or the amount they would otherwise get based on their percentage ownership of the company.</p>\n<p>But some investors do more than 1x \u2014 for instance, a 2x multiple would mean that the investor now gets 2x of their invested dollars off the top. The non-participating can also become \u00e2\u0080\u009cparticipating\u00e2\u0080\u009d<em>, </em>which means that <em>in addition to</em> the return of invested dollars (or multiple thereof if higher than 1x), the investor also gets to earn whatever return their percentage ownership in the company implies. The impact of this on other stockholders can be significant.</p>\n<p>To isolate the effects of these terms, let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s first look at what happens when our Series A investor gets a 2x liquidation preference. In the $100 million sale scenario, that investor will still take its 50% since $50 million is greater than the $20 million (2 x $10 million liquidation preference) it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s otherwise entitled to. The common and option holders are no worse off than they were when our investor had only a 1x liquidation preference:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"captableexample-part5\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-15401\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"142\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/captableexample-part5.png?resize=1024%2C142&amp;ssl=1\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/captableexample-part5.png?w=1578&amp;ssl=1 1578w, https://i0.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/captableexample-part5.png?w=300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/captableexample-part5.png?w=768&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/captableexample-part5.png?w=1024&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/captableexample-part5.png?w=125&amp;ssl=1 125w\" width=\"1024\"/></p>\n<p>But, if the sale price were the much lower $15 million, the investor is going to capture 100% of the proceeds. Its 2x liquidation preference still equals $20 million, but there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s only $15 million to be had, and all of that goes to the investor.

They\u00e2\u0080\u0099re important considerations, but we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re focusing here only on <em>economic</em> factors in options and ownership.</p>\n<p>However, there is one factor still worth paying attention to because it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s really an economic issue cloaked as a governance issue \u2014 the <strong>IPO auto convert</strong>. This is the language that determines who gets to approve an IPO.\u00c2\u00a0In most cases, the preferred stockholders, voting as a single class of stock, get to approve an IPO: Add up all the preferred stockholders together and the majority wins. This is a good check on the company as it ensures one person/one vote, though each preferred stockholder has a say proportional to their economic ownership of the company.</p>\n<p>Sometimes, however, different investors can exercise control disproportionate to their actual economic ownership. This typically comes into play when a later-stage investor is concerned that the company might go public too soon for them to earn the type of financial return they need having entered late. In such cases, that investor may require that the company get its approval specifically for an IPO, or if the price of the IPO is less than some desired return multiple (like 2-3x) on its investment.</p>\n<p>And that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s how a seemingly governance-only question quickly turns into an economic one: If an investor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s approval is required for an IPO, and that investor is not happy with its return on the IPO, this control can become a backdoor way for the investor to agitate for greater economic returns. How would they do this? By asking for more shares (or lowering the conversion price at which its existing preferred shares convert into common). This increases the denominator in the fully diluted share count.</p>\n<p>To be clear, none of this is to suggest nefarious behavior on the part of later-stage investors. After all, they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re providing needed growth capital and other strategic value to the business, and are looking to earn a return on capital commensurate with the risk they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re taking. But it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s yet another factor to be aware of among all the other ones we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re outlining here.</p>\n<h5><strong>ISOs vs non-quals (and exercise periods)</strong></h5>\n<p>Besides the financing and governance factors that could impact option value, there are also specific <em>types</em> of options that could affect the economic outcomes.</p>\n<p>In general, the most favorable type of options are <strong>incentive stock options</strong> <strong>(ISOs)</strong>. With an ISO, someone doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have to pay tax at the time of exercise on the difference between the exercise price of the option and the fair market value (though there are cases where the alternative minimum tax can come into play). Basically, ISOs mean that startup employees can defer those taxes until they sell the underlying stock and, if they hold it for 1 year from the exercise date (and 2 years from the grant date), can qualify for capital gains tax treatment.</p>\n<p><strong>Non-qualified options (NQOs)</strong> are less favorable in that someone must pay taxes at the time of exercise, regardless of whether they choose to hold the stock longer term. Since the amount of those taxes is calculated on the exercise date, employees would still owe taxes based on the historic, higher price of the stock \u2014 even if the stock price were to later fall in value.</p>\n<p>So then why don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t all companies only issue ISOs? Well, there are a few constraints on ISOs, including the legal limit of $100,000 of market value that can be issued to any employee within a single year (this means getting NQOs for any amount over $100,000). ISOs also have to be exercised within 90 days of the employee\u00e2\u0080\u0099s leaving the company. With more companies thinking about extending the option exercise period from 90 days to a <a href=\"https://a16z.com/2016/07/26/options-plan/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">longer period of time</a>, companies can still issue ISOs \u2014 but if they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not exercised within 90 days of exiting the company, they convert to NQOs regardless of the company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s exercise time, at least under current tax law.</p>\n<h5><strong>M&amp;A </strong><strong>\u00c2\u00a0</strong></h5>\n<p>One of the most frequently asked questions about options is what happens to them if a startup is acquired. Below are some possible scenarios, assuming four years to fully vest but the company decides to sell itself to another company at year two:</p>\n<p><em>Scenario 1.</em> Unvested options get assumed by the acquirer.</p>\n<p>This means that, if someone is given the option to stay with the acquirer and choose to stay on, their options continue to vest on the same schedule (though now as part of the equity of the acquirer). Seems reasonable\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Unless of course they decide this wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t what they signed up for, don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to work for the new employer, and quit \u2014 forfeiting those remaining two years of options.</p>\n<p><em>Scenario 2.</em> Unvested options get cancelled by the acquirer and employees get a new set of options with new terms (assuming they decide to stay with the acquirer).</p>\n<p>The theory behind this is that the acquirer wants to re-incent the potential new employees or bring them in line with its\u00c2\u00a0overall compensation philosophy. Again, seems reasonable, though of course it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a different plan than the one originally agreed to.</p>\n<p><em>Scenario 3.</em> Unvested options get accelerated \u2014 they automatically become vested as if the employee already satisfied her remaining two years of service.</p>\n<p>There are two flavors of acceleration to be aware of here, single-trigger acceleration and double-trigger acceleration:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>In <strong>single trigger</strong>, unvested options accelerate based upon the occurrence of a single \u00e2\u0080\u009ctrigger\u00e2\u0080\u009d event, in this case, the acquisition of the company. So people would get the benefit of full vesting whether or not they choose to stay with the new employer.</li>\n<li>In <strong>double trigger</strong>, the occurrence of the acquisition alone is not sufficient to accelerate vesting. It must be coupled with either the employee not having a job offer at the new company, or having a role that doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t quite match the one they had at the old company.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Note, these are just general definitions. There are specific variations on the above triggers: whether everything accelerates or just a portion; whether people\u00c2\u00a0accelerate to some milestone, such as their\u00c2\u00a0one-year cliffs; and so on \u2014 but we won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t go through those here.</p>\n<p>Not surprisingly, acquirers don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t like single triggers, so they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re rare. And double triggers give the acquirer a chance to hold on to strong talent. Still, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s very unusual for most people to have either of the above forms of acceleration. These triggers are typically reserved for senior executives where it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s highly likely in an acquisition scenario that they won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t \u2014 or literally can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t (not possible to have two CFOs for a single company for example) be offered jobs at the acquirer \u2014 and thus wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have a chance to vest out their remaining shares.</p>\n<p>The simple way to think about all this is that an acquirer typically has an \u00e2\u0080\u009call-in price\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u2014 which includes up-front purchase price, assumption of existing options, new option retention plans for remaining employees, etc. \u2014 that it is willing to pay in the deal. But how the money ultimately gets divided across these various buckets can sometimes diverge from what the initial option plan documents dictate as acquisition discussions evolve.</p>\n<h5><strong>*\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 * \u00c2\u00a0 *</strong></h5>\n<p>As mentioned earlier, anything related to compensation and ownership boils down to building and navigating trust \u2014 whether it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s through education, communication, or transparency. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also an important S.E.C. rule that is in play here: Rule 701, the exemption for issuing employee stock options. This rule says that up to about $5 million in annual option issuances, a company must provide the recipient a copy of the options plan; and then once a company goes beyond the $5 million annual limit, it must also provide a summary of the material terms of the plan, risk factors, and two years worth of GAAP financial statements. Which is great.</p>\n<p>But times have changed, and the 701 requirements that were <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/rules/final/33-7645.htm\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">put into effect April 1999</a> have failed to keep pace. Companies are now staying private longer and are therefore <a href=\"https://a16z.com/2014/09/26/valuation-this-is-the-advice-we-give-our-founders/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">raising more capital</a>, often from new entrants to venture investing with more complicated terms. So simply reviewing a company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s last two years of financial statements doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t say much about the ultimate potential value of options. Rule 701 should be updated to better reflect the information people need to understand options.</p>\n<p>The good news is that if a company goes public, all of the above different rights that preferred stockholders have go away because everyone\u00e2\u0080\u0099s shares convert into common shares. There may still be different classes of common stock (such as dual classes with different voting rights to protect founder-driven long-term innovation) \u2014 but those don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t impact an individual\u00e2\u0080\u0099s economics.</p>\n<p>Startup outcomes are, by definition, unpredictable. Every startup is unique, every situation has unknown variables, and new data will always change the economic outcomes. Working at a startup means getting in early for something that has yet to be proven, which means it could have great risks \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 and potentially, great rewards.</p>\n", "author": "Scott Kupor"}, "190": {"podcast": "Shopatainment: Video Shopping as Entertainment | Andreessen Horowitz", "url": "https://a16z.com/2020/12/14/shopatainment-video-shopping-as-entertainment/", "contents": "Want more a16z?

And though there are U.S. startups vying for this space\u00e2\u0080\u0094not to mention the many existing ecommerce brands that are rightfully eyeing live shopping as an add-on feature\u00e2\u0080\u0094this is not a winner-take-all phenomenon. Ultimately, I believe that </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">every</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> successful future online retailer will one day rely on video over traditional photo-based listings.\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Shopatainment is part art, part game show, part theater, part supply chain management, and part auction house. Most of all, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s retail\u00e2\u0080\u0099s killer app. Here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve learned in my experience as a live ecommerce seller, and buyer \u00e2\u0080\u0094and what founders building in this space need to know.\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<h2>It\u2019s about forming a connection with the seller</h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve previously talked about the importance of </span><a href=\"https://a16z.com/2020/10/19/decoding-gen-z/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">authenticity and relatability</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> in establishing and growing influence, particularly among Gen Z. That sense of an emotional connection is becoming more important than ever. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s why we go to concerts rather than listening to Spotify\u00e2\u0080\u0094it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s less about the connection with the stranger standing next to you and more about the musician\u00e2\u0080\u0099s stories and personal asides between songs. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the glimpses of life behind the music that make us feel an affinity to that artist (and, incidentally, probably buy a band T-shirt after the set).\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<h2><b>Shopatainment is about storytelling</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Forget everything you think you know about influencer marketing. Shopatainment is more about wit, stamina, and sustained energy than a persona with an existing massive following. Less idols, more Lucille Ball. This is brand-building in a microcosm, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s harder than it looks. (Trust me, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve sweated in front of that ring light.) In Asia, for example, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not necessarily the existing Instagram influencers who are the most successful sellers: it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the equivalent of YouTubers, the Twitch \u00e2\u0080\u009c</span><a href=\"https://a16z.com/2020/04/08/lifestyle-streamers/#:~:text=Lifestyle%20streamers%20are%20often%20intimately,less%20time%20to%20engage%20viewers.\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">chatters</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u00e2\u0080\u009d; those who are comfortable livestreaming, ad-libbing, and holding the spotlight for a sustained period of time.</span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Shopatainment-Inline-Graphics-R3_5.jpg?ssl=1\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-492 size-full\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"768\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Shopatainment-Inline-Graphics-R3_5.jpg?resize=1668%2C768&amp;ssl=1\" width=\"1668\"/></a></p>\n<h2><b>Shopatainment will spawn a new breed of influencer</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">A handful of power-sellers will emerge, but they will be new faces, rather than established celebrities or existing popular social media personalities. Instead of models or dancers, star shopatainers are </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">born to sell</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. These sellers will be people you relate to, people you trust and who can keep you entertained. The sellers won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t always be the product creators, although they certainly can be.</span></p>\n<h2><b>When it comes to buying, more buyers can be validating</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Unlike the rise of social vertical communities\u00e2\u0080\u0094a promising trend </span><a href=\"https://a16z.com/2020/12/07/social-strikes-back-fastest-growing-apps/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">in its own right</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u00e2\u0080\u0094the success of a shopatainment platform isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t about fostering community and intimacy among a small group of fellow shoppers. Shopatainment is a numbers game, where seeing more shoppers purchase a product helps with conversion. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the same psychology behind selecting the item on Amazon with the most reviews, gauging the quality of a restaurant based on how many diners you can glimpse through its windows, or favoriting a \u00e2\u0080\u009chot\u00e2\u0080\u009d Zillow listing because it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s had 282 other \u00e2\u0080\u009clikes.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The perception of a crowd reinforces trust, desirability, and confidence. And that makes the eventual purchase validating. When there is limited inventory or limited time, the sale feels like an accomplishment that other buyers congratulate you on.</span></p>\n<h2><b>Merchandise can be sold based on perceived value</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Shopatainment will be especially effective for products that are either exclusive or difficult to find (or source) elsewhere: collectibles, rare streetwear, and the like. This opens up intriguing new avenues for artists, artisanal food and beverage suppliers, clothing and furniture designers, independent creators, and more. A fashion designer might show off the intricate detailing on a new collection and stage a live, click-to-purchase fashion show of its latest looks. A rancher can present his pasture-raised cows, dry-aging technique, and the fine marbling of a fresh cut of steak\u00e2\u0080\u0094then ship you </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">that very filet</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. In shopatainment, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not just purchasing a product. You can also get the history of the item, the process behind making it, a personal connection to the seller, and the benefit of true-to-life demonstrations and visuals. This results in greater affinity to the product\u00e2\u0080\u0094and gives you more interesting things to say when you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re complimented on it.\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<h2><b>Shopatainment is not a one-person show</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The opportunity here extends much further than individual sellers. In Asia, top influencers tap third-party companies who supply everything from lighting and makeup to merchandise and script development, supply chain management, and shipping fulfillment. These crews can even be commission-based, receiving a cut of a successful selling session. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an army of supporting businesses fueling the shopatainment industry. And given the high frequency of seller burnout, these crews are constantly looking for new sellers to bring into the spotlight. Imagine walking through what looks like an apartment building, but behind every door is a live shopping set that you can rent by the hour.\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Shopatainment-Inline-Graphics-R4_4.jpg?ssl=1\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-493 size-full\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"483\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Shopatainment-Inline-Graphics-R4_4.jpg?resize=1668%2C483&amp;ssl=1\" width=\"1668\"/></a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">COVID has accelerated the growth of shopatainment in the U.S., as retailers are forced to pursue new ways to sell to customers beyond physical stores. In addition, many shoppers have more free time to try new apps, and more influencers are looking for new ways to monetize and engage with their audiences. If the U.S. market plays out similarly to China, then we are just at the tip of the iceberg. In the coming years, I believe we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll see a video shopping revolution, one with multiple winners and a full-fledged ecosystem to support it. Just as </span><a href=\"https://a16z.com/2020/12/07/social-strikes-back-video/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">YouTube redefined TV </span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">production, shopatainment will spawn a new wave of video-first sellers, fine-tuned to online audiences and born for this moment. Shopatainment will change not just how we buy and sell, but how we unwind. In the future, we will binge-watch stores, not shows.\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n", "author": "Connie Chan"}, "191": {"podcast": "How to Build a Better Internet: 10 Principles for World leaders Shaping...", "url": "https://a16z.com/2022/01/07/how-to-build-a-better-internet-10-principles-for-world-leaders-shaping-the-future-of-web3/", "contents": "Articles.

We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve gone from barely detecting cats in YouTube videos to building cars that can drive themselves. And yet, as our aspirations for AI have become grander, it has slowly become a game that only tech giants can play. The knowledge and resources that are necessary to innovate in the space are now simply out of reach for most individuals and startups. How can we change that? The only answer is to build new technology that levels the playing field.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A common refrain in 2018 was \u00e2\u0080\u009cAI is communist; crypto is libertarian.\u00e2\u0080\u009d It was said first by Peter Thiel as a tongue-in-cheek observation that, while crypto is a technology movement that strives to decentralize power, AI is another that can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t seem to help but centralize it. This might ring true: crypto is a technology that is all about building systems that are owned and controlled by diverse communities, whereas AI today is one that relies on consolidation of data and tends to supercharge a central entity\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ability to make top-down decisions.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the past decade, this view has become our dominant narrative about AI. Nary a week goes by without headlines that bemoan the excesses of the concentrated power now wielded by tech giants and how it tragically undermines democracy, corrupts youths, causes reflux, etc. Much of society now seems to assume that the only way we can ever hope to wrest that power away from the likes of Google and Facebook is, ironically, through the exercise of yet another kind of centralized power\u00e2\u0080\u0094top-down and inevitably heavy-handed government regulation. The truth is, however, that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a monumental failure of imagination for us to believe that we are at the end of history \u00e2\u0080\u0094 that not a single path forward exists for a startup to build technology that shifts the balance of power.\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<div class=\"widget widget--subscribe widget--subscribe-inline widget--subscribe-theme-default\" data-subscribe-instance=\"1\">\n<div id=\"widget-signup-form-1\">\n<h3 class=\"widget__title\"><span>Our crypto newsletter is coming soon</span></h3>\n<p>Sign up to be the first to get it.</p>\n<div class=\"input-wrap\">\n<form class=\"mktoForm\" data-formid=\"1600\" data-forminstance=\"subscribe-inline-content-1\" data-thankyou-container=\"#widget-signup-form-1\" data-thankyou-message=\"#widget-signup-ty-1\" id=\"mktoForm-1600\" target=\"_blank\"></form>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"thankyou-message\" id=\"widget-signup-ty-1\" style=\"display: none\">\n<div class=\"thankyou-message-inner\">\n<h4>Thanks for signing up.</h4>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is almost natural to think that there is something inherent to AI that lends advantages to large players \u00e2\u0080\u0094 that AI is inescapably \u00e2\u0080\u009ccommunist.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The story that people like to tell focuses on how tech giants hoard all of our personal data and benefit from unassailable \u00e2\u0080\u009cdata network effects.\u00e2\u0080\u009d But the real reason that tech giants are good at AI is actually much simpler. They are good at it because they invest in it. They have every reason to do so. For tech giants, AI is a technology that enhances existing lines of business \u00e2\u0080\u0094 in the words of Clay Christensen, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a sustaining innovation, not a disruptive one.\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And true, there is no denying that having a lot of data does in fact lend giants an advantage. Large datasets of training examples are still a crucial input to even our most data-efficient Machine Learning algorithms, and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s unlikely to change anytime soon.

Tech giants have always solved this problem through good old-fashioned command and control. But, central planning can only go so far. There is now an opportunity for startups to coordinate human energy at an unprecedented scale by building technology that better harnesses market forces. To do that for AI, we need to build what I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll call </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Decentralized Autonomous Hiveminds</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<h2><strong>Building Robot Hiveminds</strong></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In a previous life, I worked on an effort at Google X to build a network of robots that shared a collective intelligence. Our work was part of a broader strategy to gain a data advantage by harnessing one of Google\u00e2\u0080\u0099s core strengths \u00e2\u0080\u0094 its ability to build large-scale systems. We set out to enable a collection of robots, each learning independently from its own environment, to contribute their real-time experience to a central neural network whose job it was to inform the actions of all the robots.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In other words, we wanted to build a hivemind.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To test it, we set up a door-opening challenge. Could our hivemind learn to correctly set the motor voltages for the seven joints of each robot such that each of them would successfully open the unique door that stood in front of it?\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You might think, as I did, that getting a robot to open a door would have been easy. And, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099d be right \u00e2\u0080\u0094 it is easy if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re doing it for a specific door under specific conditions. But, to this day, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a hard problem to solve for all doors under all possible circumstances. This is because there is a very long tail of variations (edge cases) in the most mundane things \u00e2\u0080\u0094 things like lighting and shadows; the color, texture, and reflectivity of the handle; the weight of the door; the type of handle; the forces required to operate it; and so on.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If there is one lesson that I took home from that experience, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s that almost all AI problems worth solving are made difficult by the challenge of the long tail \u00e2\u0080\u0094 a challenge that can only be tackled with lots of data. </span><a href=\"https://twitter.com/ali01/status/1138803418594570241\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I wrote all about that here</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<span class=\"bctt-click-to-tweet\"><span class=\"bctt-ctt-text\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https://a16z.com/2020/07/24/long-tail-problem-in-a-i/&amp;text=The%20problem%20of%20the%20long%20tail%20is%20the%20hairline%20crack%20at%20the%20foundation%20of%20today%E2%80%99s%20AI%20power%20structure.&amp;related\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">The problem of the long tail is the hairline crack at the foundation of today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s AI power structure. </a></span><a class=\"bctt-ctt-btn\" href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https://a16z.com/2020/07/24/long-tail-problem-in-a-i/&amp;text=The%20problem%20of%20the%20long%20tail%20is%20the%20hairline%20crack%20at%20the%20foundation%20of%20today%E2%80%99s%20AI%20power%20structure.&amp;related\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Click To Tweet</a></span>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The problem of the long tail is the hairline crack at the foundation of today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s AI power structure. It creates an opportunity for us to build new technology that changes the game.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To understand how this can possibly be true, we have to first grasp some of the structural limitations of A.I. today. Let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s start with this question: Why is it that, unlike human brains, our best algorithms for training deep neural networks are still so data-inefficient?</span></p>\n<h2><strong>The Limitations of Neural Networks</strong></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The truth is that today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s neural networks are fantastic interpolators but terrible extrapolators. They are powerful pattern matchers with the ability to contort themselves to fit almost any dataset, but their fitting is blind to the mechanisms that generate the data in the first place.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Neural networks do not yet engage, as humans do, in a creative search for explanatory theories that account for <em>why</em> the data is as it is. They also certainly don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t then go forth, as humans ought to, and steadily strive to falsify every last one of those creative theories until a single one emerges triumphant as the best explanation for the data observed.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A human scientist (like say, James Maxwell) makes predictions about things (like electromagnetism) by building, through an iterated process of conjecture and falsification (i.e. science), a deductive framework (Maxwell\u00e2\u0080\u0099s equations) that generalizes to future situations.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Deep neural networks, on the other hand, take a different approach to modeling reality. They stitch together thousands of linear functions, laboriously shifting each one slightly for each training example, into a kind of high dimensional quilt \u00e2\u0080\u0094 a manifold \u00e2\u0080\u0094 that fits the training set. In doing so, they cannot help but make predictions by inductively pattern-matching onto what they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen happen before. They mirror (rather than explain, as humans do) the chaos and complexity of the phenomena they observe.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Neural networks arrive at their predictions by induction, not deduction.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This helps explain why today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s deep neural networks require so much data to learn anything useful: They are inductive interpolators and, as such, they require a large number of points between which they can do their interpolating.\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<span class=\"bctt-click-to-tweet\"><span class=\"bctt-ctt-text\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https://a16z.com/2020/07/24/long-tail-problem-in-a-i/&amp;text=Why%20is%20it%20that%20our%20progress%20toward%20solving%20hard%20AI%20problems%20slows%20down%20as%20soon%20as%20we%20enter%20the%20realm%20of%20edge%20cases%3F%20The%20answer%20has%20to%20do%20with%20the%20reach%20of%20explanations.&amp;related\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Why is it that our progress toward solving hard AI problems slows down as soon as we enter the realm of edge cases?

Why is it that our progress toward solving hard A.I. problems slows down as soon as we enter the realm of edge cases? The answer has to do with the reach of explanations.\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the most remarkable things about human science, to quote <a href=\"http://www.daviddeutsch.org.uk/\">David Deutsch</a>, is \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe contrast between the enormous reach and power of our best theories and the precarious, local means by which we create them.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He says, \u00e2\u0080\u009cNo human has ever been at the surface of a star, let alone visited the core where the transmutation happens and the energy is produced. Yet we see those cold dots in our sky and <em>know</em> that we are looking at the white-hot surfaces of distant nuclear furnaces.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Human thinking somehow has the power to tell apart what is fundamental from what is merely incidental and thus can generalize to the long tail without us having to experience it directly.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To be fair, the inductive model at the heart of a deep neural network also has some power of generalization, but there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a catch. The key inductivist assumption is that the future will resemble the past and the unseen will resemble the seen. And true, sometimes it does. More often, however, the reality is otherwise. The world is radically nonlinear. One does not simply model it with a quilt of stitched-together linear functions, for, as it turns out, the future and the unseen are often unrecognizably different from the past and the seen. As a case in point, think of the inner workings at the center of a distant star whose light began its long journey towards Earth thousands of years ago. There is nothing that even remotely resembles the environment of that star here on Earth.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Without an explanation for why a pattern that so reliably holds in the common case should continue to hold in cases that are less common (the edge cases), a deep neural network\u00e2\u0080\u0099s strides become just as blind as they are confident when they venture into the long tail. The darkness of that realm, for a neural network, can be illuminated only by direct experience with it \u00e2\u0080\u0094 real training examples drawn from the long tail itself that can help mold the network\u2019s linear predilections into better fitting nonlinear ones. But, of course, those training examples are, by definition, outliers and the hardest to come across. Thus, after all of the low-hanging fruit is picked and the long tail is all that is left, the marginal cost of collecting new useful data points begins to increase.</span></p>\n<span class=\"bctt-click-to-tweet\"><span class=\"bctt-ctt-text\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https://a16z.com/2020/07/24/long-tail-problem-in-a-i/&amp;text=After%20all%20of%20the%20low-hanging%20fruit%20is%20picked%20and%20the%20long%20tail%20is%20all%20that%20is%20left%2C%20the%20marginal%20cost%20of%20collecting%20new%20useful%20data%20points%20begins%20to%20increase.&amp;related\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">After all of the low-hanging fruit is picked and the long tail is all that is left, the marginal cost of collecting new useful data points begins to increase. </a></span><a class=\"bctt-ctt-btn\" href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https://a16z.com/2020/07/24/long-tail-problem-in-a-i/&amp;text=After%20all%20of%20the%20low-hanging%20fruit%20is%20picked%20and%20the%20long%20tail%20is%20all%20that%20is%20left%2C%20the%20marginal%20cost%20of%20collecting%20new%20useful%20data%20points%20begins%20to%20increase.&amp;related\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Click To Tweet</a></span>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Think of what it takes to train a large neural network today. As our applications for A.I. become more ambitious and our networks grow deeper and wider, the whole enterprise becomes primarily about tracking down \u00e2\u0080\u0094 in the most unlikely of places \u00e2\u0080\u0094 data that offers differentiated signal. This is why it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a problem of complex coordination.

The great irony, however, is that a hivemind is supposed to emerge <em>bottom up</em> as a unified intelligence that integrates the countless impulses of each of its far-flung agents. The \u201chivemind\u201d that I worked on wasn\u2019t like that at all. Every aspect of it \u00e2\u0080\u0094 every line of code written, every resource deployed \u00e2\u0080\u0094 was controlled by us. It was a centralized system pretending to be a decentralized one \u00e2\u0080\u0094 a somewhat \u00e2\u0080\u009ccommunist\u00e2\u0080\u009d simulacrum of a hivemind.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But what if such intelligence </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">could</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> actually emerge bottom up? What if it could be born, not from the efforts of just one company, but from the aggregate knowledge of countless people working independently from far afield to contribute diverse signal to the collective?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Enter crypto.</span></p>\n<h2><strong>A Decentralized World Computer</strong></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At its heart, crypto is a tech movement that offers us new tools for the bottom-up governance of large systems. The very term \u00e2\u0080\u009cdecentralization\u00e2\u0080\u009d in the space refers to a class of power structures whose balance is tilted in favor of communities instead of central points of control.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The tools for decentralization that crypto has brought to bear have led us to build a kind of logical \u201cworld computer.\u201d It is made up of a distributed network of physical machines that are owned and operated by members of a broad community. Ethereum is the first example of such a computer. It extended the ideas behind Bitcoin by including support for a general purpose programming language. Since then, it has unquestionably become one of the most important projects in the space.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But why is this kind of computer even useful?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What is truly novel about this mode of computation is that its security and trust model emerges bottom up from its users \u00e2\u0080\u0094 users who can be anyone, anywhere, and can participate without anyone\u00e2\u0080\u0099s permission. Control over this collective computer is literally decentralized. There are no gatekeepers.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The challenge is, of course, that many of those users are no doubt dishonest and would rather like to game the system for profit if they could. The genius at the heart of Ethereum and Bitcoin (and crypto more generally) is a set of incentive structures that makes these systems self-policing. Through well-calibrated economic rewards, cryptonetworks like Ethereum encourage their users to keep one another in check. And so, even though they may not trust one another, they can come to trust in the decentralized computer that they are collectively helping secure.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The defining property of such a computer is therefore that everyone can come to trust (and verify) that the programs that are deployed to it will indeed run and will run correctly <em>as written</em> no matter what. This is why these programs have come to be known as \u201csmart contracts.\u201d\u00c2\u00a0 A better term for them, however, might be \u201csovereign programs\u201d because, once deployed, they are independent \u00e2\u0080\u0094 they deterministically execute themselves, instruction by instruction, subject to nobody\u2019s authority. They run with immunity from intervention by (1) the people who originally wrote them; (2) the people who interact with them while they are running; and (3) even the people who control the physical machines that execute them.</span></p>\n<div class=\"widget widget--subscribe widget--subscribe-inline widget--subscribe-theme-default\" data-subscribe-instance=\"2\">\n<div id=\"widget-signup-form-2\">\n<h3 class=\"widget__title\"><span>Our crypto newsletter is coming soon</span></h3>\n<p>Sign up to be the first to get it.</p>\n<div class=\"input-wrap\">\n<form class=\"mktoForm\" data-formid=\"1600\" data-forminstance=\"subscribe-inline-content-2\" data-thankyou-container=\"#widget-signup-form-2\" data-thankyou-message=\"#widget-signup-ty-2\" id=\"mktoForm-1600\" target=\"_blank\"></form>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"thankyou-message\" id=\"widget-signup-ty-2\" style=\"display: none\">\n<div class=\"thankyou-message-inner\">\n<h4>Thanks for signing up.</h4>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is this inviolable sovereignty that allows a smart contract to credibly act as a trusted intermediary between strangers. In fact, it is exactly this property that empowers a single program \u00e2\u0080\u0094 e.g. the Bitcoin codebase \u00e2\u0080\u0094 to come alive as a fully digital, global store of value. But that\u2019s just the beginning. Smart contracts are a fundamentally new computational building block that is very general. They unlock a realm of possible applications that we have barely begun to explore. A few of them might even have something to do with A.I.!</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is, in fact, a coincidence that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s worthy of good sci-fi that, as a considerable subset of humanity finds itself doggedly working toward strong AI, another subset (conveniently disjoint from the first) is set on building an unstoppable world computer. Can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t make this stuff up!</span></p>\n<h2><strong>Crypto and Two-Sided Markets</strong></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fanciful joking aside, let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s imagine for a second if we could take a smart contract and embed within it a deep neural network. No need to make it Skynet. Let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s instead think through a network that is dead simple \u00e2\u0080\u0094 say, a classifier that accepts as input an image and produces as output a prediction of what it thinks the image contains (e.g. \u00e2\u0080\u009ccar,\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cdog,\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009choney badger,\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe number three,\u00e2\u0080\u009d etc.).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the beginning, our model will be untrained, so it won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be very useful. Training it would normally require us to collect (or somehow already have on hand) a broad corpus of labeled data that is representative of the kinds of images that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099d like our model to do well on. And, let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not forget, if there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s any hope that our model will be able to perform well across the board, this dataset of training examples must include images that come straight from the long tail. The many exotic variations of each object must somehow be represented.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We could, of course, do what Google usually does and scour the Earth, brute force, for all of the right data \u00e2\u0080\u0094 labeled images of the many kinds of cars, dogs, and honey badgers in all sorts of funky poses and lighting conditions. But, let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s be real, that playbook is old news. A new playbook is to harness market forces. Instead of exhaustively turning over every last stone in search of bits, we could enlist a broader community to collect the data for us.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The trick is to create a two-sided market by building the right incentive structures into our smart contract. On the supply side, people who have access to the prized bits of data can get paid if they contribute them (in labeled form) to our nascent neural net. And, on the demand side, developers who would like to leverage the intelligence of our neural net can pay a fee to make use of it as an API and get its prediction for what some unknown image contains (again \u00e2\u0080\u009ccar,\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009choney badger,\u00e2\u0080\u009d etc.).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once this kind of economic venue is bootstrapped and reaches critical mass, it sets off a self-reinforcing feedback loop of improvement: More capital deployed by our neural net leads to the crowdsourcing of more esoteric data, which leads to improved model accuracy, which leads to increasing demand from developers, which leads to even more capital deployed by our neural net. And around the flywheel we go.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s dive into how exactly we could get this to work.</span></p>\n<h2><strong>Solving the Cold-Start Problem</strong></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The first hard problem is getting our marketplace off the ground. Why should a willing supply side show up with data, if the demand side doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t already exist? And, contrariwise, why would the demand side ever pay good money for the mad ravings of an untrained neural network? The cold-start problem is the key challenge that every startup to have ever bootstrapped a multi-sided market, like Airbnb or Uber, has had to overcome. A minimum level of activation energy is required to spark the virtuous engine into motion.\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This initial energy must come from somewhere. Traditionally, it has always come from financial capital \u00e2\u0080\u0094 venture funding that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s provided by a set of people that tends to be completely disjoint from the set of participants in the network itself. Companies like Uber and Airbnb have historically raised enormous amounts of money to subsidize one or both sides of their marketplaces with cash in order to get the flywheel started. This is capital-intensive and misses a huge opportunity.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Imagine for a second a world in which Uber had raised less money than it did and, instead of subsidizing the supply side of its new marketplace with only cash, it had also rewarded early drivers with a small amount of ownership in Uber (the company). In that world, the very first Uber drivers would no doubt appreciate the fact that their hard-earned ownership stake in Uber (albeit small, at first) could someday be worth a lot of money. Could that fact alone help persuade some of them to participate? How much more loyal would those drivers be to Uber over some of its competitors? Would they be more likely to evangelize Uber to other people? And, as Uber grew and each driver\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ownership began to be worth real money, would it inspire the next cohort of drivers to jump onboard?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yes.</span></p>\n<span class=\"bctt-click-to-tweet\"><span class=\"bctt-ctt-text\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https://a16z.com/2020/07/24/long-tail-problem-in-a-i/&amp;text=There%20is%20no%20reason%20that%20the%20capital%20needed%20to%20get%20a%20multi-sided%20marketplace%20off%20the%20ground%20has%20to%20be%20entirely%20financial%20in%20nature%20and%20come%20from%20external%20sources.&amp;related\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">There is no reason that the capital needed to get a multi-sided marketplace off the ground has to be entirely financial in nature and come from external sources. </a></span><a class=\"bctt-ctt-btn\" href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https://a16z.com/2020/07/24/long-tail-problem-in-a-i/&amp;text=There%20is%20no%20reason%20that%20the%20capital%20needed%20to%20get%20a%20multi-sided%20marketplace%20off%20the%20ground%20has%20to%20be%20entirely%20financial%20in%20nature%20and%20come%20from%20external%20sources.&amp;related\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Click To Tweet</a></span>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is a fundamentally more efficient capital structure for a multi-sided market.

As in our thought experiment involving Uber, our contract can begin subsidizing the supply side of its nascent marketplace, not just with cash, but also with newly minted tokens of ownership.\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With this new bit of logic, our neural network begins to take on a life of its own as a self-funding, autonomous entity. And, as the flywheel is set into motion, the service it offers will begin to become useful to the demand side too \u00e2\u0080\u0094 i.e., developers willing to pay real money for its predictions. Of course, the fees that our contract charges them would have to be small at the start, but as our model\u00e2\u0080\u0099s accuracy improves, they can begin to increase. Higher fees can then be used to further incentivize data contributions which, in turn, improve the model, and so again, around the flywheel we go.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The key idea is that a market that is owned by its participants acts on its region of influence like a magnetic coil does on iron filings. It is a force of alignment between people \u00e2\u0080\u0094 a force that revs the market engine by its shaft at its crucial starting moment.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s call these things Autonomous Marketplaces.</span></p>\n<h2><strong>What are the Technical Hurdles?</strong></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There is no question that getting our decentralized neural net to work will also require us to solve a whole host of hard, technical problems. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll briefly mention a few.\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We must, for example, build into our smart contract a mechanism that can reliably measure signal in the data that is contributed to it. It must have logic that is capable of telling apart garbage data from the real thing.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A possible solution is to enable our smart contract to access a secret benchmark dataset that it can use to measure its own performance. Data contributions that improve the neural net\u00e2\u0080\u0099s accuracy on the benchmark can be rewarded, whereas those that don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t might incur a fee.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A related problem is that, because the state of all smart contracts today is visible on the blockchain to anyone who wishes to look, it would be trivial for an attacker to steal the underlying neural net (once trained) and bypass the need to pay for its predictions.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The solution to this whole family of problems depends on the existence of smart contracts whose execution is still verifiable by anyone, but whose internal state is encrypted. Such programs are called \u00e2\u0080\u009cprivate smart contracts,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and they are an active area of research in the space. One approach to building them is based on a kind of cryptographic proof (known as a zk-SNARK) that can mathematically convince any observer that a computation was performed correctly without revealing any of the underlying state. And, there are many other approaches in the works.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The challenges are formidable, but solutions are well underway.</span></p>\n<h2><strong>Extending the Internet</strong></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When all is said and done, our neural network will be an autonomous entity in the world whose intelligence will have emerged from the grassroots efforts of countless individuals who are laboring independently to discover and contribute signal from wherever they may be.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We will have built a Decentralized Autonomous Hivemind \u00e2\u0080\u0094 a hivemind that is true to form and, unlike the one I worked on at Google, would make the eight-year-old boy inside of me proud. And, from there, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s but a small leap to imagine a future that includes a vast and open ecosystem of countless such hiveminds, each one brought to life by its own community and serving as a modular building block that anyone, large or small, can use to build products.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The aggregate of all those building blocks can thus begin to emerge as a new protocol layer that extends the capabilities of the internet itself. It will be a fabric of intelligence that, like the internet, will be open source and controlled collectively by its own community.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In fact, it is precisely because control over such a network will be decentralized that it has the potential to scale to millions of developers and contributors. No platform ever gets to that scale without making an ironclad commitment to uphold its own promises over time. And there is no better way for a platform to make that guarantee than by engraving its own rules into a sovereign program that is owned and governed by the very people who build on top of it.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is, after all, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/cdixon/status/965268012621217792\">Why Decentralization Matters</a>. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The core idea behind Chris Dixon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s argument is that decentralization \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and therefore crypto \u00e2\u0080\u0094 matters because it addresses the problem of platform risk. History is full of countless forgotten companies that were tempted to build entirely on top of centralized platforms. For many of those companies, everything tended to look great until, like quicksand, the platform\u00e2\u0080\u0099s rules began to shift. Rules that were once generous to developers conveniently morphed into ones that are now more favorable to the platform. Along the way, entire companies have been dragged down by the undertow, often beneath the suffocating sand.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is because the core protocols of the internet (i.e. TCP/IP) are decentralized, that it is possible for trillion-dollar companies like Google to be built on top of them. By that same token, it is inconceivable that a company the size of Google could be built on top of Google, in the same way that Google was built on top of TCP/IP.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What might it be possible to build on top of a decentralized network of market-powered neural nets?</span></p>\n<h2><strong>The Power of Markets</strong></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s go back to the question that we started with. Why should an approach that is driven by market forces fare any better at covering the long tail of AI than the centrally planned, somewhat \u00e2\u0080\u009ccommunist\u00e2\u0080\u009d efforts of a trillion-dollar tech giant? How can this new approach possibly win?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Remember that the challenge that forces even striding giants to slow down as they stumble headlong into the vast stretches of the long tail has less to do with blunt resources to be brought to bear than with the need to navigate problems of complex coordination. Such problems are made difficult for a central planner by the fact that the information needed to solve them is strewn about widely and locked away in countless remote places and unknown minds.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The people who are best equipped to harness the various pockets of localized knowledge that these problems demand are those who are closest to those pockets, not the monolithic entity at the center that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s trying to do all of the planning and commanding top-down. So, rather than marshaling an army that searches the world over blindly, it is much more effective to instead create incentive structures that encourage individuals to self-organize.</span></p>\n<span class=\"bctt-click-to-tweet\"><span class=\"bctt-ctt-text\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https://a16z.com/2020/07/24/long-tail-problem-in-a-i/&amp;text=Rather%20than%20marshaling%20an%20army%20that%20searches%20the%20world%20over%20blindly%20for%20long-tail%20data%2C%20it%20is%20much%20more%20effective%20to%20instead%20create%20incentive%20structures%20that%20encourage%20individuals%20to%20self-organize.&amp;related\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Rather than marshaling an army that searches the world over blindly for long-tail data, it is much more effective to instead create incentive structures that encourage individuals to self-organize. </a></span><a class=\"bctt-ctt-btn\" href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https://a16z.com/2020/07/24/long-tail-problem-in-a-i/&amp;text=Rather%20than%20marshaling%20an%20army%20that%20searches%20the%20world%20over%20blindly%20for%20long-tail%20data%2C%20it%20is%20much%20more%20effective%20to%20instead%20create%20incentive%20structures%20that%20encourage%20individuals%20to%20self-organize.&amp;related\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Click To Tweet</a></span>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is true because there is simply no way that a single mind (or a small group of minds) at the center can match the endless knowledge and creativity of a diverse ecosystem of people who are all aligned with one another by the presence of a well calibrated market. Adam Smith\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009cinvisible hand of the market\u00e2\u0080\u009d is, after all, but a metaphor for the power of bottom-up self-organization.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Today, the knowledge and resources that are necessary to innovate in AI are held in the pockets of giants \u00e2\u0080\u0094 well beyond the reach of most individuals and startups. But, through the creation of efficient and global markets around them, they can be made more accessible. We might discover that market-based systems that are built bottom-up offer society a new approach, one that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s more disruptive to entrenched power structures, for building intelligent computer systems. The difference will be in who ends up controlling them.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Each new mini-hivemind may start out modestly. But, the right set of incentives, credibly engraved into a kind of covenant whose governance is decentralized (a smart contract), has the potential to coordinate human energy at a scale that dwarfs even that of our largest giants. And so, in the end, it may turn out that AI is not so inherently communist after all.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">***</p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The views expressed here are those of the individual AH Capital Management, L.L.C.

For hundreds of hours of gameplay, you can control the soldiers, prevent them from getting flanked, and battle heroic generals 1:1 on the field. It\u2019s super fun and has sucked up an incredible amount of my time.\u00e2\u0080\u009d</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/brawl-stars.jpg?ssl=1\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-289854 alignright\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"300\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/brawl-stars.jpg?resize=225%2C300&amp;ssl=1\" width=\"225\"/></a></p>\n<p><strong><em>Brawl Stars </em></strong><strong>(videogame). </strong>\u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is the cutest, most engaging, on-the-go eSports experience you can possibly have. It\u2019s incredibly easy and fun to play, and I especially recommend it for those who think <em>Fortnite</em> is too hard. In <em>Brawl Stars</em>, you play as an upgradeable character like Shelly, a shotgun-toting badass lady, to El Primo, a Mexican wrestler, or dozens of other characters. Team up in a 3 v 3 battle. It\u2019s also worth paying to upgrade your characters if you can.\u201d</p>\n<h3>\u2026from Sonal Chokshi, editorial team:</h3>\n<p><em><strong>Booksmart </strong></em><strong>(film)</strong><em><strong>.</strong></em> \u201cThis movie \u2014 made on a budget, relatively speaking, in a directorial debut for Olivia Wilde \u2014 is so damn good and laugh out loud funny! It is a modern update on the last-day-of-high-school genre of film (including many scenes from the back of a Lyft), yet is wonderfully poignant for all adults. It\u2019s about friendship; defining yourself vs. letting others define you; and life as a series of \u2018seminal fun anecdotes\u2019\u2026 I loved the soundtrack, too!\u201d</p>\n<p><strong><em>Jessica Jones</em> (tv series).</strong> \u201cNetflix ended its Marvel series \u2014 including <em>Daredevil</em>, <em>Iron Fist</em>, <em>Jessica Jones</em>, <em>Luke Cage</em>, <em>The Punisher</em>, and ultimate crossover event <em>The Defenders</em> \u2014 with the third season of this show. But in a weird way, this might have been my favorite of all because of <em>how</em> it ended. Everybody has a Kilgrave (season 1) in their head, even if it\u2019s your own demons; and surely we all know a Pryce Cheng (season 2) in every workplace, too? So for Jessica to become, well, truly <em>herself </em>through all of that \u2014 and separating from a progressive series of loved ones too \u2014 was perfect. I not only loved how the show was centered around strong female characters beyond the archetypes, but how it also twisted and turned the archetypical notion of a hero\u2019s journey (especially in this last season). Finally, it\u2019s an amazing example of franchise storytelling, which I strongly believe will continue to define the future of media.\u201d</p>\n<p><strong><em>The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel</em> (tv series).</strong> Some people may, ahem, <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/12/24/the-cloying-fantasia-of-the-marvelous-mrs-maisel\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">describe this show</a>\u00c2\u00a0as a \u201ccloying fantasia\u201d, but for me, that was the very thing \u2014 at least on the feminist front (I can\u2019t speak to the other cultural aspects of the show) \u2014 that allowed it to <em>better</em> convey its messages. I\u2019ve also devotedly followed every single Sherman-Palladino show (including of course <em>Gilmore Girls</em>, which I frequently reference:), so if there\u2019s one thing I know, it\u2019s that the Palladino\u2019s work may seem fun on the surface\u2026 but is also subtly subversive. In fact, that saturated sense of color and character may be orchestrated to convey other things to the viewer without them really knowing it, or having to be hit on the head with it, as with shows like <em>Handmaid\u2019s Tale </em>(which provoked such anxiety I had to sadly stop watching it). My favorite episode was in season 2, where Midge (Mrs. Maisel) goes to the backroom with an artist at his invitation; there\u2019s all kinds of telling things that didn\u2019t happen in that moment, even as it played out across the broader backdrop of her relationship with her new boyfriend. What happens when a woman takes center stage?\u201d</p>\n<p><strong><em>Untitled Goose Game</em> (videogame).</strong> \u201cI played this game last year at XOXO and was instantly in love: what a fun, quirky game reminiscent of all those Atari games I played <a href=\"https://twitter.com/smc90/status/1016902364836425728\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">as a kid</a>! But this isn\u2019t nostalgia genre (though it does have the basic-palette design of retro games made new). It\u2019s a game about a mischievous goose with lists of tasks you, the player, need to check off for it to wreak havoc in a farmer\u2019s dell. I can\u2019t tell you how excited I am that this is coming to Switch, and especially to Panic\u2019s new Playdate too (you bet your a%&amp; I ordered that thing the moment it came out)!\u201d</p>\n<h3><strong>\u00e2\u0080\u00a6from Joel de la Garza, operating partner, information security:</strong></h3>\n<p><strong><em>\u00c2\u00a0U</em></strong><strong><em>pstairs at Eric\u2019s </em></strong><strong>by Yaz (song). </strong>\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat\u2019s old is new again.

What trends are you seeing in the sales funnel?\u00c2\u00a0</strong></h3>\n<p>From talking with a number of CROs and founders, we estimate companies are seeing about a 30% drop in upfront cash, as actual payments are being delayed or deferred, and total contract value (TCV) is lower. Pipeline is also down dramatically, particularly in companies that have sales-led prospecting, and deals are becoming more complicated, as CFOs and other executives become more involved in procurement, even for smaller deals.</p>\n<p>Generally, these trends correspond to an impact on annual contract value (ACV) bookings and the topline. While we see renewal rates relative to bookings and channel deals are slightly up, these typically do not make up for the drop in topline. And companies with direct, multi-stage sales are being hit the hardest. If you can do bottoms-up, product-led, inside sales selling or remote selling, now is probably the time to invest there.</p>\n<p><strong>Go deeper wit</strong>h<em>:</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://a16z.com/2019/08/09/video-growth-sales-and-a-new-era-of-b2b/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Growth, Sales &amp; a New Era of B2B</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><em>-Martin Casado</em></p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Selling-Under-COVID-19-Deck-for-Martin-1.png?ssl=1\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-300818\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"540\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Selling-Under-COVID-19-Deck-for-Martin-1.png?resize=960%2C540&amp;ssl=1\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Selling-Under-COVID-19-Deck-for-Martin-1.png?w=960&amp;ssl=1 960w, https://i2.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Selling-Under-COVID-19-Deck-for-Martin-1.png?resize=300%2C169&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Selling-Under-COVID-19-Deck-for-Martin-1.png?resize=768%2C432&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Selling-Under-COVID-19-Deck-for-Martin-1.png?resize=125%2C70&amp;ssl=1 125w, https://i2.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Selling-Under-COVID-19-Deck-for-Martin-1.png?resize=740%2C416&amp;ssl=1 740w, https://i2.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Selling-Under-COVID-19-Deck-for-Martin-1.png?resize=587%2C330&amp;ssl=1 587w\" width=\"960\"/></a></h3>\n<h3 id=\"q2\"><strong>2.

How do you build funnel and do demand generation when you can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t hold in-person events?</h3>\n<p>Lean into the fact that virtual events require less for attendees to join. A virtual conference, if well executed, can result in larger numbers and more leads. According to Charles Race, President of Worldwide Field Operations at Okta, Okta\u00e2\u0080\u0099s annual conference Oktane typically draws 4,000-5,000 attendees to San Francisco. This year, they flipped the event to virtual and had over 20,000 people attend, generating over 4,000 leads. Okta has since switched 50 planned in-person events to 70 virtual events.</p>\n<p>Race points out though, that the pipeline from virtual events may not progress the same as a traditional pipeline.

How should I balance holding customers accountable to contracted commitments versus being understanding that the customer context has changed (e.g. projects are on hold, applicable users are reduced) and taking a loss on anticipated revenues and ACB (adjusted cost base)?</strong></h3>\n<p>You want to solve for long-term customer success. In a subscription business, it isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t recurring revenue until the revenue actually recurs, and in a downturn, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s easier to retain a customer and renew and expand an existing account than to acquire a new customer. Extending flexibility to customers, when you can, will win you customer loyalty and referrals in the long-term, assuming you can deliver successfully.</p>\n<p>When renegotiating or changing contract terms, factor in that most subscription businesses are priced on a perceived basis, and whatever perceived price you hold will dictate what prices you can charge in the future and determine your total addressable market (TAM). If possible, look to other levers beyond price \u00e2\u0080\u0093 flexible payment terms of additional professional services \u00e2\u0080\u0093 rather than change the perceived price. As customers tighten budgets, we\u2019re seeing a number of cases where customers simply can\u2019t pay, particularly in hard hit sectors like travel and retail. In some cases, we are seeing cash deferrals of up to nine months.</p>\n<p>Once one sales person gives something away to close a deal, an incentive for a specific deal can quickly become the new standard for all deals. We recommend implementing a deal desk, usually in the form of a mailing list or a chain of sign-off for deals over a certain threshold, to maintain deal structure around incentives and discounts to prevent reps giving away too much.</p>\n<p><strong>Go deeper with:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://a16z.com/2019/07/17/16-sales-contract-clauses-to-balance-risk-and-reward/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">16 Sales Contract Clauses to Balance Risk &amp; Reward</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://a16z.com/2020/05/29/a16z-podcast-saas-go-to-upmarket/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">The SaaS Go-to-Upmarket</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://a16z.com/2018/03/12/services-enterprise-software-products-startups/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">The Case for Services in Enterprise Software Startups</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><em>-Martin Casado, Peter Levine, and Kristina Shen</em></p>\n<h2>Sales Quotas &amp; Comp</h2>\n<h3 id=\"q9\"><strong>9.

Eventually, your psychology will get to the point where you start making silly mistakes. You don\u2019t listen carefully. You\u2019re not patient. You press too hard.</p>\n<p>You need to support your sales team in keeping their confidence high and that starts with a reasonable plan and then having an understanding of what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going on in these cycles. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a fluid situation, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not something anyone is able to predict, so focus on keeping your team in a place where they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to be effective.</p>\n<p>Charles Race at Okta suggests not lowering quotas to the same extent as the forecast. \u00e2\u0080\u009cLook for around 90% delivery of quota. If quotas are too low and everyone is making 300% of their number, it will cost you a fortune, but if you set quotas too high, then you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll see attrition. If you do feel that attainment is low and attrition could peak, you can always put quota reduction spiffs in place to help mitigate the actual risk on the individual earning money, but you don\u2019t want to put yourself in a position where A) it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy because you lowered the number, you\u2019re never going to get it back up again, or B) that things do pick up, and you have to increase the quotas again.\u00e2\u0080\u009d</p>\n<p>And COVID-19 aside, there is never going to be a year where the plan that you set out three to six months before the year started still holds true 18 months later. If you are still doing annual planning, this is the time to shift to a four-quarter rolling plan, where every quarter you project four quarters out. This will allow you to scale territories and capacity up or down, based on where you are seeing opportunity and where you are seeing pain.</p>\n<p><strong>Go deeper with:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://a16z.com/2018/09/10/sales-number-quotas-forecasting/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Setting the Sales Number</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://a16z.com/2018/09/07/sales-quotas-company-planning/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">A Short Coda on (Sales) Quotas</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><em>-Ben Horowitz</em></p>\n<h3 id=\"q10\">10. What about sales compensation? Should we put our sales reps on a draw?</h3>\n<p>A draw functions almost as a forgivable loan for sales reps, so in a downturn, reps on a draw receive their on-target earnings (i.e. full base plus commission), even if they don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t hit their quota. The upside of a draw is that sales reps have a steadier income stream, and when the market recovers, they can pay it off with a good quarter.</p>\n<p>However, a draw only works if you are confident your business is going to recover. So, before moving to a draw, do the cash planning to figure out, for the worst case scenario, what makes sense as a comp plan for reps.</p>\n<p>And if you do a draw, you can still tie it to objectives. While organizations are used to paying for revenue or bookings, during COVID-19, it may make more sense to pay for other activities \u00e2\u0080\u0093 how many people did a rep contact, how many new pipeline prospects did they generate.

Should I move from a quarterly to monthly quota to better monitor things?</h3>\n<p>This really depends on the size of deals and how long it generally takes to close deals. Monthly quotas typically work well if you are doing $20k or $30k deals over the phone. But if you are doing $500k deals that can take months to close, and that deal slips out of this month, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no incentive to go after it. In that case, a monthly quota is likely to create chaos.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><em>-Peter Levine</em></p>\n<h3 id=\"q12\">12. If we are reducing headcount, how should we realign the sales force?</h3>\n<p>Generally, you want to consolidate or remap territories to eliminate underperforming geographies and better group accounts. The key questions to ask: What sort of pipeline coverage do different reps have? What stages of the pipeline are different accounts in? Is there any clustering of accounts where it would make sense to combine territories? Are there territories that naturally align by vertical? Does it make sense to switch some geographies from direct sales to channel sales because a partner has existing relationships with prospects?</p>\n<p>And again, a rolling plan will allow for flexibility in staffing. Okta, for instance, releases headcount two quarters out so they have the flexibility to put it where they need it, rather than just backfilling the same role in the same place.</p>\n<p><strong>Go deeper with:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://a16z.com/2018/09/17/sales-productivity/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Sales Force Productivity: How Do You Know?</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><em>-Peter Levine</em></p>\n<h2>Verticals, Channels, and Territories</h2>\n<h3 id=\"q13\">13.

For those early in the market, you may have been working with the scrappier, more boutique channel partners who can do lead gen and who understand your business. However, these smaller partners are often fighting to acquire customers in much the same way that you are. Partners who don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have to do prospecting but can pull you into existing relationships are typically the better partners, and this may mean shifting your channel strategy to more established players who have the relationship and account control to actually help you establish the relationship.</p>\n<p><strong>Go deeper with: </strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://a16z.com/2018/03/03/distribution-sales-channels/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Distribution and Sales Channels</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://a16z.com/2018/09/04/sales-channels/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Understanding and Defining Sales Channels</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><em>-Martin Casado</em></p>\n<h3 id=\"q14\">14.

Once you see that pull from the field, you can match up your sellers with their sellers, identify the accounts they\u2019re in that want your functionality, and then do the integration that the sales people want.</p>\n<p>When negotiating the terms of the partnership, avoid entering into an exclusive arrangement.

How are different geographies responding to COVID-19?</h3>\n<p>How geographies are responding is very situationally dependent, and the performance relevant to your business is probably more of an indication of the mix of channel and go to market than of the actual market conditions. For instance, I have seen a number of companies do better in Europe, not because the European market is in a better place than the U.S., but because they use partner channel sales in Europe. Similarly, I have seen companies do better in Latin America because they have a lower annual contract value and are using inside sales, while in North America, direct sales is chasing larger deals.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><em>-Martin Casado</em></p>\n<h3 id=\"q16\">16. How do I think about the changes in which verticals are buying versus the verticals that pre-COVID made up our primary market?</h3>\n<p>Think about it as vertical discovery. As new opportunities come in \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and if you have incoming right now, you should absolutely take it \u00e2\u0080\u0093 use that to inform your vertical strategy and learn where there is good product-market fit and the best way to sell into new verticals.</p>\n<p>Overall, my impression has been that higher margin businesses with more comfort in their cash position are more likely to still be buying. Financial services and gaming sectors seem to still be buying pretty aggressively. Media is still buying, but more flat, whereas retail, hospitality, advertising are just really rough right now. In the health and life sciences sectors, hospitals are under tremendous pressure because their profits come from elective care, and that\u2019s gone very quickly to zero, so if it isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t directly related to COVID-19, it will probably be hard to sell there. But in life sciences and research, there is still a lot of buying going on.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><em>-Ben Horowitz</em></p>\n<p>The bottom line is that COVID-19 is a health crisis, and the timeline for economic recovery will depend on the timeline for a vaccine. For B2B companies, this means preparing for the worst case scenario and planning what you will do if that happens, while also recognizing that with this disruption comes the opportunity for new incumbents, new technology, and new ways of working.</p>\n<p><em>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS: Special thanks to Charles Race of Okta, Amanda Kleha of Figma, and Kaushik Shirhatti of NVIDIA for contributing their experience and expertise.</em></p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>image: <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/\">Unsplash</a> | <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/photos/C8jNJslQM3A\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">@timmossholder</a></p>\n<p><em>The views expressed here are those of the individual AH Capital Management, L.L.C.

Recently, that path has shifted from enterprise networks to you and your devices for two reasons. First, <span style=\"font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif\">as we have built more secure software and systems, it has made it harder to attack enterprise networks. At the same time, we have started to access more sensitive information, both personal and professional, on our phones.\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>That isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t to say enterprise security, isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t important \u00e2\u0080\u0093 it still is. But individual cybersecurity is now a critical part of enterprise security because when individual workers aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t secure, the enterprise isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t either.</p>\n<p>In the current era of cybersecurity, your life is part of the attack surface. In this post, we lay out 16 practical steps you can take to secure your data, accounts, and devices. The list is prioritized by risk reduction, so start at #1 and work your way down.</p>\n<h2>THE BASICS: 4 Steps &amp; 3 Habits to address 99% of your online risk.</h2>\n<p>These first seven tips are the security basics. If you do nothing else, these tips \u00e2\u0080\u0093 many of which you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve probably heard for years \u00e2\u0080\u0093 will protect you against the most common attacks.</p>\n<h3><strong>1) Implement two-factor authentication (2FA)\u2026 and not with your cell phone!</strong></h3>\n<p>Our first two tips are the most important to protect yourself against the most common security breach: password theft.</p>\n<p>Two-factor authentication (2FA) creates two layers of security to access online accounts or information. There are a number of options for 2FA, and not all are created equal. At a16z, we believe hardware is the strongest form of 2FA because it requires possession of a physical object to access your account. For instance, I use a password and a Yubikey (a small device that plugs into a computer port) to access my work accounts, such as email or my HR system. My password is the first authentication; the Yubikey is the second.</p>\n<p>SMS or text message-based authentication\u00c2\u00a0 is a very weak choice for 2FA. Using SMS as an authentication (e.g. when your bank account texts you a verification code) leaves you vulnerable to SIM jacking, also known as SIM swapping attacks. In these attacks, a hacker convinces your mobile provider to reroute your phone number to their device. They can then access information and accounts linked to that phone.</p>\n<p>SIM jacking is on the rise, and on September 17, 2019, the <a href=\"https://www.sc.edu/study/colleges_schools/law/centers/cybersecurity/_docs/fbi_cyber_pin/2019/fbi_pin-20190917_multi-factor_authentication.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">FBI even issued a formal warning</a> about the risk of SMS-based authentication. If you do want to use your phone as a 2FA, Duo and Google WebAuthn are mobile-based 2FAs that do not rely on SMS and are less vulnerable to SIM swapping.</p>\n<p><strong>NEXT STEP: Add a second authentication method (not SMS!).</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.yubico.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Yubikey</a> \u00e2\u0080\u0093 hardware key that plugs into your computer</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://duo.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Duo</a> \u00e2\u0080\u0093 mobile-phone based authentication that doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t use SMS</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.google.com/intl/en/landing/2step/#tab=how-it-protects\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Google WebAuthn</a> \u00e2\u0080\u0093 mobile-phone based authentication that doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t use SMS</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>2) Use a password manager.</h3>\n<p>Most of us have the terrible habit of reusing the same password on multiple sites. In <a href=\"https://a16z.com/2019/07/25/passwords-are-dead-again/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Passwords are Dead\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Again</a>, I explained how this reuse creates a web of risk if your password is stolen. Even when we know the risk, many of us reuse passwords because it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just too hard to remember different passwords for all of our different online accounts. Even worse, we tend to choose passwords that are easy for hackers to guess or figure out.</p>\n<p>That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s where a password manager can help. Password managers secure each account with a unique, complex password and store each of these passwords, so that you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have to remember them.</p>\n<p><strong>NEXT STEP: Start using a password manager, such as <a href=\"https://1password.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">1Password</a>, <a href=\"https://www.lastpass.com/hp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">LastPass</a>, <a href=\"https://www.dashlane.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">DashLane</a>.</strong></p>\n<h3>3) Patch your sh*t!</h3>\n<p>The<a href=\"https://enterprise.verizon.com/resources/reports/2019-data-breach-investigations-report.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> second most common cause of security breaches</a> are missing security patches. No software is perfectly secure. Many updates are released to address newly discovered security gaps or bugs. When you receive a notification from your phone or computer that an update is available, install it as soon as possible. Or even better automate updates so that as soon as software or system updates are available, they are installed. In particular, the three most important systems to keep patched are: 1) your computer operating system, usually Windows or MacOS; 2) your browser, such as Chrome, Internet Explorer, or Safari; 3) your mobile operating system, usually Android or iOS.</p>\n<p><strong>NEXT STEP: Check that the following systems and software are fully up-to-date and automate patches.</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12373/windows-update-faq\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Windows OS</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/get-macos-updates-mchlpx1065/mac\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">MacOS</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95414?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&amp;hl=en\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Chrome</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/internet-explorer/ie11-deploy-guide/ie11-delivery-through-automatic-updates\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Internet Explorer</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://support.google.com/googleplay/answer/113412?hl=en\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Android</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204204\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">IoS</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>4) Review cloud, social, and financial security/privacy settings.</h3>\n<p>Cloud configuration isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t just important to the enterprise (see the blog <a href=\"https://a16z.com/2019/08/22/the-next-generation-of-cloud-security-startups/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">The Next Generation of Cloud Security Startups</a>). Each of us needs to be aware of how we set up and configure our security and privacy settings for any cloud and SaaS applications that we use. The three most important here are cloud storage, social media accounts, and financial applications. Most of these tools provide security and privacy wizards that make it easy to check and configure your settings.</p>\n<p><strong>NEXT STEP: Check your privacy and security for cloud storage, social media, and finance tools that you use. Below are links to some of the most common.</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://myaccount.google.com/privacycheckup\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Google Privacy Checkup</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/account#security\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Dropbox Security Settings</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.latest.facebook.com/help/443357099140264?helpref=about_content\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook Privacy Checkup</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>5) Trust but verify digital communications.</h3>\n<p>At my peak as a security professional, I saw over 20,000 breaches per year. More than half were the result of phishing attempts \u00e2\u0080\u0093 someone clicking a bad link in an email or other digital communication.</p>\n<p>Always maintain a healthy skepticism towards emails and other digital messages. If a message is requesting you take an action or click a link, validate and verify who the message is from. You can think of this as 2FA for digital communications \u00e2\u0080\u0093 don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t just rely on who the email says it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s from. For instance, if your sister is asking you to send $200, text or call her to make sure she really is the one sending the request. Even for seemingly harmless emails, such as someone sharing a link to photos from a recent event, check that they actually sent them.</p>\n<p>According to the <a href=\"https://enterprise.verizon.com/resources/reports/2019-data-breach-investigations-report.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">2019 Verizon Data Breach Investigation Report</a>, we are more likely to click a phishing link when we are on our phones. Be extra careful when checking messages on your phone.</p>\n<p><strong>HABIT: Be skeptical of digital communications. Especially with requests to send money or share secure information, verify who is on the other end.</strong></p>\n<h3>6) Trust but verify what you install.</h3>\n<p>You should also take a trust, but verify approach to applications or software you install on your devices. In short, know what you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re installing. A number of hacks have happened because people installed untrusted, often pirated, software. Pirating software isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t only illegal, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also a great way to infect your computer with a virus or malware.</p>\n<p>When installing software, never install any that uses a licensing hack or cheat code. Software can be expensive, and it may seem like a good deal to download hacks or cheats for commercial software, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also a great way for attackers to gain access to your systems.</p>\n<p>Additionally, download software from official sites and avoid unofficial sites or sites that bundle or package adware with their installers. Adware is often as bad as malware when it comes to security risks.</p>\n<p><strong>HABIT: Only download software from official sites.</strong></p>\n<h3>7) Trust but verify what you plug into your computer.</h3>\n<p>Avoid flash drives and other things you plug into or pair with your computer. Operation \u00e2\u0080\u009c<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008_cyberattack_on_United_States\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Buckshot Yankee</a>\u00e2\u0080\u009d was one of the worst computer breaches in the history of the U.S. Military, and it started with a USB drive intentionally left in a military base parking lot that someone picked up and put into their computer. It may sound like common sense, but don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t insert strange and unknown objects into your computer.</p>\n<p><strong>HABIT: Only plug in or pair devices with your computer if you know exactly where they came from.</strong></p>\n<h2>Beyond the Basics: Good Hygiene &amp; Industrial Strength Tools</h2>\n<p>These next tips are best practices and products that go beyond the basics, with a focus on the recent wave of industrial grade security products have become affordable and available to the public.</p>\n<h3>8) Buy products with security built in.</h3>\n<p>In an ideal world, security is a product feature not a standalone product. And in the last 10 years, more products are taking this approach and building security into products. When possible, opt for hardware that has security built in as a core product feature.</p>\n<p>Chromebook is a great example of a product that has done this by building security in from the very beginning. Chromebooks autoupdate to ensure software stays patched and as secure as possible. They also have a secure boot, which prevents malicious software from loading on your computer while the operating system is booting up, and native mobile device management capabilities to improve security across devices.</p>\n<p>Of course, once you have the hardware, you need to make sure you are taking advantage of the features. Use device pins, passwords and other security measures, and turn on the firewall and automatic updates (see tip #3 \u00e2\u0080\u0093 patch your sh*t!).</p>\n<p><strong>NEXT STEP: Select hardware that has built in security.\u00c2\u00a0</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.google.com/chromebook/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Google Chromebook</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://meraki.cisco.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Cisco Meraki routers and network equipment</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>9) Practice good browser hygiene.</h3>\n<p>Since web browsers are so widely used, they are also widely targeted. Good browser hygiene limits the data available to an attacker if they are able to exploit your browser.</p>\n<p>While most modern browsers now allow you to save credentials or personal information in them, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a bad security practice. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s better to save this information in a separate program like a password manager (see tip #2).</p>\n<p>Tools, like Javascript and Flash, are incredibly feature rich and help dynamic content play on webpages. However, they were also developed before we had secure coding standards and frameworks. As such, they continue to be unsafe and commonly exploited. While disabling these will mean some content won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t load on webpages, your browser will be faster and more secure. Also, disabling Flash autoplay also save your ears from loud and obnoxious content that plays automatically when you visit a website.</p>\n<p><strong>NEXT STEPS:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Clear cache/cookies/history regularly.</strong> (Here\u2019s <a href=\"https://kb.iu.edu/d/ahic\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">a handy resource</a> for cleaning up your browser.)</li>\n<li><strong>Turn off autocomplete.</strong></li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.wikihow.com/Disable-JavaScript\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Turn off Javascript</a> in your browser.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Enable \u201cclick to play\u201d for Flash in your browser.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Follow the <a href=\"https://www.us-cert.gov/publications/securing-your-web-browser\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">US Cert guidelines</a> for Browser Security</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>10) Change passwords and close unused accounts.</h3>\n<p>In addition to setting good passwords, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s important to practice good account hygiene. Passwords should be changed at least yearly, more if you think you can support it. However, even more important than regularly changing passwords is choosing strong, complex passwords (see tip # 2).</p>\n<p>Additionally, there are a number of websites out there that can let you know if any of your accounts were compromised in a security breach. Some password managers also perform this check. If any of your accounts have been compromised, reset your password immediately. If you hear of hacks or security breaches for services you use, check if any of your information was part of the breach. Finally, if you are no longer actively using an account, close it.</p>\n<p><strong>NEXT STEPS:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Change passwords on any accounts where you have been using the same password for longer than a year.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Run a check using haveibeenpwned.com or some other service to find out if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been compromised.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>If you have, change passwords for those accounts.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Close any inactive accounts.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>11) Go Cloud!</h3>\n<p>Another pillar of good security is backing up your data so it can be restored in the case of a breach or data loss. The cloud is more secure than backing software up locally (e.g. using an external hard drive or local server) for a few reasons. First, your data no longer sits only on your computer. If your computer or hardware is stolen or physically damaged, you are able to recover it. Secondly, cloud services usually automatically patch their software, so it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s one less thing for you to think about.</p>\n<p><strong>NEXT STEP: Automate data backups with cloud services, such as Dropbox, Box, or Google Drive.</strong></p>\n<h3>12) Set up detection traps.</h3>\n<p>Security is fundamentally a game of cat-and-mouse. We develop more secure systems, and hackers find ways to break into them. Breaches will happen. And rapid detection is just as important as prevention. Setting traps, the equivalent of digital tripwires, can help you know when you have been hacked.</p>\n<p><strong>NEXT STEP: Set up digital tripwires.</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Use canaries.</strong> It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a classic heist movie twist for someone to be duped, steal a briefcase supposedly full of money, and then discover it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s full of worthless paper. Canaries \u00e2\u0080\u0093 small hardware devices (e.g. tokens) that mimic a device a hacker would want to break into \u00e2\u0080\u0093 are the digital equivalent. They are designed to detect malicious or abnormal behavior and alert you. <a href=\"https://canary.tools/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Thinkst Canary</a> is one of our favorites because it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s affordable for the average consumer and quick to set up.</li>\n<li><strong>Set up email aliases when for online accounts.</strong> Gmail, for example, allows me to <a href=\"https://support.google.com/mail/answer/22370?hl=en\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">create aliases</a> linked to my main account. If ever an email shows up in a breach database, this makes it easy to know exactly where my information was compromised. For example, if I open up a bank account online, I can create the alias <a class=\"__cf_email__\" data-cfemail=\"ee84818b82c58c8f8085808f838bae89838f8782c08d8183c0\" href=\"/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection\">[email\u00a0protected]</a> If I ever show up in a breach database, or start receiving unwanted email at that address, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll know which account was responsible.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>13) Encrypt.</h3>\n<p>Encryption is using very large numbers and fun math tricks to make data unreadable unless you have a key to crack the code. (Fun fact: the use of ciphers, one encryption method, dates back to the Ancient Egyptians circa 1900 BC.)</p>\n<p>When it comes to software, encryption is often the last line of defense for protecting data when dealing with a determined attacker. It represents a final code that has to be cracked before they can see sensitive information. As a best practice, you should encrypt your operating system and backups and use SSL or TLS3 (two security standards for transmitting information over the internet).</p>\n<p><strong>NEXT STEPS: </strong>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Encrypt all hardware drives/storage.</strong> For your hardware, operating systems typically offer built-in protection \u00e2\u0080\u0093 use <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/information-protection/bitlocker/bitlocker-overview\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">BitLocker</a> to encrypt Microsoft\u00e2\u0080\u0099s operating system, and <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204837\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">FileVault</a> for Apple. ChromeOS is encrypted by default, no action needed.</li>\n<li><strong>SSL everything.</strong> If you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t see the SSL turned on for a webpage, do not put your data into that page. To check for SSL make sure you see a closed lock icon in your web browser. Even better, use a browser plug-in, such as <a href=\"https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">SSL from the Electronic Frontier Foundation</a>, that turns on SSL for everything. Encrypt backups. Make sure you never leave your back-up data laying around unencrypted.</li>\n<li><strong>Encrypt your backup data.</strong> <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/keep-your-time-machine-backup-disk-secure-mh21241/mac\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">OSX</a>, <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT205220\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">IOS</a>, <a href=\"https://security.googleblog.com/2018/10/google-and-android-have-your-back-by.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Android</a>, and Windows can be encrypted by using a password to protect the backup.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>14) Use a VPN, not public networks or computers.</h3>\n<p>Nothing in this world is free, including WiFi. In general, avoid unknown wifi networks, especially open public networks, because attackers may have control of the network and launch a person-in-the-middle attack, where they intercept and change traffic going to and from computers on the network.</p>\n<p>And never use a public computer as even those in internet cafes and business centers almost always have something bad running on them. If you have to use a public computer, immediately change all passwords from a trusted machine. Think of it as the digital equivalent of washing your hands after riding the subway.</p>\n<p><strong>NEXT STEPS: Set up a VPN or mobile hotspot for connecting to private, secure internet when in public.</strong></p>\n<h2>For the extra paranoid</h2>\n<p>These final two steps are for those who want their cybersecurity to be Fort Knox level.</p>\n<h3>15. Read the fine print.</h3>\n<p>It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a pain to read end user agreements, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s especially important when installing applications that access your data. Make sure you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re comfortable with the level of access the app is asking for. Should you give a random photo app access to all your photos? Does a Dog Walker app need to have access to all your email? Sensible questions about data access go a long way.</p>\n<h3>16. Keep master passwords and hardware keys in a safe.</h3>\n<p>Stuff happens and passwords/keys are often lost or forgotten. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s great to have an extra set of keys saved somewhere in case you ever need them. And even in a digital world, physical safes improve security. Keep your master passwords and back up hardware keys in a high quality fireproof safe. If you do not have a place to install a safe, a safe deposit box at a local bank branch also works.</p>\n<p>And now that you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve completed the security audit, bookmark this link and set a reminder for your next digital security check up.

It shouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be, but it is. The tools, often analog travel agencies integrating with SaaS systems which were originally on-premise systems, are notoriously frustrating to use. The experience for the company is that few follow the travel policy. The experience for the employee is that they deal with a horrible user experience.</p>\n<p>Employees endure a litany of error messages, out of policy notifications, and a constant need for approval to go around rigid and unintelligent travel policies. This wastes time, contributes to a culture of micro-management and lack of trust, and leads to employee frustration. Ultimately, travelers just abandon the travel booking tool and expense what they book on their own. For example, say you need to be in the Bay Area for an important customer meeting during Dreamforce. The company policy is $350 per night, but good luck finding a hotel under that price at that time. So you get error notices in Concur, you attempt to book a room which is then declined, and then you need to get your VP to approve the out of policy spend just so you can make it to the important meeting. Who came up with this system?!</p>\n<p>Sadly, the data supports the anecdote:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>83% of business travelers spend more than 1 hour booking each work trip, a costly loss of productive work time</li>\n<li>50% of corporate travelers today ignore their company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s travel solutions, thereby limiting a company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ability to track and manage travel spend and to account for traveling employees in the event of an emergency</li>\n<li>64% of corporate travelers feel like they have to fend for themselves on the road, with only 8% reporting that their travel management company proactively reaches out when something goes wrong</li>\n</ul>\n<p>But it shouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be this way. The Internet exists. We can do better.</p>\n<p>Two of my smartest old colleagues from my time at HP thought so. Ilan Twig and Ariel Cohen spent over a decade each living in these broken systems and they thought \u00e2\u0080\u009cthere must be a better way.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Their company, <a href=\"https://tripactions.com/\">TripActions</a>, applies modern software, machine learning, 24/7 traveler support, and smart incentives to the old problem. The result is a completely personalized, easy-to-use experience that treats employees like VIP customers. TripActions uses traveler feedback to deliver the very best flights and hotels in the way the employee wants them, with all their favorite preferences and amenities, and conveniently and seamlessly provides the employee with meaningful rewards for complying with the corporate policy. Rather than trying to force a brittle, static travel policy onto a dynamic situation, TripActions offers flexible incentives that optimize spend, convenience, and user experience.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>For every search that is done on TripActions, it calculates a \u00e2\u0080\u009cPrice to Beat\u00e2\u0080\u009d. The Price to Beat considers real-time inventory availability and pricing, user preferences such as loyalty club memberships, and company preferences including corporate program memberships and company policies. The Price to Beat is dynamic and specific to every individual search that is done.</li>\n<li>If a traveler books an option that is below the Price to Beat, she earns a share of the savings, on average 30% of every dollar saved.</li>\n<li>Travelers accrue their savings as TripActions Rewards, which can be redeemed for Amazon gift cards, upgrades on future business trips or personal vacations booked on TripActions.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In this way, TripActions modernizes the corporate travel experience while rewarding both the company and the employee.</p>\n<p>And it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s totally convenient. Your expense report automagically gets filled out, your frequent flyer, TSA, and Global Entry information are entered for you, and the TripActions support team proactively intervenes when they notice your flight is delayed. How much better does it work than the old-style systems that take an hour to book one trip? The average time to book a trip on TripActions is 6 minutes.</p>\n<p>This all sounded too good to be true, but when we called their marquee customers like Sara Lee Frozen Bakery, Lyft, and Dropbox, we were impressed to see that customer satisfaction was off-the-charts for the employees, the finance team, and the corporate travel department \u2014 something never before seen in this market.</p>\n<p>For these reasons, I am thrilled to announce that Andreessen Horowitz is investing in TripActions and I am joining the board.</p>\n", "author": "Ben Horowitz"}, "197": {"podcast": "The Right Kind of Ambition | Andreessen Horowitz", "url": "https://a16z.com/2010/08/30/the-right-kind-of-ambition/", "contents": "Want more a16z?

Surprisingly to me, I received a large number of responses from readers questioning whether or not this was good advice. Here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s how one commenter phrased it:</p>\n<blockquote><p>I agree with much of this post but I disagree with the following:</p>\n<p>\u00e2\u0080\u009cAs defined by Andy Grove, the right kind of ambition is ambition for the company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s success with the executive\u00e2\u0080\u0099s own success only coming as a by-product of the company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s victory.\u00e2\u0080\u009d</p>\n<p>That may have worked in the past but I believe today, the company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s success and the executive\u00e2\u0080\u0099s success should go hand in hand, not one coming as a by-product of the other, particularly as described above.</p>\n<p>Curious why should an employee be motivated first by a company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s success? Would this work in all departments\u00e2\u0080\u0094i.e. sales?</p></blockquote>\n<p>In addition to comments like the one above, my business partner Marc Andreessen suggested that I write a post on how to screen for the right kind of ambition. In response, this post aims to clarify why you should care about senior managers having the right kind of ambition and give some tips on how to screen for them in an interview.</p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: normal\">Why should senior managers have the right kind of ambition?</span></h2>\n<p>At a macro level, a company will be most successful if the senior managers optimize for the company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s success (think of this as a global optimization) as opposed to their own personal success (local optimization). No matter how well the CEO designs the personal incentive programs, they will never be perfect. In addition, career incentives like promotions and territory ownership fall outside the scope of bonus plans and other a priori management tools. In an equity-based compensation structure, optimizing for the company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s success should yield better results for individuals as well. As my Opsware head of sales Mark Cranney used to say, \u00e2\u0080\u009c2% of 0 is 0.\u00e2\u0080\u009d</p>\n<p>It is particularly important that managers have the right kind of ambition, because anything else will be exceptionally de-motivating for their employees. As an employee, why would I want to work long hours to advance the career of my manager? If the manager cares about his career more than the company, then that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d be doing. Nothing motivates a great employee more than a mission that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s so important that it supersedes everyone\u00e2\u0080\u0099s personal ambition. As a result, managers with the <em>right kind of ambition</em> tend to be radically more valuable than those with the wrong kind. For a complete explanation of the dangers of managers with the <em>wrong kind of ambition</em>, I strongly recommend Dr. Suess\u00e2\u0080\u0099s management masterpiece <em>Yertle the Turtle</em>.</p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: normal\">Screening for the right kind of ambition</span></h2>\n<p>As with any complex character trait, there is no way to perfectly screen for the right kind of ambition in an interview, but hopefully some of these thoughts will prove useful.</p>\n<p>At a macro-level, everybody views the world through her own personal prism. When interviewing candidates, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s helpful to watch for small distinctions that indicate whether they view the world through the \u00e2\u0080\u009cme\u00e2\u0080\u009d prism or the \u00e2\u0080\u009cteam\u00e2\u0080\u009d prism.</p>\n<p>People who view the world through the <em>me</em> prism might describe a prior company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s failure in an interview as follows: \u00e2\u0080\u009cMy last job was my e-commerce play.\u00c2\u00a0 I felt that it was important to round out my resume.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Note the use of \u00e2\u0080\u009cmy\u00e2\u0080\u009d to personalize the company in a way that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s unlikely that anyone else at the company would agree with. In fact, the other employees in the company might even be offended by this usage. People with the right kind of ambition would not likely use the word \u00e2\u0080\u009cplay\u00e2\u0080\u009d to describe their effort to work as a team to build something substantial. Finally, people who use the \u00e2\u0080\u009cme\u00e2\u0080\u009d prism find it natural and obvious to speak in terms of \u00e2\u0080\u009cbuilding out my resume\u00e2\u0080\u009d while people who use the \u00e2\u0080\u009cteam\u00e2\u0080\u009d prism find such phrases to be somewhat uncomfortable and awkward, because they clearly indicate an individual goal which is separate from the team goal.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, people who view the world purely through the <em>team</em> prism will very seldom use the words \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u009d or \u00e2\u0080\u009cme\u00e2\u0080\u009d even when answering questions about their accomplishments. Even in an interview, they will deflect credit to others on their previous team. They will tend to be far more interested in how your company will win than how they will be compensated or what their career path will be. When asked about a previously failed company, they will generally feel such great responsibility that they will describe in detail their own misjudgments and bad decisions.</p>\n<p>When we hired the head of worldwide sales for Opsware, using this screen proved to be quite valuable. We interviewed over 20 candidates for the position before hiring the aforementioned Mark Cranney. Since this was a sales position, I should mention (in reference to the commenter above) that ambition for the company above ones own goals is particularly important for the head of sales. The reasons are many:</p>\n<p><em>The local incentives in sales are particularly strong and difficult to balance without the right kind of leadership.</em></p>\n<p>The sales organization is the face of the company to the outside world. If that group optimizes for itself, your company will have a major problem.</p>\n<p>In hi-tech companies, fraud generally starts in sales due to managers attempting to perfect the ultimate local optimization</p>\n<p>Throughout our interview process, candidates would take sole credit for landing extremely large deals, achieving impressive goals, and generating company success. Invariably, the candidates who claimed the most credit for deals would have the most difficult time describing the details of how the deal was actually won and orchestrated. During reference checks, others involved in the deals would tell a much different story.</p>\n<p>When I spoke to Mark, on the other hand, it was difficult to get him to discuss his personal accomplishments. In fact, some of the other interviewers felt that Mark was standoffish and even obnoxious in the way he bristled at certain questions. One interviewer complained: \u00e2\u0080\u009cBen, I know that he increased the size of the Nike deal from $1M to $5M, because our contact at Nike told me that, but Mark wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t go into any detail on it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d When I interviewed Mark, he really only wanted to discuss how his old company PTC won. He went into great detail about how his team diagnosed weaknesses vs. the competition and how he worked with the CTO Hugh Hempleman to advance the product. He then talked about how he worked with the CEO Dick Harrison to revise the way the sales force was trained and organized.</p>\n<p>When the conversation turned to Opsware, Mark had already interviewed sales reps at our number 1 competitor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s company and knew what deals they were in. He relentlessly questioned me on how we were going to win the deals that they were in and how we planned to get into the deals that we weren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t in. He wanted to know the strengths and weaknesses of everyone else on the team. He wanted to know the game plan for winning. The topics of his potential compensation and career advancement didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t come up until the very end of the process. And then he only wanted assurances that compensation was performance and not politically based. It was clear that Mark was all about the team.</p>\n<p>During Mark\u00e2\u0080\u0099s tenure, sales increased more than tenfold and our market capitalization increased twentyfold. More to the point, voluntary attrition in the sales organization was extremely low, customers were managed fairly and honestly, and our legal and finance teams often commented that first and foremost, Mark protected the company.</p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: normal\">Final Thought</span></h2>\n<p>While it may work to have individual employees who optimize for their own careers, counting on senior managers to do all the right things for all the wrong reasons is a dangerous idea.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The views expressed here are those of the individual AH Capital Management, L.L.C.

Entrepreneurs liked that we stuck our necks out right alongside them, when the outcome was the most uncertain and their reputational risk the highest! It was an easy call for us: they were doing all the hard work. And let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s be real, we didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have a long list of successful exits to rest on.

It was a lot of experimenting and trying out different things. Then Sonal joined and made it into the powerhouse that it is today. The response was just as powerful and positive as with our posts. In fact, it expanded the audience globally and far beyond the tech community. Just one example is a United States senator contacted us saying he was going to draft legislation based on a podcast he heard and wanted to meet the entrepreneur who promoted the idea.

Living through a pandemic has not been fun at all, but try doing it without technology.\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This means we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re hiring!\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m thrilled to announce that we have made one very important new hire already, and that is the executive editor: Maggie Leung. Hiring for this particular position was a super tall order. The list of must-haves is long: a proven builder, a critical thinker, a person who can hire and inspire a team, oh, and someone with strong journalistic chops. Maggie checks all these and then some! She joins us from NerdWallet, where she built an entire content operation of 90+ pros, from scratch. Before that, Maggie spent more than 20 years in daily news, including stints at the Washington Post, the Wall Street Journal, and as a senior editor at CNN. Simply put, when you find someone like Maggie, you have to work with them.\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And of course Maggie is joining our outstanding editorial team, led by our wonderful managing editor Amelia Salyers, who hired many of the editors, and of course, the super-talented and incomparable Sonal Chokshi, who continues to guide our voice and editorial vision as our editor in chief. Every piece of content you see or hear has been shaped and edited by the editorial team.\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be launching our expanded effort into </span><a href=\"https://a16z.com/opeds-contributed-pieces-pitch-guidelines/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">contributed pieces</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> later this year, with more announcements to come before then, so sign up below to get notified.

You don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even need to enter your </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">current</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> location\u00e2\u0080\u0094Google Maps already knows where you are. What if that same predictive software existed for our finances? Imagine a future where you could outline your goals as a student\u00e2\u0080\u0094say, graduate, move to your dream city, save for a house, plan for kids\u00e2\u0080\u0094and an app would execute your optimal financial plan, rerouting and adjusting for \u00e2\u0080\u009ctraffic\u00e2\u0080\u009d along the way.\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">For many consumers, the financial services industry is intimidatingly complex. Sure, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099d all be better off if we understood</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> its intricacies, but most of us are already preoccupied by the practicalities: </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Can we refinance our credit card debt, student loans, or mortgages, and which should we prioritize? Could we save more? How should we think about investing?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Many well-intentioned startups and incumbents have ramped up their educational efforts to help answer those questions in recent years. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">But while having a strong basic understanding is important, I believe that the best way to cut through financial confusion and needless complexity is with software</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. Software is very, very good at distilling the key points we need to make decisions\u00e2\u0080\u0094and, in some cases, even making those decisions for us. Welcome to the era of autonomous finance.\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<h2><b>The evolution of \u00e2\u0080\u009cauto-finance\u00e2\u0080\u009d</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The earliest examples of \u00e2\u0080\u009cautonomous-finance\u00e2\u0080\u009d were robo-advisors like Wealthfront and Betterment, which provided an alternative to high-cost mutual funds. For the self directed manager, this service took the thinking out of which stocks to pick and how to rebalance; it even executed more complicated strategies, like tax loss harvesting. This auto-investing technology was so attractive to consumers (low fees!) that many larger asset managers, including Blackrock and Schwab, either bought one of the robo-advising startups or launched their own.\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Next came automatic-saving applications, which squirrel away extra cash into a separate account, either by rounding up from purchases\u00e2\u0080\u0094putting away 50 cents after you buy a $2.50 coffee, for example\u00e2\u0080\u0094or by targeting a predetermined amount. These apps can be helpful in forcing a behavior that most of us don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think about on a day-to-day basis.\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Today, autonomous-finance companies are tackling one of the most pernicious financial black holes: credit card debt. Tally, for instance, takes over your credit card payments entirely by linking </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">your bank account and your credit cards. The app consolidates all your credit debt into a single monthly payment at a lower overall rate. That monthly payment not only covers your minimum balances, but also knocks down your principal so you can become debt-free faster.</span></p>\n<h2><b>The future: Fully autonomous finance</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Despite strides over the past decade, many more financial services verticals remain primed for software solutions.\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">One obvious category is student debt. Though there are dozens of programs for student debt relief across the country, just figuring out what they are, who qualifies, and how to apply can be bewildering. A software application could algorithmically evaluate all the government-sponsored programs and automatically alert borrowers when they qualify. To take this one step further, the software could even apply for them.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><br/>\n</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Another opportunity for auto-finance is the sometimes seedy world of </span><a href=\"https://a16z.com/2019/09/25/fintech-newsletter-september-2019/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">debt settlement</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u00c2\u00a0</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Intermediaries exist, in part, because </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">creditors can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t advertise settlement plans. (Imagine this automated phone prompt: \u00e2\u0080\u009cPress 1 to pay your bill. Press 2 to only pay half of your bill.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Even those able to pay fully would choose option 2.) B</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">ecause debt settlement is difficult to regulate, it is full of bad actors. The process can be terrifying for consumers, often involving multiple collection agencies calling several times a day. Alternatively, software could evaluate which customers banks should consider settling with. Software would also show consumers their full range of options and the real downstream credit score effects. By being transparent and data-driven, such services could build trust in a highly stressful financial moment.\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Auto-finance could also help optimize your revenue. Let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s say you are living in a metropolitan area, working 40 to 50 hours per week across a couple jobs. You\u00e2\u0080\u0099d like to earn more money, so you decide to pick up a couple extra shifts. How can you ensure you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re making the most amount of money for each marginal hour? Are your current 40 to 50 hours maximizing your time? Should you get another part time job at the local retail store or work for one of the gig economy platforms? Imagine a service that knows what you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re currently making, as well as the going rate of all the jobs available to you. Such an app could automatically match you with your best option\u00e2\u0080\u0094maybe even apply for you.\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">These are just a few consumer financial pain points that could be abstracted away with software, but the possibilities are many. Auto-finance could sign you up for insurance or transfer you to the most advantageous policy. If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re an independent contractor, it could regulate your finances, including </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">tax withholding, benefits, and savings. It could assist small businesses in optimizing cash flow.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">There are still hurdles in the movement toward a fully automated financial future. Consumers need to trust that a software program will do the right thing. To combat distrust, many autonomous-finance companies currently prompt the customer to approve the recommended action before it\u2019s executed by the software. And though aggregation services extract data like bank and credit card transactions, these data sets are rarely 100 percent reliable; they require work on the part of the company to ensure accuracy. It can also be difficult to assess the right course of action when looking at only a sliver of your finances, rather than the complete picture. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">You can now automate pieces of your financial life by cobbling together a series of applications: One for credit card debt, one for student debt, and so on. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">We are in the early phases. The arrival of true autonomous finance will be the companies that provide the connective tissue between these sometimes competing needs, automatically monitoring and adjusting your financial roadmap over the course of your lifetime.\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n", "author": "Angela Strange"}, "201": {"podcast": "Taming the Tail: Adventures in Improving AI Economics | Andreessen...", "url": "https://a16z.com/2020/08/12/taming-the-tail-adventures-in-improving-ai-economics/", "contents": "Articles.

AI companies often have lower gross margins, can be harder to scale, and don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t always have strong defensive moats. From our experience, many of these challenges seem to be endemic to the problem space, and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve yet to uncover a simple playbook that guarantees traditional software economics in all cases.</p>\n<p>That said, many experienced AI company builders have made tremendous progress in improving the financial profiles of their companies relative to a naive approach. They do this with a range of methods spanning data engineering, model development, cloud operations, organizational design, product management, and many other areas. The common thread that often guides them is a deep, practical understanding of the problem to be solved.</p>\n<p>So while our previous post outlined the challenges facing AI businesses, the goal of this post is to provide some guidance on how to tackle them. We share some of the lessons, best practices, and earned secrets we learned through formal and informal conversations with dozens of leading machine learning teams. For the most part, these are their words \u00e2\u0080\u0093 not ours.

The job of an AI developer is to fit a statistical model to a dataset, test how well the model performs on new data, and repeat. This is essentially an attempt to reign in the complexity of the real world.</p>\n<p>Software development, on the other hand, is a process of building and engineering. Once the spec and overall architecture for an application have been defined, new features and functionality can be added incrementally \u00e2\u0080\u0093 one line of code, library, or API call at a time \u00e2\u0080\u0093 until the full vision takes shape. This process is largely under the control of the developer, and the complexity of the resulting system can often be reigned in using standard computer science practices, such as modularization, instrumentation, virtualization, or choosing the right abstractions.</p>\n<p>Unlike software engineering, very little is in the developer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s control with AI applications \u00e2\u0080\u0093 the complexity of the system is inherent to the training data itself. And for many natural systems, the data is often messy, heavy-tailed, unpredictable, and highly entropic. Even worse, code written by the developer does not directly change program behavior \u00e2\u0080\u0093 one experienced founder used the analogy that \u00e2\u0080\u009cML is essentially code that creates code (as a function of the input data)\u2026 this creates an additional layer of indirection that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hard to reason about.\u00e2\u0080\u009d**</p>\n<span class=\"bctt-click-to-tweet\"><span class=\"bctt-ctt-text\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https://a16z.com/2020/08/12/taming-the-tail-adventures-in-improving-ai-economics/&amp;text=The%20job%20of%20an%20AI%20developer%20is%20to%20fit%20a%20statistical%20model%20to%20a%20dataset%2C%20test%20how%20well%20the%20model%20performs%20on%20new%20data%2C%20and%20repeat.%20This%20is%20essentially%20an%20attempt%20to%20reign%20in%20the%20complexity%20of%20the%20real%20world.&amp;via=a16z&amp;related=a16z\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">The job of an AI developer is to fit a statistical model to a dataset, test how well the model performs on new data, and repeat.

Popular keywords in the \u00e2\u0080\u009chead\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009cmiddle\u00e2\u0080\u009d of the distribution (shown in blue below) account for less than 30% of all terms.

These costs are often far higher for ML than for traditional software, since so much data, so many experiments, and so many parameters are required to achieve accurate results. Anecdotally, development costs \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and failure rates \u00e2\u0080\u0093 for AI applications can be 3-5x higher than in typical software products.</p>\n<p>However, a narrow focus on cloud costs misses two more pernicious potential impacts of the long tail. First, the long tail can contribute to high variable costs beyond infrastructure. If, for example, the questions sent to a chatbot vary greatly from customer to customer \u00e2\u0080\u0093 i.e. a large fraction of the queries are in the tail \u00e2\u0080\u0093 then building an accurate system will likely require substantial work <em>per customer</em>. Unfortunately, depending on the distribution of the solution space, this work and the associated COGS (cost of goods sold) may be hard to engineer away.</p>\n<p>Even worse, AI businesses working on long-tailed problems can actually show <a href=\"https://a16z.com/2019/05/09/data-network-effects-moats/\"><em>diseconomies</em> of scale</a> \u00e2\u0080\u0093 meaning the economics get worse over time relative to competitors. Data has a cost to collect, process, and maintain. While this cost tends to decrease over time relative to data volume, the marginal benefit of additional data points declines much faster. In fact, this relationship appears to be exponential \u00e2\u0080\u0093 at some point, developers may need 10x more data to achieve a 2x subjective improvement. While it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s tempting to wish for an AI analog to Moore\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Law that will dramatically improve processing performance and drive down costs, that <a href=\"https://openai.com/blog/ai-and-compute/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t</a> seem to be taking place (<a href=\"https://openai.com/blog/ai-and-efficiency/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">algorithmic improvements</a> notwithstanding).</p>\n<p>In what follows, we present guidance collected from many practitioners on how to think through and tackle these issues.</p>\n<h2>Part II: Building better AI systems</h2>\n<h3>Toward a solution</h3>\n<p>So \u00e2\u0080\u0093 many AI systems are designed to predict the interactions in complex underlying systems, resulting in long-tailed distributions of input data. Developers usually can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t fully characterize the data, so they model it through a series of (supervised) learning experiments. This process requires a huge amount of work, can hit an asymptote in terms of performance, and causes or exacerbates many of the economic challenges facing AI companies.</p>\n<p>This is the crux of the AI business dilemma. If the economics are a function of the problem \u00e2\u0080\u0093 not the technology per se \u00e2\u0080\u0093 how can we improve them?</p>\n<p>There is no easy answer. The long tail is, in some ways, a measure of the complexity of the problem being solved \u00e2\u0080\u0093 i.e. it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the reason we need automation in the first place \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and is directly correlated to the effort needed to tackle it. There are, however, ways to treat the long tail as a first-order concern and build for it.</p>\n<p>We heard a ton of great advice from ML engineers and researchers on this topic. We share some of the best and most innovative guidance below.</p>\n<span class=\"bctt-click-to-tweet\"><span class=\"bctt-ctt-text\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https://a16z.com/2020/08/12/taming-the-tail-adventures-in-improving-ai-economics/&amp;text=The%20long%20tail%20is%2C%20in%20some%20ways%2C%20a%20measure%20of%20the%20complexity%20of%20the%20problem%20being%20solved%20and%20is%20directly%20correlated%20to%20the%20effort%20needed%20to%20tackle%20it.%20There%20are%2C%20however%2C%20ways%20to%20treat%20it%20as%20a%20first-order%20concern%20and%20build%20for%20it.&amp;via=a16z&amp;related=a16z\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">The long tail is, in some ways, a measure of the complexity of the problem being solved and is directly correlated to the effort needed to tackle it.

If not \u00e2\u0080\u0093 for example, if the problem can be described reasonably well with linear or polynomial constraints \u00e2\u0080\u0093 the message was clear: don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t use machine learning! And <em>especially</em> don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t use deep learning.</p>\n<p>This may seem like odd advice from a group of AI experts. But it reflects the reality that the costs we documented <a href=\"https://a16z.com/2020/02/16/the-new-business-of-ai-and-how-its-different-from-traditional-software/\">in our last post</a> can be substantial \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and the causes behind them, covered in the first part of this post, difficult to work around. These problems also tend to get worse as model complexity grows, since sophisticated models are expensive to train and maintain. They can even perform worse than simpler techniques when used inappropriately, tending to overparameterize small datasets and/or produce fragile models that degrade rapidly in production.</p>\n<p>When you do use ML, an engineer from Shopify pointed out, logistic regression and random forests are popular for a reason \u00e2\u0080\u0093 they are interpretable, scalable, and cost-effective. Bigger and more sophisticated models do perform better in many cases (e.g. for language understanding/generation, or to capture fast-moving social media trends). But it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s important to determine when accuracy improvements justify significant increases in training and maintenance costs.</p>\n<p>As another ML leader put it, \u00e2\u0080\u009cML is not a religion, but science, engineering, and a little art. The vocabulary of ML approaches is quite large, and while we scientists tend to see every problem to be the nail that fits the hammer we just finished building, the problem might just be a screw sometimes if we look precisely.\u00e2\u0080\u009d***</p>\n<h3>Harder: <em>Global</em> long tail problems</h3>\n<p>If you are working on a long-tail problem \u00e2\u0080\u0093 which includes most common NLP (natural language processing), computer vision, and other ML tasks \u00e2\u0080\u0093 it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s critical to determine the degree of consistency across customers, regions, segments, and other user cohorts. If the overlap is high, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s likely you can serve most of your users with a global model (or ensemble). This can have a huge, positive impact on gross margins and engineering efficiency.</p>\n<p>We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen this pattern most often in B2C tech companies that have access to large user datasets. The same advantages often hold for B2B vendors working on unconstrained tasks in relatively low entropy environments like autonomous vehicles, fraud detection, or data entry \u00e2\u0080\u0093 where the deployment setting has a fairly weak influence on user behavior.</p>\n<p>In these situations, some local training (e.g. for major customers) is often still necessary. But you can minimize it by framing the problem in a global context and building proactively around the long tail. The standard advice to do this includes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Optimize the model</strong> by adding more training data (including customer data), adjusting hyperparameters, or tweaking model architecture \u00e2\u0080\u0093 which tends to be useful only until you hit the long tail</li>\n<li><strong>Narrow the problem</strong> by explicitly restricting what a user can enter into the system \u00e2\u0080\u0093 which is most useful when the problem has a \u00e2\u0080\u009cfat head\u00e2\u0080\u009d (e.g. data vendors that focus on high-value contacts) or is susceptible to user error (e.g. Linkedin supposedly had 17,000 entities related to IBM until they implemented auto-complete)</li>\n<li><strong>Convert the problem</strong> into a single-turn interface (e.g. content feeds, product suggestions, \u00e2\u0080\u009cpeople you may know,\u00e2\u0080\u009d etc) or prompt for user input / design human failover to cover exceptional cases (e.g. teleoperations for autonomous vehicles)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-11-at-5.15.52-PM.png?ssl=1\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-301038\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"1046\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-11-at-5.15.52-PM.png?resize=1584%2C1046&amp;ssl=1\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-11-at-5.15.52-PM.png?w=1584&amp;ssl=1 1584w, https://i2.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-11-at-5.15.52-PM.png?resize=300%2C198&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-11-at-5.15.52-PM.png?resize=1024%2C676&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-11-at-5.15.52-PM.png?resize=768%2C507&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-11-at-5.15.52-PM.png?resize=1536%2C1014&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i2.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-11-at-5.15.52-PM.png?resize=125%2C83&amp;ssl=1 125w, https://i2.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-11-at-5.15.52-PM.png?resize=500%2C330&amp;ssl=1 500w, https://i2.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-11-at-5.15.52-PM.png?resize=954%2C630&amp;ssl=1 954w\" width=\"1584\"/></a></p>\n<p>For many real-world problems, however, these tactics may not be feasible. For those cases, experienced ML builders shared a more general pattern called <strong>componentizing</strong>.</p>\n<p>An ML engineer at Cloudflare, for example, shared an example related to <a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-bot-management-machine-learning-and-more/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">bot detection</a>. Their goal was to process a massive set of log files to identify (and flag or block) non-human visitors to millions of websites. Treating this as a single task was ineffective at scale because the concept of a \u00e2\u0080\u009cbot\u00e2\u0080\u009d included hundreds of distinct subtypes \u00e2\u0080\u0093 search crawlers, data scrapers, port scanners, etc \u00e2\u0080\u0093 exhibiting unique behaviors. Using clustering techniques and experimenting with various levels of granularity, though, they ultimately found 6-7 categories of bots that could each be addressed with a unique supervised learning model.

Determining overlap is also nontrivial, since input data (especially in the enterprise) may be segregated for commercial or regulatory reasons. Frequently, the difference between a global problem and a local problem lies in the scope of available data.</p>\n<p>Local ML problems still often have long-tailed distributions that must be addressed. But the work can quickly multiply based on the degree of local variation. A large music streaming company, for instance, found they needed unique playlist generation models for each country where they operate. Factory floor analytics vendors, similarly, often end up with a unique model for each customer or assembly line they service. While there is no simple fix for this, several strategies can help bring the benefits of global models to local problem spaces.</p>\n<p>A near-term, practical option is the <strong>meta model</strong> pattern, in which a single model is trained to cover a range of customers or tasks. This technique tends to be discussed most often in a research setting (e.g. multi-task robots). But for AI application companies, it can also drastically reduce the number of models they need to maintain. One successful marketing startup, for instance, was able to combine thousands of offline, customer-specific models into a single meta model \u00e2\u0080\u0093 which was much less expensive in aggregate to retrain.</p>\n<p>Another emerging solution is <strong>transfer learning</strong>. There is widespread enthusiasm among ML teams that pre-trained models \u00e2\u0080\u0093 especially attention-based language models like BERT or <a href=\"https://a16z.com/2020/07/29/16mins-gpt3-natural-language-neural-net-deep-learning-few-shot-zero-shot/\">GPT-3</a> \u00e2\u0080\u0093 can reduce and simplify training needs across the board, ultimately making it much easier to fine-tune models per customer with small amounts of data. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no doubting the potential of these techniques. Relatively few companies, however, are using these models heavily in production today \u00e2\u0080\u0093 partly because their massive size makes them difficult and costly to operate \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and customer-specific work is still required in many applications. The benefits of this promising area do not seem to be broadly realized yet.</p>\n<p>Finally, several practitioners at large tech companies described a variant of transfer learning based on <strong>trunk models</strong>. Facebook, for instance, maintains <a href=\"https://research.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/hpca-2018-facebook.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">thousands</a> of ML models, most of which were trained separately for a specific task. But over time, models that share similar functionality can be joined together with a common \u00e2\u0080\u009ctrunk\u00e2\u0080\u009d to reduce complexity. The goal is to make the trunk models as \u00e2\u0080\u009cthick\u00e2\u0080\u009d as possible (i.e. doing most of the work) while making the task-specific \u00e2\u0080\u009cbranch\u00e2\u0080\u009d models as \u00e2\u0080\u009cthin\u00e2\u0080\u009d as possible \u00e2\u0080\u0093 without sacrificing accuracy. In a <a href=\"https://ai.facebook.com/research/publications/groknet-unified-computer-vision-model-trunk-and-embeddings-for-commerce/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">published example</a>, an AI team working on automated product descriptions combined seven vertical-specific models \u00e2\u0080\u0093 one for furniture, one for fashion, one for cars, etc \u00e2\u0080\u0093 into a single trunked architecture that was 2x as accurate and cheaper to run.</p>\n<p>In the limit, this approach looks a lot like the global model pattern. At the same time, it allows for parallel model development and a high degree of local accuracy. It also gives data scientists richer, embedded data to work with and converts some O(n^2) problems \u00e2\u0080\u0093 like language translation, where you have to translate each of <em>n</em> languages into <em>n</em> other languages \u00e2\u0080\u0093 into O(n) complexity \u00e2\u0080\u0093 where each language can be translated into an intermediate representation instead. This may be an indication of where the future is headed, helping to define the basic building blocks or APIs of the ML development process.</p>\n<span class=\"bctt-click-to-tweet\"><span class=\"bctt-ctt-text\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https://a16z.com/2020/08/12/taming-the-tail-adventures-in-improving-ai-economics/&amp;text=An%20AI%20team%20working%20on%20automated%20product%20descriptions%20combined%20seven%20vertical-specific%20models%20%E2%80%93%20one%20for%20furniture%2C%20one%20for%20fashion%2C%20one%20for%20cars%2C%20etc%20%E2%80%93%20into%20a%20single%20trunked%20architecture%20that%20was%202x%20as%20accurate%20and%20cheaper%20to%20run.&amp;via=a16z&amp;related=a16z\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">An AI team working on automated product descriptions combined seven vertical-specific models \u00e2\u0080\u0093 one for furniture, one for fashion, one for cars, etc \u00e2\u0080\u0093 into a single trunked architecture that was 2x as accurate and cheaper to run. </a></span><a class=\"bctt-ctt-btn\" href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https://a16z.com/2020/08/12/taming-the-tail-adventures-in-improving-ai-economics/&amp;text=An%20AI%20team%20working%20on%20automated%20product%20descriptions%20combined%20seven%20vertical-specific%20models%20%E2%80%93%20one%20for%20furniture%2C%20one%20for%20fashion%2C%20one%20for%20cars%2C%20etc%20%E2%80%93%20into%20a%20single%20trunked%20architecture%20that%20was%202x%20as%20accurate%20and%20cheaper%20to%20run.&amp;via=a16z&amp;related=a16z\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Click To Tweet</a></span>\n<h3>Table stakes: Operations</h3>\n<p>Finally, many experienced ML engineers emphasized the importance of operational best practices to improve AI economics. These are a few of the most compelling examples.</p>\n<p><strong>Consolidate data pipelines.</strong> Model sprawl doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have to mean pipeline sprawl. When global models weren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t feasible, one founder achieved efficiency gains by combining most customers into a single data transformation process with relatively minor impact to system latency. Other groups reduced costs by retraining less often (e.g. via a nightly queue or when enough data accumulates) and performing training runs closer to the data.</p>\n<p><strong>Build an edge case engine.</strong> You can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t address the long tail if you can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t see it. Tesla, for instance, assembled a huge dataset of <a href=\"https://youtu.be/hx7BXih7zx8?t=513\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">weird stop signs</a> to train their Autopilot models. Collecting long-tail data in a repeatable way is a critical capability for most ML teams \u00e2\u0080\u0093 usually involving identifying out-of-distribution data in production (either with statistical tests or by measuring unusual model behavior), sourcing similar examples, labeling the new data, and intelligently retraining, often using active learning.</p>\n<p><strong>Own the infrastructure.</strong> Many leading ML organizations run (and even design) their own ML clusters. In some cases, this can be a good idea for startups, too \u00e2\u0080\u0093 one CEO we spoke with saved ~$10 million annually by switching from AWS to their own GPU boxes hosted in colocation facilities. The key question for founders is to determine at what scale cost savings justify the maintenance burden \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and how quickly cloud price curves will come down.</p>\n<p><strong>Compress, compile, and optimize.</strong> As models continue to get bigger, techniques to support efficient inference and training \u00e2\u0080\u0093 including quantization, <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.01108\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">distillation</a>, <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.03635\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">pruning</a>, and <a href=\"https://tvm.apache.org/about\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">compilation</a> \u00e2\u0080\u0093 are becoming essential. They are also increasingly available through pre-trained models or automated APIs. These tools will not change the economics of most AI problems but can help manage costs at scale.</p>\n<p><strong>Test, test, test.</strong> This may sound obvious, but several experts encouraged ML teams to make testing a priority \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and not based on classical mechanisms like F score. Machine learning applications often perform (and fail) in non-deterministic ways. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBugs\u00e2\u0080\u009d can be unintuitive, introduced through bad data, precision mismatches, or implicit privacy violations. Upgrades also routinely touch dozens of applications, and backward compatibility isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t available. These problems require robust testing of data distributions, expected drift, bias, adversarial tactics, and other factors yet to be codified.</p>\n<p>\u2014</p>\n<p>Artificial intelligence and machine learning are only beginning to emerge from their formative stage \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and the peak of the hype cycle \u00e2\u0080\u0093 into a period of more practical, efficient development and operations. There is still a huge amount of work to do around the long tail and other issues, in some sense reinventing the familiar constructs of software development. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s unlikely the economics of AI will ever quite match traditional software. But we hope this guide will help advance the conversation and spread some great advice from experienced AI builders.</p>\n<div class=\"widget widget--subscribe widget--subscribe-inline widget--subscribe-theme-default\" data-subscribe-instance=\"1\">\n<div id=\"widget-signup-form-1\">\n<h3 class=\"widget__title\"><span>The enterprise is changing</span></h3>\n<p>Sign up for our enterprise newsletter to get the a16z take on the trends reshaping B2B and enterprise tech.</p>\n<div class=\"input-wrap\">\n<form class=\"mktoForm\" data-formid=\"1564\" data-forminstance=\"subscribe-inline-content-1\" data-thankyou-container=\"#widget-signup-form-1\" data-thankyou-message=\"#widget-signup-ty-1\" id=\"mktoForm-1564\" target=\"_blank\"></form>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"thankyou-message\" id=\"widget-signup-ty-1\" style=\"display: none\">\n<div class=\"thankyou-message-inner\">\n<h4>Thanks for signing up.</h4>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p><em>We would like to extend a HUGE thank you to everyone who responded to our last post and provided insights for this one, including (quote attributions in parentheses): Aman Naimat (*), Shubho Sengupta, Nikon Rasumov, Vitaly Gordon (**), Hassan Sawaf (***), Adam Bly, Manohar Paluri, Jeet Mehta, Subash Sundaresan, Alex Holub, Evan Reiser, Zayd Enam, Evan Sparks, Mitul Tiwari, Ihab Ilyas, Kevin Guo, Chris Padwick, and Serkan Piantino.</em></p>\n<p>\u2014</p>\n<p><em>The views expressed here are those of the individual AH Capital Management, L.L.C.

The reasons are many (and will be the topic of a future blog post). As a result, we spend a great deal of time thinking about the characteristics required to be a founding CEO. Perhaps the most important attribute required to be a successful founding CEO is leadership. So what is leadership and how do we think about it in the context of the CEO job? Are great leaders born or made?</p>\n<p>Most people define leadership in the same way that Supreme Court Justice Potter Stewart famously defined pornography when he said: \u00e2\u0080\u009cI know it when I see it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d</p>\n<p>A better definition comes from former Secretary of State Colin Powell who said: \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou have achieved excellence as a leader when people will follow you anywhere if only out of curiosity.\u00e2\u0080\u009d For our purposes, we can generalize this to be the measure of the quality of a leader: the quantity, quality and diversity of people who want to follow her.</p>\n<p>So what makes people want to follow a leader? We look for 3 key traits:</p>\n<p>1. The ability to articulate the vision</p>\n<p>2. The right kind of ambition</p>\n<p>3. The ability to achieve the vision</p>\n<p>Let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s take these in order.</p>\n<h2>The ability to articulate the vision\u00e2\u0080\u0094The Steve Jobs Attribute</h2>\n<p>Can the leader articulate a vision that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s interesting, dynamic, and compelling? More importantly, can the leader do this when things fall apart? More specifically, when the company gets to a point when it does not make objective financial sense for any employee to continue working there, will the leader be able to articulate a vision that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s compelling enough that the people stay out of curiosity?</p>\n<p>I believe that Jobs\u00e2\u0080\u0099 greatest achievement as a visionary leader so far was a) getting so many super talented people to continue following him at NeXT, long after the company lost its patina; then b) getting the employees of Apple to buy into his vision when the company was weeks away from bankruptcy. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s difficult to imagine any other leader being so compelling that they could do these back-to-back and this is why we call this one the Steve Jobs attribute.</p>\n<h2>The right kind of ambition\u00e2\u0080\u0094The Bill Campbell Attribute</h2>\n<p>Andy Grove once remarked that a company needs highly ambitious executives in order to achieve its goals. However, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s critical that those executives have \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe right kind of ambition\u00e2\u0080\u009d: ambition for the success of the company rather than the \u00e2\u0080\u009cwrong kind of ambition\u00e2\u0080\u009d: ambition for the success of themselves.</p>\n<p>One of the biggest misperceptions in our society is that a prerequisite for becoming a CEO is being selfish, ruthless, and callous. In fact, the opposite is true and the reason is obvious. The first thing that any successful CEO must do is get really great people to work for her. Smart people do not want to work for people who do not have their interests in mind and in heart.</p>\n<p>Most of us have experienced this in our careers: a bright, ambitious, hard working executive that nobody good wants to work for and who, as a result, delivers performance far worse than one might imagine.</p>\n<p>Truly great leaders create an environment where the employees feel that the CEO cares much more about the employees than she cares about herself. In this kind of environment, an amazing thing happens: a huge number of the employees believe that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\u00c2\u00a0<em style=\"font-size:12px;\">their</em> company and behave accordingly. As the company grows large, these employees become the quality control for the entire organization. They set the standard of work that all future employees must live up to. As in, \u00e2\u0080\u009cHey, you need to do a better job on that datasheet\u00e2\u0080\u0094you are screwing up my company.\u00e2\u0080\u009d</p>\n<p>I call this characteristic the Bill Campbell attribute after\u00c2\u00a0<a href=\"http://money.cnn.com/2008/07/21/technology/reingold_coach.fortune/index.htm\">my friend Bill</a> who is the best that I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve ever seen at this. If you talk to people who worked in any of the many organizations that Bill has run, they refer to those organizations as \u00e2\u0080\u009cmy organization\u00e2\u0080\u009d or \u00e2\u0080\u009cmy company.\u00e2\u0080\u009d A huge part of why he has been so unbelievably strong on this dimension of leadership is that he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s totally authentic. He would happily sacrifice his own economics, fame, glory, and rewards for his employees. When you talk to Bill, you get the feeling that he cares deeply about you and what you have to say, because he does. And all of that shows up in his actions and follow through.</p>\n<h2>Ability to achieve the vision\u00e2\u0080\u0094The Andy Grove Attribute</h2>\n<p>The final leg of our leadership stool is competence, pure and simple. If I buy into the vision and believe that the leader cares about me, do I think she can actually achieve the vision? Will I follow her into the jungle with no map forward or back and trust that she will get me out of there?</p>\n<p>I like to refer to this as the Andy Grove attribute. Andy Grove will always be my model of CEO competence. He earned a Ph.D. in electrical engineering, wrote the best management book that I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve ever read (<em><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/High-Output-Management-Andrew-Grove/dp/0679762884\">High Output Management<img alt=\"\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/i.ixnp.com/images/v6.24/t.gif\"/></a></em>), and tirelessly refined his craft. Not only did he write exceptional books on management, he taught management classes at Intel throughout his tenure.</p>\n<p>In his classic book,\u00c2\u00a0<em><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Only-Paranoid-Survive-Andrew-Grove/dp/0385482582\">Only the Paranoid Survive<img alt=\"\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/i.ixnp.com/images/v6.24/t.gif\"/></a></em>, Grove details the story of leading Intel through the dramatic transition from the memory business to the microprocessor business. In doing so, he walked away from nearly all of his revenue. He humbly credits others in the company with coming to the strategic conclusion before he did, but the credit for swiftly and successfully leading the company through the transition goes to Dr. Grove. Changing your primary business as a 16 year old, large, public company raises a lot of questions. As Andy describes in an incident with one of his employees:</p>\n<blockquote><p>One of them attacked me aggressively, asking, \u00e2\u0080\u009cDoes it mean that you can conceive of Intel without being in the memory business?\u00e2\u0080\u009d I swallowed hard and said, \u00e2\u0080\u0098yes, I guess I can.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 All hell broke loose.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Despite shocking many of his best employees with this radical strategy, ultimately the company trusted Andy. They trusted him to rebuild their company around an entirely new business. And that trust turned out to be very well placed.</p>\n<h2>So, are great leaders born or made?</h2>\n<p>Let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s look at this one attribute at a time:</p>\n<p><strong>Articulation of the vision</strong>\u00e2\u0080\u0094There is no question that some people are much better story tellers than others.

Programmable blockchains are interesting for the same reason that innovation on smartphones spiked after opening up development to third parties via app stores. We are now seeing waves of brilliant, creative people building new products and services on top of blockchains that are disrupting industries and reaching mainstream adoption. DeFi was the first wave of blockchain killer apps that broke out about a year ago, followed by NFTs and crypto gaming experiences this year. What comes next is hard to predict, but DAOs (decentralized autonomous organizations) are likely to have an enormous impact on the adoption of web3 products.\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">DAOs are internet-native, global collectives that share resources, build products, and work together toward common goals. To appreciate what is so powerful about this new method of organizing communities and aligning incentives to funnel creative energy, let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s look at history. Venice is known as a focal point of the Italian Renaissance, but almost none of the most groundbreaking inventions of the age originated there. Double-entry bookkeeping was imported from the Levant. The Arabic numerals that made it possible were originally from India. The industrial advances used to run the whole operation came from China.\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">What Venice did have\u00e2\u0080\u0094and became renowned for\u00e2\u0080\u0094was a radically elevated merchant class with ownership and representation in government, which enabled them to assemble the best of the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s resources. New ideas, concepts, and inventions could be combined, organized, scaled, and sometimes even reinvented in Venice. The result was explosive: in the 13th century, Venice became the richest and most powerful city in Europe, and despite dozens of regime changes (amazingly, the heads of state were called \u00e2\u0080\u009cDoges\u00e2\u0080\u009d), it was able to hold this title for hundreds of years.\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In addition to borderless resource assembly, DAOs also enable bottom-up innovation and community building, from which new ideas can be incubated and scaled. A more recent historical comparison is the Homebrew Computer Club, a Silicon Valley forum for sharing ideas where Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak debuted the first Apple computer in 1976. Truly disruptive innovations often look like toys at the outset, and emerge when groups of smart people get together and collaborate on hobbies they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re passionate about.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">What we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re seeing in web3 feels familiar in many ways. Today, artists are using NFTs to capture the full value of their work. Talented engineers with only an internet connection are contributing to the most important blockchain infrastructure, regardless of their age, gender, or pedigree. Like Venice did for early modern Europe, web3 is redefining how global talent pools their knowledge and work together. And like the Homebrew Computer Club in the 1970s, communities of smart, passionate, \u00e2\u0080\u009chobbyists\u00e2\u0080\u009d are gathering in forums to tinker with a new set of primitives to build groundbreaking products and experiences. Those communities are being organized today via DAOs, the web3 group coordination primitive.\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Until recently, DAOs were used mostly to secure DeFi protocols, and DAO members consisted primarily of highly technical contributors. </span><a href=\"https://www.fwb.help/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">FWB</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> (Friends With Benefits) represents a new kind of DAO. Founded initially as a token-gated Discord server, FWB has become the de facto home of web3\u00e2\u0080\u0099s growing creative class. Joining FWB requires a written application, which the community itself reviews and votes on, as well as a minimum buy-in of $FWB tokens, which represent meaningful ownership in the DAO. In addition to capturing the upside of the DAO\u00e2\u0080\u0099s creative output, the tokens come with governing power over a community treasury. By aligning the incentives of the next generation of artists, creators, and builders, FWB is enabling a different kind of renaissance for the next evolution of the internet. Fittingly, they describe themselves as a digital city.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">We have long believed the creative class is among the most under-monetized talent pools in web2, driving the vast majority of the cultural value and capturing little of it in return. The average American consumer spends a third of their waking hours streaming music, and yet only 1% of music artists are able to make a living through streaming. Crypto offers a dramatically more incentive-aligned way for creatives to monetize their passions, but we also recognize that the adoption hurdles have remained significant. FWB serves as the port city of web3, introducing a culturally influential class to crypto by putting human capital first.\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Since its humble beginnings as a social experiment in September 2020, FWB has grown to nearly 2000 members and its community has driven an outsized portion of the cultural value in web3. DAO members have launched a (now canonical)</span><a href=\"https://fwb.mirror.xyz/XU5_RYsow8fDbbckryr2snNyfrMV8HTJ0N39Cjkfy3s\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> token-gated events app</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, </span><a href=\"https://gallery.fwb.help/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">an NFT gallery</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, a web3-focused </span><a href=\"https://www.fwb.help/wip\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">editorial venture</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, a virtual music studio, and a </span><a href=\"https://www.fwb.help/pulse\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">real-time community dashboard</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, in addition to a series of </span><a href=\"https://www.fwb.help/wip/fwb-paris\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">parties</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> around the world. Their next venture, FWB Cities, aims to scale the DAO\u00e2\u0080\u0099s IRL footprint, partnering with city-specific spaces, communities, and experiences to bring real world benefits to the FWB membership. In this way, FWB Cities offers a glimpse into the very first IRL metaverse and will make the entry fee even more accessible to more people.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Because of FWB, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s now possible to envision a world where the first time you interact with crypto is when you walk into a bar or attend your friend\u00e2\u0080\u0099s concert. Our goal is to offer guidance as FWB navigates the complexities that come with the next phase of DAO maturity. We plan to actively </span><a href=\"https://a16z.com/2021/08/26/open-sourcing-our-token-delegate-program/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">participate in governance</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> and we will empower key community members through delegation. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re thrilled to be a part of the FWB community as they lead the charge toward mainstream adoption of web3.</span></p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p><em>The views expressed here are those of the individual AH Capital Management, L.L.C.

Led by our crypto data scientist, Eddy Lazzarin, we analyzed 10 years of data, including Reddit comments in crypto subreddits, Github commits in crypto repos, and Pitchbook funding data (more on the methodology below). The results are shown in the following charts.</span></p>\n<p><b>The First Cycle: 2009-2012</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The first crypto cycle peaked in 2011. Before this, even enthusiasts thought of Bitcoin as an interesting experiment that was unlikely to have practical value. Afterwards, entrepreneurs realized you could create businesses in crypto. This was when many of today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s largest exchanges, miners, and wallets were founded.</span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Cycle1.jpg?ssl=1\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-300310\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"566\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Cycle1.jpg?resize=1024%2C566&amp;ssl=1\" width=\"1024\"/></a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Notice how developer, social media, and startup activity is sustained even after prices decline. As we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll see later, this is a consistent pattern that leads to long-term steady growth in fundamental innovation.</span></p>\n<p><b>The Second Cycle: 2012-2016</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The second cycle, which peaked in late 2013, is probably the first time most people outside of tech heard about Bitcoin. This cycle brought roughly 10x more developers and startups into the space. It was also when important projects were created and funded, most notably Ethereum, which drove a lot of the excitement in the third cycle in 2017. A key feature of crypto cycles is that each one plants seeds which later grow and drive the next cycle.</span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Cycle2.jpg?ssl=1\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-300311\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"565\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Cycle2.jpg?resize=1024%2C565&amp;ssl=1\" width=\"1024\"/></a></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><b>The Third Cycle: 2016-2019</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The third cycle, reaching its peak in 2017, is when the broader implications of crypto captured mainstream attention. This cycle again increased the number of developers and startups in the space by another roughly 10x.

The 2017 cycle spawned dozens of exciting projects in a wide range of areas including payments, finance, games, infrastructure, and web apps. Many of these projects are launching in the near future, possibly driving a fourth crypto cycle.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Finally, here are the compound annual growth rates for each metric from 2010 to the present:</span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/CAGR-Graphic2.jpg?ssl=1\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-300309\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"682\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/CAGR-Graphic2.jpg?resize=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1\" width=\"1024\"/></a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Even though crypto cycles look chaotic, over the long term they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve generated steady growth of new ideas, code, projects, and startups \u2014 the fundamental drivers of software innovation.

Yes, the budgeting process. How ridiculous is that? How does it happen and why is it particularly problematic for engineers?</p>\n<p>I\u2019ll begin by describing how I screwed it up in my company. Our sales were growing so fast that the biggest problem that we faced was that we literally could not handle all the customers that wanted to sign up for Loudcloud. To combat this and enable us to grow, I worked diligently with my team to plan all the activities that we needed to accomplish to expand our capacity and capture the market before the competition. Next, I assigned sub-goals and activities to each functional head. In conjunction with my leadership team, I made sure that each goal was measurable and supported by paired metrics as well as lagging and leading indicators. I then told the team to figure out what it would take to accomplish those goals and return with their requirements for headcount and program dollars. Finally, I made adjustments to their requests based on industry benchmarks (mostly reductions) to get to a plan that I thought made sense.</p>\n<p>Here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the basic process:</p>\n<p>1. Set goals that will enable us to grow</p>\n<p>2. Break the goals down so that there is clear ownership and accountability for each goal by a specific team</p>\n<p>3. Refine goals into measurable targets</p>\n<p>4. Figure out how many new people are required to hit the targets</p>\n<p>5. Estimate the cost of the effort</p>\n<p>6. Benchmark against the industry</p>\n<p>7. Make global optimizations</p>\n<p>8. Execute</p>\n<p>Unless you are an experienced manager, you may not even see what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s wrong with this process, but it very nearly led to my company\u2019s demise. In fact, the above process is completely upside-down and should only be followed if you wish to bloat your company to the brink of bankruptcy and create a culture of chaos.</p>\n<p>When I asked my managers what they needed, I unknowingly\u00c2\u00a0<em>gamified</em>\u00c2\u00a0the budgeting process. The game worked as follows: The objective was for each manager to build the largest organization possible and thereby expand the importance of his function. Through the transitive property of status, he could increase his own importance as well. Now you may be thinking, \u201cThat wouldn\u2019t happen in my company. Most of my staff would never play that game.\u201d Well, that\u2019s the beauty of the game. It only takes one player to opt in, because once someone starts playing, everybody is going in \u2014 and they are going in hard.</p>\n<p>Gameplay quickly becomes sophisticated as managers develop clever strategies and tactics to improve their chances for winning. One common game technique is to dramatically expand the scope of the goals: \u201cWhen you said that you wanted to increase our market presence, I naturally assumed that you meant globally. Surely, you wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want me to take a U.S.-centric view.\u201d To really motivate the CEO, another great technique involves claiming dire circumstances if the company fails to achieve its metrics: \u201cIf we don\u2019t increase sales by 500% and our top competitor does, we will fall behind. If we fall behind, we will no longer be No. 1. If we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not No. 1, then we won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be able to hire the best people, command the best prices, or build the best product, and we will spin into a death spiral.\u201d Never mind the fact that there is almost no chance that your competitor will grow 500% this year.</p>\n<p>Another subtle problem with this process is that when I asked my team what they needed to achieve their goals, they naturally assumed they would get it. As a result, my team deeply socialized their ideas and newly found money with their teams. This has the added gaming benefit of inextricably tying their demands to company morale. When the VP of marketing asked me for 10 headcount and $5M in program expenses, then shared that plan with his team, it changed the conversation. Now a major cutback to his plan would alarm his team because they had just spent two weeks planning for a much more positive scenario. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWow, Ben greatly reduced the plan. Should I be looking for a job?\u00e2\u0080\u009d This kind of dynamic put pressure on me to create a more expansive expense plan than was wise. Multiply this by all my managers and I was on my way to burning up all my cash and destroying my culture.</p>\n<p>My core problem was that my budgeting process did not have any real constraints. We were private and did not have a specific profit target that we needed to hit and we had plenty of cash in the bank. Drawing the line on expenses seemed rather arbitrary. In the absence of a hard constraint, I had no constraint.</p>\n<p>An excellent constraining principle when planning your budget is the preservation of cultural cohesion. The enemy of cultural cohesion is super-fast headcount growth. Companies that grow faster than doubling their headcount annually tend to have serious cultural drift, even if they do a great job of onboarding new employees and training them. Sometimes this kind of growth is necessary and manageable in certain functions like sales, but is usually counterproductive in other areas where internal communication is critical like engineering and marketing. If you quadruple your engineering headcount in a year, you will likely have less absolute throughput than if you doubled headcount. As an added bonus, you will burn way more cash. Even worse, you will lose cultural consistency as new people with little guidance will come in with their own way of doing things that doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t match your way of doing things. Note that this does not apply to you if you have very small numbers. It\u2019s fine to grow engineering from one to four people or from two to eight. However, if you try to grow from 50 to 200, you will cause major issues if you are not extremely careful.</p>\n<p>Starting with the cultural cohesion principle, a far better way to run the budgeting process is to start with the constraints. Some useful constraints are:</p>\n<p><strong>Run rate increase</strong>\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u0093 Note that I say \u201crun rate increase\u201d and not \u201cspend increase\u201d. You should set a limit on the amount by which you are willing to increase what you are spending in the last month of the coming year vs. the previous year.</p>\n<p><strong>Earnings/Loss</strong>\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u0093 If you have revenue, another great constraint is your targeted earnings or loss for the year.</p>\n<p><strong>Engineering growth rate</strong>\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u0093 Unless you are making an acquisition and running it separately or sub-dividing engineering in some novel way, you should strive not to more than double a monolithic engineering organization in a 12-month period.</p>\n<p><strong>Ratio of engineering to other functions</strong>\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u0093 Once you have constrained engineering, then you can set ratios between engineering and other functions to constrain them as well.</p>\n<p>After applying the global constraints, the following steps will provide a better process:</p>\n<p>1. Take the constrained number that you created and reduce it by 10-25% to give yourself room for expansion, if necessary.</p>\n<p>2. Divide the budget created above in the ratios that you believe are appropriate across the team.</p>\n<p>3. Communicate the budgets to the team.</p>\n<p>4. Run your goal-setting exercise and encourage your managers to demonstrate their skill by achieving great things within their budgets.</p>\n<p>5. If you believe that more can legitimately be achieved in a group with more money, then allocate that manager extra budget out of the slush fund you created with the 10-25%.</p>\n<p>At this point, some readers may think that I\u2019ve lost my mind. As a technologist, you know that the worst thing that you can do is over-constrain the problem before you start. You\u2019ll kill creativity and prevent yourself from getting a truly great outcome. That\u2019s precisely why I, as an engineer, struggled with this process: the human factors muck up the logic. Specifically, local incentives, if not properly managed, will sharply motivate human behavior and defeat the global goals.</p>\n<p>It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s critical to recognize this so that you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t turn your agile, small company into a slow, big company before its time.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The views expressed here are those of the individual AH Capital Management, L.L.C.

Advances in cloud streaming and AI will enable new forms of engagement with friends\u00e2\u0080\u0094for example, the ability to pop into a persistent virtual world and discover new people and experiences together, entirely unplanned. This represents a subtle but important shift in how we socialize and play: from </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">purposeful</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> interactions centered around </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">activities</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, to </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">spontaneous</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> interactions focused on </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">people</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">.\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen glimmers of these spontaneous interactions already in open-world, sandbox video games like </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Grand Theft Auto</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, yet these experiences have been limited by a finite supply of professionally created content. Fully emergent social experiences that model the serendipity of the real world will become the norm through two key trends: <strong>the proliferation of user-generated content</strong> (UGC) and <strong>the evolution of AI</strong> into both creator tool and companion.

In comparison, a true Metaverse would likely be composed of several galaxies of Star Wars-sized virtual worlds.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">User-generated content offers a promising solution for cost-effectively scaling content production. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Platforms such as YouTube and Twitch have assembled vast content libraries faster and more efficiently than any professional studio. YouTube serves over </span><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/about/press/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">1 billion hours of video daily</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> via a community of </span><a href=\"https://www.tubics.com/blog/number-of-youtube-channels/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">31 million channel creators</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">.

These platforms harness the collective creative energy of their communities to create an endless flywheel of content.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Yet UGC platforms have their own challenges, as well. Maintaining a high quality bar can be difficult, given the sheer volume of content being created. And due to the need for users to learn new tools and programming skills, content creators tend to be vastly outnumbered by consumers. YouTube\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 31 million creators represent only 1.2 percent of its 2 billion monthly user base. 3D game engines such as Unity and Unreal are powerful, but can be difficult to learn. Unity, for example, is used by only </span><a href=\"https://venturebeat.com/2020/08/24/unity-files-for-ipo-reveals-163-million-loss-for-2019-and-1-5-million-monthly-users/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">1.5 million</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> monthly creators today, a fraction of the </span><a href=\"https://venturebeat.com/2020/05/08/newzoo-2-7-billion-gamers-will-spend-159-3-billion-on-games-in-2020/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">2.7 billion</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> gamers worldwide.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">UGC created by a small segment of human creators, while a meaningful step forward from professionally-created studio content, is likely only one side of the coin that we need to build the Metaverse and its new social systems.</span></p>\n<div class=\"widget widget--subscribe widget--subscribe-inline widget--subscribe-theme-default\" data-subscribe-instance=\"1\">\n<div id=\"widget-signup-form-1\">\n<h3 class=\"widget__title\"><span>The inside take on the future of tech.</span></h3>\n<p>Sign up for the a16z newsletter to learn about the tech trends reshaping our world and the people behind them.</p>\n<div class=\"input-wrap\">\n<form class=\"mktoForm\" data-formid=\"1560\" data-forminstance=\"subscribe-inline-content-1\" data-thankyou-container=\"#widget-signup-form-1\" data-thankyou-message=\"#widget-signup-ty-1\" id=\"mktoForm-1560\" target=\"_blank\"></form>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"thankyou-message\" id=\"widget-signup-ty-1\" style=\"display: none\">\n<div class=\"thankyou-message-inner\">\n<h4>Thanks for signing up.</h4>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<h2><b>AI as the co-creator</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In order to enable emergent social experiences inside a Metaverse\u00e2\u0080\u0094similar to how we discover experiences in the real world today\u00e2\u0080\u0094there needs to be a vast increase in both the quantity and quality of user-generated content.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">To this end, the next major evolution in content creation will be a shift toward AI-assisted human creation (phase 3). Whereas only a small number of people can be creators today, this AI-supplemented model will fully democratize content creation. Everyone can be a creator with the help of AI tools that can translate high-level instructions into production-ready assets, doing the proverbial heavy lifting of coding, drawing, animation, and more.\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re already seeing early glimpses of this in action.

AI-driven graphics creation has been more challenging than text and audio due to exponentially larger asset sizes and computational requirements. Yet we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re already seeing tantalizing signs of a future where creators will be able to use AI to fully render 3D characters and worlds. Nvidia recently unveiled </span><a href=\"https://developer.nvidia.com/maxine\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Maxine</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, an AI video conferencing platform that employs generative adversarial networks (GANs) to analyze a person\u00e2\u0080\u0099s face and then algorithmically animate in video calls. This model can enable dynamic effects such as simulated eye contact and real-time speech translation. In an even more ambitious approach, RCT\u00e2\u0080\u0099s </span><a href=\"https://rct-studio.com/en-us/blog/morpheus-intro\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Morpheus Engine</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> uses deep reinforcement learning to render text into 3D assets and animations from a library of natural world objects.

Both the quantity and quality of UGC will improve as these tools are adopted. And over time, as AI models improve, the quality of emergent, AI-created content may one day even surpass the caliber of human-created content, paving the way for a shift in how we socialize and spend time in virtual worlds.</span></p>\n<h2><b>Spontaneous social experiences will become the new norm</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In an AI-powered Metaverse filled with a near-infinite supply of rich content, the way we socialize will also evolve. With worlds at our fingertips, socializing will </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">shift from the purposeful </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">what</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> to the people-centric </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">who</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. Instead of making plans around specific entertainment activities, as is frequently the case today, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be free to explore the virtual realm as a shared experience with friends\u00e2\u0080\u0094and trust the AI to fill in the rest.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">One analogy for this behavioral model is YouTube. Today you can visit YouTube without knowing exactly what videos you plan to watch. You can take a random \u00e2\u0080\u009cwalk\u00e2\u0080\u009d through a nearly endless catalog of user-generated content. In a similar fashion, the Metaverse will be </span><a href=\"https://a16z.com/2020/11/16/cloud-gaming/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">YouTube for social experiences</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u00e2\u0080\u0094a place where we can meet and discover new experiences without an agenda. Seem farfetched? Teens in the US are already </span><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/teens-in-us-spend-more-time-on-youtube-than-netflix-2019-10\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">spending more time watching YouTube than Netflix</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Cloud streaming combined with AI-powered characters will also create new formats of social experiences that are both spontaneous and interactive.

In the HBO show, human guests to the park interact with hosts, artificially created humanoid beings programmed with personalities and backstories. The hosts react dynamically to guest behavior, resulting in emergent narratives and a world that evolves in real-time based on the cumulative choices of guests.\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Our friends themselves will evolve in the Metaverse, as well. Most games today clearly separate human players and non-player characters (NPCs) who act out pre-scripted dialogue. The next evolution of NPCs in the Metaverse will likely be bots powered by AI models with natural language processing and cloud-connected data. Similar to the lifelike hosts in Westworld, a new friend in the future may very well be an AI.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re already seeing early previews of AI friendships.

Video. Podcasts. Newsletters.", "crawled": true, "body": "\n<p>The history of technology could be told simply as a story of things getting smaller, faster, and cheaper, which in turn opens up opportunity to more people too. Just think about the history of computing, which went from big mainframes accessible only to a select few, to personal computers, to mobile phones accessible to many.</p>\n<p>But even as we pass 2.5 billion smartphones on earth and head towards 5 billion, we still don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have connectivity everywhere. The reason we haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t done so is that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a difficult problem. Put simply, getting internet access to a remote region requires significant up-front effort and cost that underdeveloped and sparsely populated areas are unable to bear. This is because the only practical methods for bringing broadband to an area are to trench fiber, set up point-to-point microwave towers, or send massive half-billion dollar satellites into space and as a result, charge exceedingly high rates.</p>\n<p>I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve experienced this directly over the last few years bringing broadband internet to indigenous communities in the United States as part of a non-profit I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m involved with. The problem of rural access is so complicated that even in the nation that birthed the internet, less than 20% of populations have connectivity in some rural tribal areas.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, recent advances in both communication and space technologies promise to give us viable solutions to address the problem. To that end, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m absolutely thrilled to announce our investment in Astranis, Andreessen Horowitz\u00e2\u0080\u0099s first investment in space. The company has put together the right technology and strategy to offer broadband connectivity anywhere on earth at a small fraction of what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s possible using traditional satellites.</p>\n<p>The \u00e2\u0080\u009cmicro-satellite\u00e2\u0080\u009d movement has long promised to offer practical solutions for global internet coverage. However, most efforts have focused on constellations of hundreds or thousands low-earth orbit (LEO) satellites whizzing across the sky. While such a solution may be possible over time \u2014 it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a huge problem and market \u2013doing so requires a full constellation of satellites in order to provide continuous coverage over any one location, and a significant amount of coordination for hand-offs to ensure continuity in service.</p>\n<p>What we love about the Astranis approach is that they have devised a solution that provides reliable, high-bandwidth coverage with each satellite they send into space.\u00c2\u00a0And they can build these satellites at a small fraction of what traditional satellites cost \u2014 well over 10x price reduction.\u00c2\u00a0They do this by taking advantage of a number of recent developments in both satellites and communications equipment, and placing a relatively small satellite in geosynchronous orbit where it will stay at a fixed point over any location on the planet.</p>\n<p>When we first heard the Astranis pitch, we weren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t sure we had sufficient context or background to make the investment. While we are comfortable with networking, this is space!\u00c2\u00a0However, over the following weeks, and with exceptional patience on the part of the team, we learned about the technology, the market opportunity, the regulatory and policy backdrop, spectrum requirements in this context, etc. and we came away big believers in the approach, and that this is the right team to do it.</p>\n<p>In addition with impressing us by having full command of the technology and the business, Co-founder and CEO John Gedmark co-founded and ran the Commercial Spaceflight Federation, where he played a significant role in the privatization of space technology in the U.S. under the Obama Administration. Astranis Cofounder and CTO Ryan McLinko is a veteran of multiple spacecraft programs; most recently, he led engineering teams at Planet, where he played a lead role in designing over 100 small satellites. And the rest of the team has deep experience hailing from companies such as SpaceX, Orbital, and Google.\u00c2\u00a0But our faith in the team isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t just based on their strong career track records, but their results; for instance, just a week ago, the Astranis team connected with a functional satellite they built and launched into space to demonstrate the core of their approach. Wow.</p>\n<p>I am honored to join the Astranis board. We feel very privileged to be able to share the vision and passion of this team,\u00c2\u00a0and to be their partners as they change the world \u2014 by connecting it.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The views expressed here are those of the individual AH Capital Management, L.L.C.

About half the responders chastised me, saying that one-on-ones were useless and that I shouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t put so much emphasis on them. The other half wanted to know how to run more effective one-on-ones. It seems to me that both groups are likely talking about two sides of the same coin.</p>\n<p>Perhaps the CEO\u00e2\u0080\u0099s most important operational responsibility is designing and implementing the communication architecture for her company. The architecture might include the organizational design, meetings, processes, email, yammer and even one-on-one meetings with managers and employees. Absent a well-designed communication architecture, information and ideas will stagnate and your company will degenerate into a bad place to work. While it is quite possible to design a great communication architecture without one-on-one meetings, in most cases one-on-ones provide an excellent mechanism for information and ideas to flow up the organization and should be part of your design.</p>\n<p>Generally, people who think one-on-one meetings are a bad idea have been victims of poorly designed one-on-one meetings. The key to a good one-on-one meeting is the understanding that it is the\u00c2\u00a0<em>employee\u00e2\u0080\u0099s</em>\u00c2\u00a0meeting rather than the manager\u00e2\u0080\u0099s meeting. This is the free-form meeting for all the pressing issues, brilliant ideas and chronic frustrations that do not fit neatly into status reports, email and other less personal and intimate mechanisms.</p>\n<p>If you are an employee, how do you get feedback from your manager on an exciting, but only 20% formed idea that you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not sure is relevant without sounding like a fool? How do you point out that a colleague that you do not know how to work with is blocking your progress without throwing her under the bus? How do you get help when you love your job, but your personal life is melting down? Through a status report? On email? Yammer? Asana? Really? For these and other important areas of discussions, one-on-ones can be essential.</p>\n<p>If you like structured agendas, then the employee should set the agenda. A good practice is to have the employee send you the agenda in advance. This will give her a chance to cancel the meeting if nothing is pressing. It also makes clear that it is her meeting and will take as much or as little time as she needs. During the meeting, since it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the employee\u00e2\u0080\u0099s meeting, the manager should do 10% of the talking and 90% of the listening. Note that this is the opposite of most one-on-ones.</p>\n<p>While it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not the manager\u00e2\u0080\u0099s job to set the agenda or do the talking, the manager should try to draw the key issues out of the employee. The more introverted the employee, the more important this becomes. If you manage engineers, drawing out issues will be an important skill to master.</p>\n<p>Some questions that I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve found to be very effective in one-on-ones:</p>\n<p><strong>If we could improve in any way, how would we do it?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>What\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the No. 1 problem with our organization? Why?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>What\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not fun about working here?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Who is really kicking ass in the company? Who do you admire?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>If you were me, what changes would you make?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>What don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you like about the product?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>What\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the biggest opportunity that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re missing out on?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>What are we not doing that we should be doing?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Are you happy working here?</strong></p>\n<p>In the end, the most important thing is that the best ideas, the biggest problems and the most intense employee life issues make their way to the people that can deal with them. One-on-ones are a time-tested way to do that, but if you have a better one, go ahead with your bad self.</p>\n", "author": "Ben Horowitz"}, "213": {"podcast": "a16z Podcast: Entrepreneurs, Then and Now | Andreessen Horowitz", "url": "https://a16z.com/2019/06/28/entrepreneurs-then-now-trends-decades-a16z-anniversary-ben-marc-stewart/", "contents": "As another repeat entrepreneur from then to now, guest host Stewart Butterfield, CEO of Slack, interviews the a16z co-founders in this special episode of the a16z Podcast to commemorate our...", "crawled": true, "body": "\n<iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"200\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://player.simplecast.com/8209626b-aa4e-451f-aba3-6e431c7e55a3?dark=true\" title=\"a16z Podcast: Entrepreneurs, Then and Now\" width=\"100%\"></iframe><ul class=\"bio-lp-subscribe__apps\" data-podcast-src=\"https://a16z.simplecast.com/episodes/a16z-podcast-entrepreneurs-then-and-now-wTL_lWGB?dark=true\"></ul><script>window.distribImages = {};window.distribChannels = [];window.distribImages[\"Apple Podcasts\"] = \"https://a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/bio-lp_apple-podcasts.png\";window.distribChannels.push(\"Apple Podcasts\");window.distribImages[\"Spotify\"] = \"https://a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/bio-lp_spotify.png\";window.distribChannels.push(\"Spotify\");window.distribImages[\"Stitcher\"] = \"https://a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Stitcher@2x.png\";window.distribChannels.push(\"Stitcher\");</script>\n<p>A lot in technology \u2014 and venture \u2014 happens in decades.

If a tool or technology is especially popular with the best engineers, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s worth watching those forums. The opinion of programmers often determines whether a technology gets built or not, or whether it comes through in startup recruiting or through open source development. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hard to imagine Linux being as successful as it has been\u00e2\u0080\u008a \u2014 without the willingness of enthusiastic developers dedicating hours of their free time in the early years.</p>\n<h5 class=\"graf--h4 graf-after--figure\" id=\"1dd3\">Telling a trend from a fad</h5>\n<p class=\"graf--p graf-after--h4\" id=\"93f4\">Once you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve built a pipeline of promising groups and information sources, how do you decide which ones are worth paying attention to?</p>\n<p class=\"graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"9643\">With breakout ideas in particular, the most important thing to notice are signs of rapid growth. If you have the data, anything over 5% weekly sustained growth is anomalous and worth paying attention to. The next best thing is to compare leading versus lagging indicators, because a big mismatch between the two is often a sign of rapid growth.</p>\n<p class=\"graf--p graf-after--p\">Lagging indicators are things like brand recognition, prestige, and perceived importance. Leading indicators are more intrinsic to the idea or product itself, like how much their users care about it, how much better it is than the alternatives, and the volume of positive chatter about it. An example of lagging indicators outweighing leading indicators could be a film like <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Avatar</em>, which had lots of marketing spend behind it, but appears to have had relatively limited cultural impact.</p>\n<p class=\"graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"ac0e\">When I came across early but rapidly growing trends, like bitcoin in 2011, or the Oculus Kickstarter, they felt incongruous. In both communities, users and developers were going crazy for the new technology, which seemed to be a real breakthrough. Both trends seemed way too important to be something nobody outside the niche seemed to care about. In other words, the leading indicators far outstripped the lagging ones.</p>\n<p class=\"graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"b54b\">The natural instinct for most people is to ignore or dismiss this feeling, but you can train yourself to pay attention to it. In these cases it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s important to act quickly, because if something\u00e2\u0080\u0099s growing really fast, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be common knowledge quite soon.</p>\n<h5 class=\"graf--h4 graf-after--p\" id=\"de52\">Spotting an important trend</h5>\n<p class=\"graf--p graf-after--h4\" id=\"79c4\">In the early days of a new idea, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s often the case that nobody is paying for anything. One way of guessing at economic impact, is by looking at \u00e2\u0080\u009cproxy for demand\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u008a \u2014 \u00e2\u0080\u008ahow much people will pay for similar alternatives\u00e2\u0080\u008a \u2014 \u00e2\u0080\u008aand on the other side, looking at \u00e2\u0080\u009cproxy for supply\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u008a\u2013 how expensive something was to produce before.</p>\n<p class=\"graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"fb73\">But it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s still tricky, because it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s so hard to estimate the economic changes brought by a disruptive technology. It can be dangerous to dismiss or embrace trends solely for this reason.</p>\n<p class=\"graf--p graf-after--figure\" id=\"ffc7\">Finally, while rapid exponential growth is a good sign, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not everything. Internet memes have huge growth as well. Most ideas that quickly attract a large audience are actually just fads, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s important to be able to pick out the important ones. One good sign is evidence of a \u00e2\u0080\u009c<a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"http://blakemasters.com/post/22866240816/peter-thiels-cs183-startup-class-11-notes\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">secret</a>\u00e2\u0080\u009d, or some plausible reasoning why this idea couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have manifested itself before now. With bitcoin, the secret is the technical breakthrough described in the bitcoin paper; where previous efforts at distributed trust and decentralized resourcing failed, it coupled bitcoin (incentives) with the blockchain protocol (distributed ledger) to solve those problems.</p>\n<p class=\"graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"aafe\">Of the fast growing, real trends, only a few have the potential to be really, dramatically, world-changing. Every year, there are only a few really important macro trends, and just a handful of them in computer science. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s unlikely a tech trend will be significant unless it benefits from one of these larger shifts, though it can do so in an oblique way. For instance, ridesharing apps were an important trend, but they were only enabled more broadly and recently by the larger trend of smartphones everywhere.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"pullquote\">\n<p class=\"graf--p graf-after--p\">how does one tell a trend\u00e2\u0080\u008a \u2014 \u00e2\u0080\u008asomething that continues to spread\u00e2\u0080\u008a \u2014 from a fad\u00e2\u0080\u008a \u2014 \u00e2\u0080\u008asomething that flares briefly and dies?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h5 class=\"graf--p graf-after--p\">Going mainstream</h5>\n<p class=\"graf--p graf-after--h4\" id=\"7639\">Having a breakthrough or a community of early adopters clearly isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t enough. So how does one tell a trend\u00e2\u0080\u008a \u2014 \u00e2\u0080\u008asomething that continues to spread\u00e2\u0080\u008a \u2014 from a fad\u00e2\u0080\u008a \u2014 \u00e2\u0080\u008asomething that flares briefly and dies? The key is it needs to spread beyond the group of early adopters to the rest of the world, and there needs to be a real pathway for this to happen.</p>\n<p class=\"graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"4b3c\">Before the internet, this path was from metropolitan centers, through the suburbs to the rest of the population. For ideas that spread purely online, the path could be through a big aggregator site like Reddit. Another pattern is spread by institutional similarity: Facebook was able to easily spread from Harvard to clusters of students in other schools, because of the structural similarity of most universities to each other despite other differences they may have.</p>\n<p class=\"graf--p graf-after--p\">Another path is by latching on to a different fast-growing community. In the 1990s, one of the big marketing successes of Sprite <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20150611005996/en/Sprite%C2%AE-Salutes-Legends-Hip-Hop-%E2%80%9CObey-Verse%E2%80%9D-Lyrical\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">was advertising to the hip-hop subculture</a> before it became mainstream. This type of path is especially important in technology, as subcultures that go through massive exponential growth are common. Targeting fast-growing communities is a common strategy for startups who want to see their userbase grow. Mobile developers were a niche group in 2007, but are a large, mainstream developer community now\u00e2\u0080\u008a \u2014 yet the today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s community still retains many of the tastes and technology preferences of the old one. Coolhunters can take the same approach but in reverse, by looking at fast growing communities and seeing what they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re using.</p>\n<span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe allowfullscreen=\"true\" class=\"youtube-player\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/qTtZM-dU-Bc?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" style=\"border:0;\" width=\"640\"></iframe></span>\n<p class=\"graf--p graf-after--p\">Whatever the path from early adopters to the mainstream may be, there are some qualities that some early adopters that help the idea spread. In the fashion world, social media marketers often target internet personalities who project an aspirational ideal, often by posting <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BCuAMUuTVA4/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Instagram-style pictures of food</a>, live events, etc.</p>\n<p>In technology, the kind of person who others want to copy may fit a different profile\u00e2\u0080\u008a \u2014 might be famous through open source, might be a prominent blogger\u00e2\u0080\u008a \u2014 but must have the same kind of influence. The same principle can apply to groups; Python programmers could be more influential than Java programmers, for example.</p>\n<h4 class=\"graf--h4 graf-after--p\" id=\"b965\">Adopting a contrarian view</h4>\n<p class=\"graf--p graf-after--h4\" id=\"cf0b\">You can get quite far in spotting new ideas just by watching developers, people in major cities or schools, other early adopters and tastemakers\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 but that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s where everyone\u00e2\u0080\u0099s looking.

As a startup, negotiating is tough because you are not yet established or trusted in the marketplace. When a customer buys a product from your company, they are taking on risk: risk that your startup may fail, leaving them with an unsupported product; risk that your product won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t work as advertised or that it will mismanage private data, open up security holes, infringe on IP, or cause collateral damage to other critical business systems; risk that your company won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t patch bugs on time or respond to support calls when issues arise; and so on.</p>\n<p>With all these risks, many founders and startups make the mistake of being overly accommodating during initial contract negotiations.\u00c2\u00a0The best approach, however, to writing a sales contract is to think of it as a system of interconnected components and levers that work together to achieve an acceptable level of risk and reward for both you and your customer. \u00e2\u0080\u009cPut everything on the table. Be open to negotiating everything as long as it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s within the acceptable boundaries. The customer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s got to give to get,\u00e2\u0080\u009d advises Mark Cranney, CRO at Signal Fx.</p>\n<p>To help startups navigate the risk and reward trade-offs of customer contracts, I interviewed lawyers, founders, and CROs about their experiences and what they learned about winning the deal without taking on contractual risk. In this post, I look at 16 of the most important sales contract clauses and how to approach each.</p>\n<h2>1. Warranties and Remedies</h2>\n<p>Warranty and remedy clauses are your first line of defense against unacceptable risk for your company. Warranties describe what your product will do and how it will work (\u00e2\u0080\u009cconforming to spec\u00e2\u0080\u009d) as well as what your Service Level Agreement (SLA) covers. Remedies describe how you will compensate the customer if your product does not work as defined by the warranties. By clearly defining your warranties and remedies, you avoid the risk of an unhappy customer suing you for damages when your product breaks down or does not work as expected.</p>\n<h3>Key Questions</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>What will your product do and how will it work?</li>\n<li>What kind of performance guarantees (e.g. uptime) should the customer expect?</li>\n<li>How will the customer be compensated in case these expectations are not met?</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Significance</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Protects you from being sued for covered issues</li>\n<li>Sets customer expectations and improves satisfaction</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Execution</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Specify warranties as clearly and completely as possible. Incomplete warranties can leave gaps for which you can be sued.</li>\n<li>A warranty should typically come with a specific, limited remedy. \u00e2\u0080\u009cProviding warranties without specific remedies is problematic because it opens you up to all available remedies, including termination of contract and indemnification. Make sure your remedies are specific and limited,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says Stacey Giamalis, Chief Legal Officer at PagerDuty.</li>\n<li>Remedies should be limited to credits on product usage (e.g. 1 month free) or some other forward-looking discount.</li>\n<li>Remedies specified as money back to customers may have revenue recognition implications. Accounting standards (FASB Standard: ASC 606) as of 2019 (2017 for public companies) require companies to constrain recognized revenue to the amount for which \u00e2\u0080\u009csufficient\u00e2\u0080\u009d confidence exists that no reversal will be made at a later date.</li>\n<li>\u00e2\u0080\u009cWarranties and remedies, limitations of liability, and indemnities are interrelated so read them together to make sure you understand your company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s full risk exposure. What you give in one section, you may be able to cap or limit in another,\u00e2\u0080\u009d advises Patty Downey, the Principal for Downey Legal Solutions.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>2. Limitations of Liability</h2>\n<p>The next most negotiated clause in the contract is the limitations of liability clause (aka LOL). Limitations of liability set a cap on how much you, as the vendor, can be sued for. Usually, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a general catch-all cap and a higher super cap for specific items related to negligence, misconduct, and breach of confidentiality.</p>\n<h3>Key Questions</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>If you are sued, how much can you be sued for?</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Significance</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Establishes the upper limits on how much money you can lose if you are sued</li>\n<li>Translates to the legal risk exposure an acquirer might have, so acquirers and investors look closely at limitations of liability</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Execution</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Both the general catch-all cap and the super cap are best negotiated as a multiple of fees paid in some previous time period. The standard clause is 1x the fees paid in the previous 12 or 24 months, and for certain other items, perhaps 2x those fees.</li>\n<li>Early stage startups with little negotiating leverage may be forced to negotiate caps that are absolute and unrelated to fees paid. These caps are often so high that paying them would be ruinous for the startup. In this case, Paul St. John, VP of Worldwide Sales at GitHub, suggested mitigating the risk: \u00e2\u0080\u009cBuy an insurance policy that covers the liability and split the cost of the insurance with the customer.\u00e2\u0080\u009d</li>\n<li>While renegotiation is tough, it is possible. Renegotiate limits after you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re more established and after you get an in-house general counsel. Dan Wright, AppDynamics COO and former General Counsel, relayed his own experience with renegotiations: \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt was brutal. We spent a year going through and renegotiating all those contracts. Customers are usually amenable to reason. It takes work, but it can happen.\u00e2\u0080\u009d</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>3. Indemnities</h2>\n<p>Indemnities provide an insurance policy for your customer in the event that they are sued for something related to their use of your product. For instance, if your product infringes on a third party\u00e2\u0080\u0099s intellectual property or mishandles private data, indemnities establish what your responsibility is. Damages that a customer might expect you to compensate them for can be direct, such as settlement amounts and legal fees, or indirect, such as reputational loss and business impact.</p>\n<h3>Key Questions</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>What\u00e2\u0080\u0099s your responsibility if your customer is sued because of their use of your product?</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Significance</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Just as limitations of liability protect you from legal exposure, indemnities protect your customers.</li>\n<li>Acquirers and investors eye these clauses carefully to assess their exposure if your customers get sued.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Execution</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Limit coverage to direct losses (e.g. legal and court fees). Avoid covering indirect losses, such as reputation or business impact. These are hard to quantify and can be significantly larger.<br/>\nRequire that you agree to any settlement amounts.</li>\n<li>Caps are determined by precedent in the market, so refer to what larger companies in your space are giving as indemnities.</li>\n<li>Some indemnity clauses might be completely uncapped such as IP infringement.</li>\n<li>Consider using geo-specific clauses for indemnities. Sowmya Bala, Associate General Counsel at PagerDuty, identifies this as a recent trend in SaaS sales contracts: \u00e2\u0080\u009cVendors are moving away from world-wide indemnification for IP infringement to geo-specific ones to be able to better manage and understand exposure.\u00e2\u0080\u009d</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>4. Entitlements</h2>\n<p>Entitlements establish boundaries around what the customer gets. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s important to have these boundaries so that you can later upsell the customer on new features/capabilities and experiment with packaging and pricing over the lifetime of the company.</p>\n<h3>Key Questions</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>What is the customer entitled to?</li>\n<li>What are the limits of those entitlements? Which features and updates are included? For how long?</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Significance</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>When an early stage company secures a potentially large deal, entitlements are important and prevent you from giving away the goose along with golden eggs.</li>\n<li>Limiting what the customer gets in a single transaction allows you to later upsell the customer on new features/capabilities and to change your pricing as you experiment with packaging and pricing over the lifetime of the company.</li>\n<li>Failing to deliver promised features can have revenue recognition implications, especially if a customer can cancel the contract. Entitlements can protect you from overpromising.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Execution</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Rely on your help/usage documentation for descriptions of what the product does, then \u00e2\u0080\u009ctie entitlements to whatever is in the documentation to make the definition tightly defined in order to protect the company\u2019s future revenue streams and IP,\u00e2\u0080\u009d suggests PagerDuty\u2019s Bala.</li>\n<li>Delineate between updates that existing customers have a right to (like security patches and bug fixes) and new features that might require additional payments. One way to do this is to define updates as what is available to other customers at no additional cost.</li>\n<li>Avoid promising to deliver certain features for a single customer, unless you are certain that it is needed by other customers and you are committed to working on it. Sometimes priorities change, and if the delivery of a feature is in the contract, you can find yourself having to return a large check.</li>\n<li>Make sure that your sales team does not add promised features, upgrades, or other entitlements in attached letters or Statements-of-Work (SOWs).</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>5. Data Use</h2>\n<p>With the rise of machine learning, the ability to train models based on customer data and reuse those models across customers is a strategic capability. At the same time, customers will often refuse to allow you to use their data due to privacy and litigation concerns. You need to think carefully about what it takes to win the contract and maintain a long-term strategic capability, then have a plan for negotiating with customers who are hesitant to share their data.</p>\n<h3>Key Questions</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>How can you use your customer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s data?</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Significance</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Data use is the foundation of strategic analytic capabilities.</li>\n<li>Your ability to use customer data can really impact how your company is valued and how it performs.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Execution</h3>\n<p>At a high level, there are three types of data use agreements:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>You own the data and can do whatever you want with it as long as it is not directly shared with other customers.</li>\n<li>Your customer owns the data, but you are free to train models on it and can reuse those models across customers.</li>\n<li>Your customer owns the data, and you are not allowed to reuse any derived works across customers</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>Large companies will often require the third option and not allow any use of their data or models trained using their data. Smaller companies will be more open to negotiate use of their data.</li>\n<li>When a company will not allow you to use their data, you can look at alternatives, such as charging them higher fees or limiting their access to models trained using data from other customers.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>6. Contract Term</h2>\n<p>Contract term defines the length of the contract. The length of the contract term should be based on your expectation of leverage in future contract negotiations. On the one hand, your product may become more business-critical to the buyer or they may want to expand significantly, thus increasing your leverage. On the other hand, the renewal or expansion revenue from the customer may become critical to making or breaking your numbers, thus decreasing your leverage. In general, if you expect more leverage in the future, you will want to negotiate shorter contract terms.</p>\n<h3>Key Questions</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>What is the contract length?</li>\n<li>Will the contract automatically renew?</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Significance</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>The contract term can help guarantee a level of income over a period of time, but it can also lock a startup into unfavorable terms and hinder your ability to renegotiate.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Execution</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>The contract term should be negotiated based on the expected changes in the value of your product to the customer and your leverage in negotiations.</li>\n<li>Longer-term contracts (usually multi-year) guarantee a level of income over a longer time period, but risk underpricing your products or compromising on certain clauses. A longer-term contract is preferable if renewal or expansion revenue from the customer is critical to making your numbers.</li>\n<li>A shorter-term contract is preferable if you expect the software to become business-critical to your customer or if you are significantly expanding your product\u00e2\u0080\u0099s capabilities.</li>\n<li>If you set a longer contract term, negotiate for payment upfront so you can invest it back into the business earlier. Make sure you have solid limitations of liability and indemnities clauses because of the larger exposure.</li>\n<li>PagerDuty\u2019s Giamalis gives this advice: \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re an early-stage startup, you may have deep discounts in your early contracts that you\u00e2\u0080\u0099d want to renegotiate sooner rather than later and your views on pricing and packaging are constantly changing. Be thoughtful about whether to include auto-renewal so you can force that renegotiation to happen.\u00e2\u0080\u009d</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>7. Publicity</h2>\n<p>Often overlooked, publicity is one of the more important clauses for early stage startups. Early stage companies should ask customers to participate in marketing activities, including displaying a customer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s logo in marketing materials, developing case studies and joint press releases with the customer, and quoting the customer in product testimonials. Unfortunately, publicity clauses are often the first that a sales rep will redline because they can cause friction in the sale. Luckily, there are tactics for making sure these make it into the final contract.</p>\n<h3>Key Questions</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Can you use the customer as a reference in marketing materials? If so, how?</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Significance</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>In the early life of a startup, customer references are extremely important for building credibility.</li>\n<li>Customers may hesitate on these clauses because they view them as additional work and don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to expose what software they use to the rest of the world.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Execution</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Large customers are often the hardest to work with. Some large global enterprise software companies are even known to refuse to participate in joint marketing activities unless the product is free for them.</li>\n<li>Allow sales reps to offer a discount as an incentive to the customer to participate in marketing activities, but make it a one-time discount, so as not to impact your leverage for the renewal negotiation.</li>\n<li>Alternatively, you can make securing customers for marketing activities part of your sales team\u00e2\u0080\u0099s quota or compensation structure. For example, Joyce Solano, CMO at Ironclad and previously SVP Marketing at Leanplum, calculated the ROI of a customer quote at Leanplum to be about $15k and was able to offer spiffs to sales reps who did get a customer quote.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>8. Source Code Escrow</h2>\n<p>This clause defines the terms under which a customer can access product source code. Large customers will sometimes negotiate source code escrow clauses to protect themselves in case your company disappears or terminates a product and they need to support the software themselves. In reality, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s very unlikely they would be able to do that, and these clauses are typically ones to avoid.</p>\n<h3>Key Questions</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Under what conditions does a customer get access to your product\u00e2\u0080\u0099s source code?</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Significance</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Source code escrow clauses create risk for a potential acquirer.</li>\n<li>These clauses can also create misalignment between the customer and the vendor and provide incentive for a customer to bankrupt you to gain ownership of your source code.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Execution</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Generally, startups should avoid source code escrow clauses like the plague.</li>\n<li>If you can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t avoid including a source code escrow clause, the terms must be very strictly defined. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMake sure it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s limited only to when the company goes bankrupt, and only in non-competitive uses, so your customer can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t bankrupt you and then turn around and resell your software,\u00e2\u0080\u009d explained AppDynamics\u2019 Wright.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>9. Most Favored Customer</h2>\n<p>The \u00e2\u0080\u009cMost Favored Customer\u00e2\u0080\u009d clause guarantees the customer the best price the vendor gives to anyone. Apple, for example, is known to require this from vendors.</p>\n<h3>Key Questions</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Does the vendor guarantee the customer the best price it gives anyone else?</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Significance</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Complying with this clause is operationally very difficult, especially for an early stage startup that doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t yet have good processes for tracking what prices are being given to what customers.</li>\n<li>This clause makes it very hard to give differentiated pricing to different customers.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Execution</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Patty Downey said in her experience customers sometimes try to sneak this clause in, so be careful when using a customer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s contract.</li>\n<li>Negotiate hard against this clause, and unless it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a major customer, flatly refuse it.</li>\n<li>If you have to accept it, restrict the definition of \u00e2\u0080\u009cother customers.\u00e2\u0080\u009d For example, you can make the clause apply only if the better pricing is given to a customer of a similar size in the same industry in the same geographic region with consistent liability terms.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>10. Assignment Provisions</h2>\n<p>Many startups are eventually acquired. If you are acquired, what does it mean for your customers? Assignment provisions set out in advance what happens to a sales contract if you are acquired.</p>\n<h3>Key Questions</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>If you are acquired, does your contract get assigned to your acquirer?</li>\n<li>Under what acquisition conditions does a customer not have to abide by a contract or certain contract clauses?</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Significance</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Customers may be concerned that your startup will be acquired by a competitor and want to mitigate risk with an assignment provision.</li>\n<li>An acquirer will lose revenue streams if customers leave and so assignment provisions can lead potential buyers to undervalue your company.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Execution</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>If a customer asks for assignment provisions, try to limit the clause to specific cases where you are acquired by a competitor and spell out who qualifies as competition in the contract.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>11. Termination for Convenience</h2>\n<p>Customers will often want the freedom to terminate the contract for any reason. The termination of convenience clause allows them to do this. Like source code escrow and most favored customer clauses, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s another one startups should avoid, if possible.</p>\n<h3>Key Questions</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Can customers terminate their contracts for no reason?</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Significance</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Termination for convenience clauses increase the risk of losing customers in the event that you are acquired. As a result it can lower your valuation by potential buyers.</li>\n<li>This clause can make revenue recognition difficult under the FASB\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ASC 606 accounting standards that require \u00e2\u0080\u009csufficient confidence\u00e2\u0080\u009d in future revenue.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Execution</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Push against these clauses very hard as it could impact your ability to recognize revenue. If a customer is insistent, PagerDuty\u2019s Bala recommends, \u00e2\u0080\u009creplacing it with a shorter contract term or no refund rights for pre-paid amounts.\u00e2\u0080\u009d</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>12. Right of First Refusal (ROFR)</h2>\n<p>If an interested party makes an offer to acquire your company, a Right of First Refusal (ROFR) clause allows a customer to acquire the company if they make the same offer. You should generally say no to these types of clauses because they can significantly impact the acquisition process.</p>\n<h3>Key Questions</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Does a customer have a right to match an offer made to acquire you?</li>\n<li>Can a customer block an acquisition of your company?</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Significance</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Customers might ask for this to reduce their exposure to an acquisition by a competitor.</li>\n<li>ROFRs can significantly complicate and delay the acquisition process.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Execution</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>The only time you should consider this clause is for a very strategic customer.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>13. Support Terms</h2>\n<p>Support terms define what your customer should expect from your support team and what happens if they don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t meet those expectations. These are similar in spirit to warranties and remedies, but rather than covering the product and its capabilities, they covers the promised support around your product.</p>\n<h3>Key Questions</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>How long should it take for a support ticket to be answered?</li>\n<li>How are support requests or problems escalated?</li>\n<li>What kind of remedies can a customer expect if support is not adequate?</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Significance</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Defining your support helps you clearly set expectations and avoid disappointment and potential demands for money back.</li>\n<li>Inadequate support can make it very hard for you to renew the contract.</li>\n<li>Customers may require the ability to terminate a contract for inadequate support. There may be implications for your ability to recognize revenue paid upfront if you agree to this.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Execution</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>As with warranties, be very clear in your definition of what is and is not covered by support.</li>\n<li>Remedies for failing to provide timely and sufficient support should typically be credits on the product. For instance, Salesforce sets the standard for service levels in SaaS and limits remedies to credits.</li>\n<li>Include disclaimers and specific measurements to prove a service level break to prevent customers taking advantage of this clause.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>14. Roll-out and Payment Milestones</h2>\n<p>Some sales contracts have clauses so that you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get paid unless you meet certain roll-out or milestone requirements. Unfortunately, rolling out new technology in an enterprise is tough. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s often legacy compatibility issues, user training, and a constant deluge of fires for IT to fight. Hinging payment on deployment is risky.</p>\n<h3>Key Questions</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Are there any conditions or milestones that you need to meet before your customer pays? If so, what are they? And what happens if you fail to meet them?</li>\n<li>Are there any milestones the customer has to achieve? What are the penalties if the customer does not meet them?</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Significance</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>This clause can disincentivize customers to effectively deploy and drive adoption of your product.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Execution</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Fight hard against milestone-based payments, but in some very risky large deals, these may be an unavoidable standard clause.</li>\n<li>If you do end up with milestone-based payments, add in reciprocal customer milestones and penalties to incentivize successful adoption of your product.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>15. Arbitration</h2>\n<p>Arbitration is a process by which parties that may have otherwise gone to court instead go to a third-party neutral judge who decides on the outcome. Arbitration clauses prevent both parties in a contract from filing a lawsuit and require that they use an alternative, such as a third-party neutral judge, to resolve certain disputes. These clauses are common (and controversial) in employment contracts. More recently, they have started to appear in sales contracts to reduce the financial risk in the event of a dispute.</p>\n<h3>Key Questions</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>If there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a disagreement between you and your customer, can the customer sue you in court or do they have to go to an arbiter?</li>\n<li>Under what conditions is arbitration used?</li>\n<li>Who chooses the arbiter and who pays for them?</li>\n<li>What is the arbitration process?</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Significance</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Arbitration can significantly reduce your and your customers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 legal exposure. Arbitration is much less random than a jury and arbiter-determined fines and awards are much smaller than jury-determined ones.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Execution</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Arbitration clauses are most advantageous when you have the most to lose in the relationship, such as when your customers are individuals or small businesses.</li>\n<li>If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re a bottom-up type company where you have hundreds of thousands of customers with individual users or small businesses, add an arbitration clause to your click-through contracts. It can shield you from a disaster if you have an issue impacting all those users.</li>\n<li>Beware of customers forcing arbitration clauses on you. It may be a red flag that they have a history of being a difficult customer.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>16. Pricing</h2>\n<p>Pricing is one of the most important contract clauses. Nothing impacts what type of business you build and its economics as much as pricing. Too often, my partners at a16z and I observe early-stage companies underprice their offerings. Pricing is also a deeper and longer topic than I can completely cover, so here I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll focus only on the contractual aspects of pricing \u2014 for a discussion of the full topic of pricing, check out the a16z <a href=\"https://a16z.com/2016/08/13/pricing/\">\u00e2\u0080\u009cPricing, Pricing, Pricing\u00e2\u0080\u009d podcast</a> and <a href=\"https://a16z.com/2014/05/19/saas-pricing-strategies/\">\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Price Is Right: And for Early-Stage SaaS Companies, It Needs to Be\u00e2\u0080\u009d article</a>.</p>\n<h3>Key Questions</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>What is your customer paying for and how much are they paying?</li>\n<li>What do you meter and how do you price per unit of consumption?</li>\n<li>Is there a threshold of consumption beyond which pricing changes (i.e. pricing tiers)?</li>\n<li>Is there a prepaid part and a \u00e2\u0080\u009ctrue-up\u00e2\u0080\u009d billed for the actual consumption? How is overconsumption priced?</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Significance</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Setting clear expectations for what a customer owes and how they will pay helps ensure timely payment and keep your finances in good order.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Execution</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Pricing goes hand in hand with packaging. You can sometimes use packaging to force a change in pricing. For instance, \u00e2\u0080\u009cBlue-washing,\u00e2\u0080\u009d a term used to describe how after someone acquires a company, they change the sales contracts (washing) through slight changes in packaging to have more favorable (blue) pricing terms.</li>\n<li>If you need to agree to a lower price, especially for early customers, make sure it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s written up as a discount rather than a lower price. This makes it easier to negotiate it back up.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Parting words</h2>\n<p>The sooner you can put together a standard contract and a strategy for negotiating with your customers, the better. As an early startup, you may have very little leverage in sales negotiations, but thinking through your contract clauses will help you get a strategic balance of risk and reward. This won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t just keep you in business, it will also set the stage for a successful exit strategy.</p>\n<p><em>Many thanks to the folks who have helped me to put this together: Sowmya Bala, Martin Casado, Mark Cranney, Patty Downey, Stacey Giamalis, John Gilman, Juleen Konkel, Peter Levine, Paul St. John, Sheena Weinberg, and Dan Wright.</em></p>\n<p>\u00e2\u0080\u0094</p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The views expressed here are those of the individual AH Capital Management, L.L.C.

We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve not only seen new companies and industries established, but also entirely new jobs and skills. Yet there are parts of the economy\u00e2\u0080\u0094particularly in technology and adjacent fields\u00e2\u0080\u0094where new forms of work constantly emerge, spread quickly, and just as quickly fade away. It is a flurry of change. This dynamism reflects the rise and fall of new computing platforms, communication tools, and technologies\u00e2\u0080\u0094whether that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009cHead of Influencer Marketing\u00e2\u0080\u009d or \u00e2\u0080\u009cGrowth Data Scientist\u00e2\u0080\u009d or \u00e2\u0080\u009cVR/AR Developer.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00c2\u00a0 Even jobs with the same title as a few decades ago, like \u00e2\u0080\u009cproduct manager,\u00e2\u0080\u009d are radically different today. Mastery of new programming languages, cloud computing infrastructure, and mobile platforms make them the same job in name only.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">This is life at the frontier: It requires self-reliance, lifelong learning, and community-building.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The old institutions are not enough. Traditional education\u00e2\u0080\u0094in the form of business schools, executive programs, and graduate programs\u00e2\u0080\u0094has been slow to meet the </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">practical, hands-on learning </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">needs of professionals at the forefront of change. If the pandemic has taught us anything about modern education, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s that it is in serious need of a reboot. In the future, students will engage and learn in <a href=\"https://a16z.com/2020/10/16/next-gen-edtech/\">new, more productive ways</a>.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In light of all this change, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m excited to announce that Andreessen Horowitz is leading the Series A for </span><a href=\"https://www.reforge.com/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Reforge</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, and that I\u2019</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">ll be joining the board. We\u2019re excited to formally work with <a href=\"https://a16z.com/author/brian-balfour/\">Brian Balfour</a>, Reforge\u00e2\u0080\u0099s CEO, on this ambitious new startup.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Reforge is reinventing education for professionals\u00e2\u0080\u0094particularly mid-career and senior level\u00e2\u0080\u0094working in frontier jobs. The company is beginning with the technology industry, focusing on content, community, and credentials. From the content side, the team has put together a dozen current and upcoming multi-week programs on the cutting edge of product management, marketing, and management. This in-depth, proprietary content was built from months of research and synthesis with leading CEOs and executives from magnetic companies like Pinterest, Yelp, Slack, Airtable, Uber, Spotify, Airbnb, Netflix, Zillow, and hundreds more. The programs are hands-on and actionable, so professionals in demanding and full-time roles can apply the lessons in real-time.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Reforge\u00e2\u0080\u0099s software platform is designed to enable cohort-based learning and a purely digital experience suitable for people around the world\u00e2\u0080\u0094future-proofed for the post-pandemic work environment. The business model is built on an annual membership that brings together a community of experienced operators. The quality of this community is further reinforced through strict vetting and ongoing criteria for membership, so the Reforge brand will represent cutting-edge expertise on someone\u00e2\u0080\u0099s resume or portfolio.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Brian Balfour is particularly suited for this ambitious mission. He grew up in Michigan, the child of two teachers. After a career as a repeat entrepreneur in venture capital funded startups, he took an executive role at HubSpot, where he was VP Growth. I first met him nearly a decade ago, when we both wrote about similar topics\u00e2\u0080\u0094<a href=\"https://a16z.com/2020/05/15/growth-in-turbulent-times/\">growing users, metrics, network effects</a>\u00e2\u0080\u0094on our personal blogs. I deeply respected his writing, which eschewed convenient \u00e2\u0080\u009ctips and tricks\u00e2\u0080\u009d and instead went deep on frameworks and systematic ways of thinking. It was a precursor to the content he\u00e2\u0080\u0099d later build. As Reforge took off, I became personally involved, working with Brian to launch the first program focused on my specialization\u00e2\u0080\u0094growing products by acquiring more users, engaging them more deeply, and retaining them over time. My colleague Anish also got involved early, enrolling in a program himself in the early years. Later, as an executive at Credit Karma, Anish referred many of the product managers on his team to Reforge.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Since the company launched in 2015, Brian and his team have been bootstrapping the program with impressive success. Reforge has carved out a wedge, becoming the leading training program for product and growth marketing at technology companies. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s beloved by alumni, whose ranks have grown to encompass many thousands, largely driven by word of mouth.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Today, Reforge is focused on a wedge into the heart of the Silicon Valley technology industry, particularly growth, marketing, and product. But its ambitions are much bigger: the company intends to comprehensively cover functions across technology disciplines. Eventually, Reforge may expand into a broader set of industries to serve cutting-edge companies throughout the world. This new round of Series A funding is meant to accelerate the team\u00e2\u0080\u0099s journey, and we are excited to partner with them along the way.</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\">***</p>\n<p><em>The views expressed here are those of the individual AH Capital Management, L.L.C.

In retrospect, there were two critical insights that would have significantly improved our ability to grow effectively. These are qualities we now look for when evaluating prospective investments at a16z.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">First, we lacked visibility into the \u00e2\u0080\u009ctransactional intent\u00e2\u0080\u009d of our customers. That is to say, we had no proprietary understanding </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">if</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> or </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">when</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> our customers might need a loan. Instead, we would spend money to acquire customers in the ether with the hopes that we could get in front of them in the narrow window when they were looking for financing. This reliance on third-party acquisition channels had a significant impact on our funnel and unit economics.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Second, we had no visibility into the \u00e2\u0080\u009capprovability\u00e2\u0080\u009d of our customers. Even when we were able to get in front of prospects at that transactional point of intent, we had no prior insight as to whether or not they would make it through our underwriting criteria. Instead, we would gather financial data at the point of application and were reliant on third-party data sources for this assessment (be it their self-reported financials in their accounting software, their bank transactional information, tax filings, and personal/business credit scores \u00e2\u0080\u0094 much of this being lagging indicators of their financial health). Often, a customer would look great at first blush and have a compelling use case for our loan, but then they would quickly be disqualified because of poor credit and/or financial history. Again, this had a significant impact on our funnel and unit economics.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">We believe that the best way to avoid these traps is by building a lending business that \u00e2\u0080\u009cleads with software\u00e2\u0080\u009d as opposed to a financial product. The goal with this approach is to build a product or platform that gives you unique visibility into both the transactional intent </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">and</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> approvability of your customers. The ability to \u00e2\u0080\u009cpush\u00e2\u0080\u009d a loan to the right customer at the right point in time as opposed to \u00e2\u0080\u009cpulling\u00e2\u0080\u009d your customer into your funnel (without these insights) can dramatically improve your unit economics, credit quality, and ability to scale.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen a number of creative approaches to this strategy. Many vertical software players that sit in the payments flow and have visibility into customer financials have executed against this thesis. Famously, Toast has evolved from a POS terminal to becoming a broader financial operating system for the restaurants they serve \u00e2\u0080\u0094 delivering inventory management, workflow tools, and payroll in addition to their core payments product. As a result of seeing both income and expenses, Toast has been able to identify merchants within their network that might qualify for working capital and extend financing at the right point in time (importantly, with a high degree of conversion given their visibility into \u00e2\u0080\u009ctransactional intent\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009capprovability\u00e2\u0080\u009d). In our portfolio, we recently announced an investment in a company called </span><a href=\"https://www.adaptive.build/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Adaptive</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, which is building vertical software for general contractors in the construction industry. Adaptive\u00e2\u0080\u0099s software will help contractors better manage and reconcile spend with their subcontractors. Because they have visibility into purchasing and payments flow within their network, they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be able to extend financing to qualified customers at those moments of transactional intent \u00e2\u0080\u0094 improving both their unit economics and credit quality versus a traditional lending approach.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re building with this thesis in mind \u00e2\u0080\u0094 we\u00e2\u0080\u0099d love to hear from you.

I used to become physically ill whenever there was something wrong in the company \u00e2\u0080\u0094 even if I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know what it was. Even if I couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t see it, I could feel it. It wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t a pleasant feeling. Most good founder/CEOs that I know have this same, gnarly experience. Unfortunately, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">feeling it</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> turns out to be the easy part of the job.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The hard part is what do you do when you feel that dread? Do you run towards your fear or do you run away from it?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Six months ago you hired a head of sales and you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve noticed that his understanding of some of the deals in the forecast is pretty thin. You\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve heard a couple of comments about him being an empty suit, but he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s made the number in his first two quarters. In your gut, you can feel the issues, but the last thing in the world you need to do right now is run another executive search. What do you do?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Your last round\u00e2\u0080\u0099s valuation was high and valuations have fallen. Your topline growth is a bit lower than expected and your spend rate is as planned. You can feel that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to be a big problem. Do you intellectualize it away? \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got a great new product release coming and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve gotten great press lately. We can make it up this quarter\u00e2\u0080\u009d or do you run towards the terrifying situation and try to figure it out now?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">When I was CEO of Loudcloud, we were growing so fast that the Fire Marshall called to warn us that he would shut down the company if we didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t find more space for all the people we had. I told my controller to find us some space right away, but it somehow didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t feel right. It felt like darkness. Somewhere in my body, I knew that the end of the dot-com boom was on the horizon, but I couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t logically articulate it, so I delegated the decision. I ran from the fear.\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">We signed a new lease for what would become known as \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Maude Building\u00e2\u0080\u009d because it was located on Maude Avenue around the corner from the original building on Mathilda Avenue. It gave us room to grow for the next several years. It required $30M in restricted cash.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The dot-com crash came, we lost nearly half of our customers, and we never moved into The Maude Building. The lease we signed was for $10 per square foot per month. When we tried to rent it out, we found that post dot-com crash, the market price was $0.90 per square foot per month. But given the number of companies that had gone out of business, there were no takers even at that price. I ran away from my fear and lost $30M. Thirty million dollars that I badly needed. Yet somehow, some way, we survived\u00e2\u0080\u0094and maybe we survived because I never ran away again. To this day, every time I feel fear, I run straight at it, and the scarier it is, the faster I run.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Which way you run is often the key differentiator between effective and ineffective CEOs. Almost all CEOs know where the problems are, but only the truly elite ones run towards the fear.</span></p>\n<p><em>On October 29th, Ben has a new book coming out,\u00c2\u00a0</em><a href=\"https://a16z.com/book/whatyoudo/\">What You Do is Who You Are</a><em>, which tries to answer a question crucial to every organization: how do you create and sustain the culture you want?</em>\u00c2\u00a0<em>Ben explains how to make your culture purposeful by examining four intriguing models of leadership and culture-building well outside the usual business case studies.\u00c2\u00a0<a href=\"https://a16z.com/book/whatyoudo/\">Go here to learn more and pre-order,</a>\u00c2\u00a0or you can find it online wherever books are sold.\u00c2\u00a0</em></p>\n", "author": "Ben Horowitz"}, "223": {"podcast": "a16z Podcast: Collectively Driving Change | Andreessen Horowitz", "url": "https://a16z.com/2019/05/27/laurene-powell-jobs-summit-2018/", "contents": "So in this episode of the a16z Podcast, Ben Horowitz interviews Powell Jobs on everything from what made her who she was, growing up in the working class rural hills of New Jersey, to how the Emerson...", "crawled": true, "body": "\n<div class=\"entry-content__primary\">\n<div class=\"entry-content__post-body wp-content\">\n<iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"200\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://player.simplecast.com/8adad6a7-a283-40e3-97c1-8989e1f314a9?dark=true\" title=\"a16z Podcast: Collectively Driving Change\" width=\"100%\"></iframe><ul class=\"bio-lp-subscribe__apps\" data-podcast-src=\"https://a16z.simplecast.com/episodes/a16z-podcast-collectively-driving-change-ghZ38i_u?dark=true\"></ul><script>window.distribImages = {};window.distribChannels = [];window.distribImages[\"Apple Podcasts\"] = \"https://a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/bio-lp_apple-podcasts.png\";window.distribChannels.push(\"Apple Podcasts\");window.distribImages[\"Spotify\"] = \"https://a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/bio-lp_spotify.png\";window.distribChannels.push(\"Spotify\");window.distribImages[\"Stitcher\"] = \"https://a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Stitcher@2x.png\";window.distribChannels.push(\"Stitcher\");</script>\n<p>Laurene Powell Jobs is, among many other things, founder and President of the Emerson Collective \u2014 the social impact firm she founded to drive change and reform through philanthropy, investing, and policy solutions.

But that technology extends far beyond shopping to ease friction throughout daily life. On a recent trip to China, I personally interacted with QR codes 42 times in a single day\u00e2\u0080\u0094to ride the train, to book a workout, to charge my phone, even to buy a round of drinks for a stranger\u00e2\u0080\u0099s birthday.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Companies in the US have been slow to adopt QR codes, but those who dismiss them as having \u00e2\u0080\u009cbeen around forever but never taken off\u00e2\u0080\u009d underestimate their wide-ranging potential. Camera-based solutions like QR codes (or facial recognition, for that matter) can make traditionally clunky user experiences seamless and intuitive. QR codes connect our online identity to the offline world, allowing users to essentially log in to physical locations\u00e2\u0080\u0094and bring their data with them. This delivers a number of benefits: brands learn user preferences, while customers gain a more tailored and social experience, as well as perks like automatic loyalty programs built into every transaction.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no coincidence that QR codes were popularized in China, where many consumers leapfrogged the PC and bought a smartphone as their first computer. As a result, many of China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s products are built first and foremost for </span><a href=\"https://a16z.com/2018/01/13/super-apps-china-product-innovation-wip/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">mobile</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, a fact that was readily apparent on my recent trip to China. This list highlights just some of the ways QR codes enable a whole new set of mobile-first experiences: improving offline social interactions, promoting easy health monitoring, streamlining operational efficiencies, and establishing innovative shopping channels. Here are 16 (<a href=\"https://a16z.com/2017/08/11/qr-codes-in-china/\">more!</a>) ways China is using QR codes.</span></p>\n<p><strong>1. Meet and flirt online at bars</strong><br/>\nWhen I returned to my favorite live music bar in Nanjing after two years away, the first thing I noticed was a screen behind the musician with a QR code. That screen is essentially an online portal for the bar: users can search for drinking buddies and publicly chat with fellow patrons about everything from the musician\u00e2\u0080\u0099s performance to current events. The company rolling out these screens, Vxiaocheng, only raised a pre-A round in 2018, but it already partners with <a href=\"https://36kr.com/p/5134294\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">over</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> 10,000 bars across more than 190 cities in China.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Entering the bar\u00e2\u0080\u0099s chat room is as simple as scanning a QR code on the top-right corner of the screen. Like </span><a href=\"https://a16z.com/2016/09/27/livestreaming-trend-china/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">livestreaming</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, users can earn avatar decorations and embellishments by being active users. But the system\u00e2\u0080\u0099s real appeal is the ability to interact directly with other patrons via phone. Before making moves in the physical world, people can see others\u00e2\u0080\u0099 user profiles, send private messages, and even give virtual gifts to break the ice.</span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/bar-qr-code.jpg?ssl=1\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-296095\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/bar-qr-code.jpg?resize=500%2C500&amp;ssl=1\" width=\"500\"/></a></p>\n<p><strong>2. Tip bar staff and musicians\u00c2\u00a0</strong><br/>\nA 2017 <a href=\"https://cj.sina.com.cn/article/detail/1980481147/230331\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">survey</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> found that 70 percent of Chinese netizens found carrying cash unnecessary. Since then, mobile payment adoption has continued to rise. Vxiaocheng\u2019s mobile system features an in-app button where attendees can tip the bar staff and live musicians; such online tips can </span><a href=\"https://36kr.com/p/5134294\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">double</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> a musician\u00e2\u0080\u0099s income. Because Vxiaocheng aggregates data on musicians over time, it has also become a valuable hiring platform for bar owners to browse more than 3,000 musicians.</span></p>\n<p><strong>3. Track your food from farm to grocer</strong><br/>\nWhen Alibaba rolled out its first Freshippo supermarkets in 2015, the company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s goal was to integrate <a href=\"https://a16z.com/2018/05/14/online-to-offline-china/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">online and offline</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> shopping. The company has effectively reimagined the supermarket experience, personalizing its app to customers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 shopping history and page views, offering a no-wait check-out experience, and providing free, 30-minute delivery within two miles of stores. Product signs in the produce, seafood, and meat departments, are equipped with QR codes that reveal distributor information, shipping logistics, and images of food safety certificates. Shoppers can also scan product barcodes In the Freshippo app to see reviews, nutrition facts, suggested pairings, even user-submitted recipes.

I highly recommend you read the full response and also recommend the book. Andy Rachleff (lecturer at Stanford, founder of Benchmark, and one of my board members for over 5 years) quoted from it often, and our company used it as the foundational model for thinking through our go-to-market strategy. We were such fans that we asked Moore to come and speak with the execs at VMware (our acquirer) in order to further dig into the ideas and implications as we brought our new product to market; that too was hugely useful and underlied our strategy in what is now a billion-dollar product line.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">So, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m a fan of Moore\u00e2\u0080\u0099s work and agree with much of his post. But the broader point I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m making, and would like to further emphasize in this post, is that the application of the crossing-the-chasm model isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t straightforward. From the perspective of a founder, the model doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t always play out as you\u00e2\u0080\u0099d expect; there is a lot of nuance to applying it in practice. And I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d argue those nuances are getting more pronounced given the faster pace of technology today and the secular trends I mention above.</span></p>\n<p>Below I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll focus on just the first two of the areas we covered in the previous posts, although similar arguments can be made throughout.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">First, let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s take the point about geographic expansion. I had originally stated that geographic expansion was yet another chasm. As Moore <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/reply-unending-chasm-how-survive-geoffrey-moore/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">reminds</a> us, the three dependencies for crossing the chasm are \u00e2\u0080\u009ca compelling use case that will create pull, a whole product that nails the use case, and a <em>word-of-mouth community that can communicate and reinforce the marketing message </em>[italics added].\u201d </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">He further adds that when you enter into a new geography, \u201cit is very hard to maintain this discipline, particularly if you are going through a product-oriented distribution channel\u201d.\u00c2\u00a0</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">So while it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s true that the model then holds here in theory, in practice, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s messy, and not just because it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hard to \u00e2\u0080\u009cmaintain the discipline\u00e2\u0080\u009d. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s because in applying the model, many founders make the inferential leap that a market exists with a word-of-mouth community if the other two conditions are met. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In our case, we knew that the NY financial sector spoke frequently with the UK financial sector, and since we had a lot of positive customer traction in the former geography, we chose to go internationally along this vertical precisely because we were trying to stay within a word-of-mouth community. However, we quickly found out that in the UK, the companies we were targeting had very different competitive environments, often had different technology and operational stacks, and relied on entirely different partner relationships. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Particularly relevant here is that much of the technology stack (and the surrounding ecosystem) were driven as much by organic, bottom-up adoption of open source technologies as much by top-down vendor sales, and were different enough from their NY counterparts that we couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t sell to them. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">While we ultimately figured it out, it took years, and by then we\u00e2\u0080\u0099d already tackled multiple other unrelated verticals. I</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">f I were to do it again, I would have first focused on expanding to those different verticals within the U.S. rather than trying to expand within a reference/ word-of-mouth community internationally. For us, the chasm across geographies was far wider than the power of word-of-mouth networks that could bridge that chasm. Now, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">this point may seem obvious to those who have done this before. But for a first-time founder like me it wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t, and unfortunately, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen this go similarly sideways with a number of other companies I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve observed over the years, too.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The other point I want to make in response to Moore\u00e2\u0080\u0099s argument about incumbents lack of desire to compete with startups: </span></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\"><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cLarge incumbents have neither the means nor the interest to block a chasm-crossing\u00c2\u00a0</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">play because they cannot operate at the small scale involved.\u00c2\u00a0$50M to $100M markets\u00c2\u00a0</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">are a godsend to a fledgling start-up, but they are a waste of time for a multi-billion-dollar\u00c2\u00a0</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">enterprise.\u00c2\u00a0What they can do is pre-empt a tornado market or, worst case, destroy it by\u00c2\u00a0</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">blocking access to the disruptors, but this ploy only works well in consumer markets.\u00c2\u00a0In\u00c2\u00a0</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">B2B markets, as long as the offer creates a genuine pull, your customer base can\u00c2\u00a0</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">pressure the incumbent to play ball.\u201d</span></em></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">I disagree. The enterprise landscape has evolved to the point where not only do incumbents bother to compete with pre-chasm products, they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re even more able to do so because of </span><b>cloud</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> and </span><b>open source</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. This is especially pronounced where incumbents own the technology distribution channel. Take for example AWS: They have full visibility on all the services that run on them; if they see a particular service gaining traction, they can easily offer the services themselves if the code is open source. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In fact, this has been such an issue that startups have taken on the potential fallout with their open source communities to change their licenses to disallow this open behavior. </span><a href=\"https://www.confluent.io/blog/license-changes-confluent-platform\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Confluent</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> and </span><a href=\"https://www.mongodb.com/press/mongodb-issues-new-server-side-public-license-for-mongodb-community-server\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">MongoDB</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> are just two recent examples; as Mongo co-founder and CTO Eliot Horowitz\u00c2\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.mongodb.com/press/mongodb-issues-new-server-side-public-license-for-mongodb-community-server\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">said</a>: \u201cUnfortunately, once an open source project becomes interesting, it is too easy for cloud vendors who have not developed the software to capture all of the value while contributing little back to the community.\u00e2\u0080\u009d </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">And often, open source projects are \u00e2\u0080\u009cinteresting\u00e2\u0080\u009d long before anyone figures out how to monetize them. The examples are many: In 2010 when Rackspace announced Openstack, it changed the entire landscape for cloud orchestration, causing many startups in the space to pivot or exit soon after. At the time, on-prem cloud offerings were still \u00e2\u0080\u009cpre-chasm\u00e2\u0080\u009d, and therefore a tough sell, yet it was a sensible move for Rackspace to gain relevancy and mindshare. Google later changed the landscape again with Kubernetes and Istio, which have shaken up cloud orchestration and L7 services within the datacenter.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In every one of these instances startups in the space are having to contend with moves by an incumbent. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Furthermore, the observation that \u00e2\u0080\u009c</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">What [the incumbents] can do is pre-empt a tornado market, or worse case, destroy it by blocking access to the disruptors, but this </span></i><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">ploy only works well in consumer markets</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u00e2\u0080\u009d is no longer true.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> With the organic nature of bottom-up and </span><b>developer-led adoption</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, enterprise companies are starting to see more and more </span><a href=\"https://a16z.com/2018/08/25/growth-saas-enterprise-bottomsup/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">consumer-style growth</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> curves. As such, we see incumbents release open source or free services to pre-empt a market (or destroy it before it can flourish). </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">I think the incumbents have learned the lessons from the history of disruption and now realize that even a non-revenue-generating developer phenomenon can still be a huge existential threat. (It certainly was the case when I ran a business unit of an incumbent.)\u00c2\u00a0</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">This isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t to say companies can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t navigate these situations; they can! I just wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t base my strategy on the assumption that the incumbents will not and cannot respond. They can and they do.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">I want to thank Geoffrey again for this respectful exchange; I remain a huge fan of his and of the model. But for those companies that are struggling in the chasm and finding it to be less neat than they (or their boards) expect, I hope this back-and-forth offers some solace, if not some guidance, in the even messier world we live in today.</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The views expressed here are those of the individual AH Capital Management, L.L.C.

Logically, determining whether selling a company will be better in the long term than continuing to run it stand-alone involves a huge number of factors, most of which are speculative or unknown. And if you are the founder, the logical part is the easy part.</p>\n<p>Indeed, the task would be far simpler if there were no emotion involved. But selling your company is always emotional and deeply personal.</p>\n<h2>Types of Acquisitions</h2>\n<p>For the purpose of this discussion, it is useful to think about technology acquisitions in 3 categories:</p>\n<p><strong>1. Talent and/or Technology\u00e2\u0080\u0094</strong>when a company is acquired purely for its technology and or its people. These kinds of deals typically range between $5 and $50M.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Product\u00e2\u0080\u0094</strong>when a company is acquired for its product, but not its business. The acquirer plans to sell the product roughly as it is, but will do so primarily with its own sales and marketing capability. These kinds of deals typically range between $25M and $250M.</p>\n<p><strong>3.</strong>\u00c2\u00a0<strong>Business\u00e2\u0080\u0094</strong>when a company is acquired for its actual business (revenue and earnings). The acquirer values the entire operation (product, sales, and marketing) not just the people, technology, or products. These deals are typically valued (at least in part) by their financial metrics and can be extremely large (e.g. Microsoft\u00e2\u0080\u0099s $30B+ offer for Yahoo!).</p>\n<p>This post is most applicable to\u00c2\u00a0<em>business</em>\u00c2\u00a0acquisitions with some relevance to\u00c2\u00a0<em>product</em>\u00c2\u00a0acquisitions and will be fairly useless if you are selling people and/or technology.</p>\n<h2>The Logical</h2>\n<p>When analyzing whether or not you should sell your company, a good basic rule of thumb is:</p>\n<p>If\u2026</p>\n<p>a) You are very early on in a very large market</p>\n<p>AND</p>\n<p>b) You have a good chance of being number 1 in that market</p>\n<p>\u2026then you should remain stand-alone. The reason is that nobody will be able to afford to pay what you are worth, because nobody can give you that much forward credit. For an easy to understand example, consider Google. When they were very early, they reportedly received multiple acquisition offers for more than $1B. These were considered very rich offers at the time and they were being offered a gigantic multiple. However, given the size of the ultimate market, it did not make sense for Google to sell. In fact, it didn\u2019t make sense for Google to sell to any suitor at any price that the buyer could have paid. Why? Because the market that Google was pursuing was actually bigger than the markets that all of the potential buyers owned and Google had built a nearly invincible product lead which enabled them to be number 1.</p>\n<p>Contrast this situation with Pointcast. Pointcast was one of the first Internet applications to catch fire. They were the buzz of Silicon Valley and the technology industry in general. They received billion dollar acquisition offers that they passed on. Then, due to flaws in their product architecture, their customers started to turn off their application. Overnight, their market collapsed and never returned. They were ultimately sold for a relatively tiny amount.</p>\n<p>So, the judgment that you have to make is a) is this market really much bigger (more than an order of magnitude) than has been exploited to date? b) Are we going to be number 1? If the answer to either a) or b) is no, then you should consider selling. If the answers to both are yes, then selling would literally mean selling yourself and your employees short.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, these questions are not as simple to answer as I\u2019ve made them out to be. In order to get the answer right, you also have to answer the question: \u201cwhat is the market really and who are the competitors going to be?\u201d Was Google in the search market or the portal market? Clearly, in retrospect, they were in the search market. Most people thought they were in the portal market at the time. Yahoo was a tough competitor in the portal market, but not so much in the search market. If Google had really been in the portal market, then selling might have been a good idea. Pointcast thought that their market was much larger than it turned out to be. Interestingly, Pointcast\u2019s own product execution (or lack thereof) caused their market to shrink.</p>\n<p>Let\u2019s look at the case of Opsware. Why did I sell Opsware? Another good question is why didn\u2019t I sell Opsware until I did?</p>\n<p>At Opsware, we started in the Server Automation market. When we received our first inquiries/offers for the Server Automation company, we had less than 50 customers. I believed that there were at least 10,000 target customers and that we had a decent shot at being number 1. In addition, although I knew the market would be redefined, I thought that we could expand to networks and storage (Data Center Automation) faster than the competition and win that market as well. Therefore, assuming 30% market share, somebody would have had to pay 60X what we were worth in forward credit to buy out our potential. You won\u2019t be surprised to find that nobody was willing to pay that.</p>\n<p>Once we grew to several hundred customers and expanded into Data Center\u00c2\u00a0Automation, we were still number 1 and were more valuable stand-alone than any of the prior acquisition offers. At that point both Opsware and our main competitor Bladelogic had developed into full-fledged companies (world-wide sales forces, built out professional services, etc). This was significant, because it meant that a large company could buy one of us and potentially execute successfully (big enterprise companies can\u2019t generally succeed with small acquisitions, because too much of the important intellectual property is the sales methodology and big companies can\u2019t build that).</p>\n<p>At this point, it became clear that BMC was going to buy either Opsware or Bladelogic. As a result, the calculus, or whether Opsware was going to be number 1 in the market, needed to be redefined as follows:</p>\n<p>1. We had to be number 1 in the Systems &amp; Network Management market rather than the Data Center Automation market, because like the word processor market, the Data Center Automation market was going to be subsumed by a larger market that contained it.</p>\n<p>2. In order to be number 1, we had to beat BMC+Bladelogic which was a significantly more difficult opponent than either company stand-alone.</p>\n<p>Finally, the market itself was transforming due to an underlying technological shift: virtualization. Virtualization meant that the entire market needed to be re-tooled, so we were embarking on a new R&amp;D race to build the best management for virtualized environments. This meant deferring earnings for a very long time.</p>\n<p>Based on all of these factors, it made sense for us to at least consider the possibility of acquisition and run a short process to understand the interest in the M&amp;A market. Through that process, 11 companies made acquisition offers of some form. This told me that we were at a local maxima in terms of the market price for Opsware. I.e., the set of potential buyers was convinced that the market was very important and there was no extra premium that we could hope to achieve through better awareness. In the end, based on a lot of analysis and soul searching, I determined that the current local maxima was higher than we could expect to achieve in the next 3-5 years and I sold the company to Hewlett Packard for $1.65B. I think and hope that was the right decision.</p>\n<h2>The Emotional</h2>\n<p>The funny thing about the emotional part of the decision is that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s so schizophrenic.</p>\n<p>How can you ever sell your company after you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve personally recruited every employee and sold them on your spectacular vision of a thriving, stand-alone business? How can you ever sell out your dream?</p>\n<p>How can you walk away from total financial independence for yourself and every member of your close and distant family? Aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you in business to make money? How much money does one person need?</p>\n<p>How can you reconcile\u00c2\u00a0<em>Dr. Stay-the-Course</em>\u00c2\u00a0and\u00c2\u00a0<em>Mr. Sell-the-Thing?</em>\u00c2\u00a0Clearly they are irreconcilable, but the key is to mute them both.</p>\n<p>A few keys on muting the emotions:</p>\n<p><strong>Get paid (a salary)\u00e2\u0080\u0094</strong>Most venture capitalists like entrepreneurs that are \u00e2\u0080\u009call in\u00e2\u0080\u009d, meaning that the entrepreneur has everything invested in the company and will have very little to show for her efforts if the company does not succeed.\u00c2\u00a0 As part of this, they prefer that the founding CEO have a very low salary. In general, this is a good idea, because the temptation to walk away when things go poorly is intense and total financial commitment helps one keep his other commitments. However, once the company starts to become a company rather than an idea then it makes sense to pay the CEO at market. More specifically, once the company has a business (as defined above) and becomes an attractive acquisition target, it makes sense to pay the CEO, so that the decision to keep or sell the company isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t a direct response to the CEO\u00e2\u0080\u0099s personal financial situation as in: \u00e2\u0080\u009cI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think that we should sell the company, but I live in an 850 square foot apartment with my husband and two kids and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s that or divorce.\u00e2\u0080\u009d</p>\n<p><strong>Be clear with the company\u00e2\u0080\u0094</strong>One question that every start-up CEO gets from her employees is: \u00e2\u0080\u009care you selling the company?\u00e2\u0080\u009d This is an incredibly difficult question. If she says nothing, the employee will likely interpret this to mean the company is for sale. If she says \u00e2\u0080\u009cat the right price,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the employee will wonder what that price is and may even ask. If the company ever reaches that price, the employee will assume the company will be sold. If she dodges the question with the standard \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe company is not for sale,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the employee may feel betrayed if the company is ever sold. More importantly, the CEO may feel like she is betraying the employee and that feeling will influence her decision making process. One way to avoid these traps is to describe the analysis in the prior section: if the company achieves product/market fit in a very large market and has an excellent chance to be number 1, then the company will likely remain independent. If not, it will likely be sold. This is one good method to describe the interests of the investors in a way that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not at odds with the interests of the employees and is true.</p>\n<h2>Final Thought</h2>\n<p>When faced with the decision of whether or not to sell your company, there is no easy answer.

It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s very possible that China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s latest trend in mobile self expression and entertainment,\u00c2\u00a0livestreaming, is next.</p>\n<p>Livestreaming has been around in the U.S. for years but hasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really taken off at mainstream scale yet. There are plenty of mobile apps around the world for it, from Facebook Live to Flipagram, Inke, Instagram Stories, Live.me, Meerkat, Momo, Snapchat, Twitch, Twitter Periscope, YouNow, YY, and so on. Yet as with previous new forms of mobile self expression, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s taking off in China in particular: For instance, roughly 46% of China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s internet population used a livestreaming app <a href=\"http://europe.chinadaily.com.cn/business/2016-08/04/content_26346673.htm\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">in June 2016</a>. Huachuang Securities <a href=\"http://adage.com/article/digital/advertisers-tapping-china-s-crazy-livestreaming-culture/305599/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">estimated</a> the mobile livestreaming market opportunity to be a $1.8B industry last year, expanding to $15.9B by 2020. Credit Suisse stated in its September research report that it believes the Chinese <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/credit-suisse-note-on-chinese-livestreaming-industry-2016-9\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">personal livestreaming</a> market will be $5B next year \u2014 already just\u00c2\u00a0$2B less than China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s movie box office total ($7B) and half the size of its mobile gaming market.</p>\n<p>These are startling figures given that the livestreaming explosion in China really only started a year ago. When Chinese entrepreneurs saw Meerkat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s explosive growth in March 2015, they sought to create livestreaming apps of their own; since then, over 150 live streaming apps have been launched in China. The phenomenon is still quite young, but what do we know so far about livestreaming in China \u2014 and what can we hopefully learn as it evolves both there\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 and here?</p>\n<h5>#1 It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a new form of entertainment</h5>\n<p>Although the livestreaming category had been around in China and the U.S. for over a decade, some Chinese apps (such as Inke) reframed it as social livestreaming \u2014 essentially video chatrooms where strangers gather to watch and chat with a broadcaster. This new content category helped push spontaneous livestreaming as the next evolution in self-expression, beyond selfies, stickers, and filters.</p>\n<p>Previously, livestreaming platforms in China and the U.S. were mostly known for gaming (Twitch for example is\u00c2\u00a0live-gamestreaming) or\u00c2\u00a0pre-planned live performances for singing and dancing. Inke and other social streaming apps not only shifted the focus from the webcam to the mobile camera, but from the camera on the back of the phone <em>to the camera on the front of the phone</em>. In other words: from outward capture \u2014 what you are seeing or where you are \u2014 to inward capture, a.k.a. your face. To understand the significance, imagine Snapchat stories without the inward capture: It would feel more like documenting news than expressing oneself.</p>\n<p>Livestreaming in China is thus more like a video version of selfies. And the interaction \u2014 between personal broadcasters/hosts and their audiences \u2014 is the fulcrum for engagement and monetization.</p>\n<h5>#2 Interaction replaces the need for \u00e2\u0080\u009ctalent\u00e2\u0080\u009d</h5>\n<p>If one thinks of livestreaming in China as the mobile-native version of television, then <em>social livestreaming</em> is part reality TV, part late-night talk show. But what is so entertaining about watching everyday people stream their daily lives \u2014 laying on the couch watching TV, eating meals, driving to work, or more often than not, sitting at their desks in their bedrooms? This isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t exactly the Truman Show!</p>\n<p>The answer lies in the interaction between broadcasters and viewers, all enabled by the platform. If a viewer likes a broadcast, he or she can send a public question, a digital gift, or multiple digital gifts to grab the broadcaster\u2019s attention. The broadcaster can then choose to acknowledge the sender\u00e2\u0080\u0099s username and respond with a quick answer or a simple thank you. For example, let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s say you send a broadcaster a digital sticker of a sports car (a luxury sticker, usually costing over $30 apiece) and then immediately afterwards ask him or her to sing your favorite song. If the broadcaster feels up for it, he or she will thank you for the gift and honor your request \u2014 all in the public chatroom that other viewers are also watching from.</p>\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-16250\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" id=\"attachment_16250\" style=\"width: 553px\"><img alt=\"On Inke, a viewer just gifted this broadcaster a sports car costing $45 (of which the broadcaster will likely keep ~$15). \" class=\"size-full wp-image-16250\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"427\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/inke-gift_conniea16z.png?resize=553%2C427&amp;ssl=1\" width=\"553\"/><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-16250\"><em>On Inke, a viewer just gifted this broadcaster a sports car sticker that cost $45 (of which the broadcaster will likely keep ~$15).</em></figcaption></figure>\n<p>This interaction gives the sender the joy of recognition and instant gratification, gives the broadcaster financial payoffs from the digital sticker, and gives the other viewers in the room entertaining content. Viewers can thus help dictate much of the show\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009cdirection\u00e2\u0080\u009d.</p>\n<p>Another gamification feature in\u00c2\u00a0successful livestreaming apps is the <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/users/2015/12/younow_a_live_streaming_social_network_is_making_stars.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">use of leaderboards</a> to surface unknown vs. incumbent stars (which are difficult to topple on platforms like YouTube). Everything is designed around surfacing new streamers, livestreams, and trending personalities. Applied to individual broadcasters, leaderboards also highlight their top fans based on the total values of digital gifts sent. This competition among top fans for broadcasters then\u00c2\u00a0increases\u00c2\u00a0interaction and gifting.</p>\n<p>With such a\u00c2\u00a0focus on viewer <em>interaction</em>, broadcasters rarely need to pre-plan much of their content. They just need to open the app and engage with their audience. In the past, top broadcasters had to be talented\u00c2\u00a0in gaming, music, dancing, or some kind of performance. Now, a top broadcaster might not have any traditional talents. In this way, putting a \u00e2\u0080\u009csocial\u00e2\u0080\u009d in front of livestreaming expanded the supply of potential broadcasters in China.</p>\n<h5>#3 Digital gifting aligns incentives</h5>\n<p>Why do broadcasters choose to livestream in the first place? The reasons are simple: To feel famous, pass time, make money, and meet people.</p>\n<p>When a viewer buys a digital gift for a broadcaster, the revenue is split between the app store, the broadcaster, and the livestreaming platform. Gifts can range anywhere between a few cents to several hundred U.S. dollars. The top broadcasters in China make tens of thousands of dollars a month \u2014 it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not uncommon to hear stories where someone has quit his or her full time job to pursue broadcasting because it pays <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/chinas-internet-stream-queens-are-being-showered-with-cash-1474970694\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">so much more</a>.</p>\n<p>Through digital gifting, broadcasters receive instant feedback that they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re loved by their fans; viewers receive acknowledgement from broadcasters they like; and platforms earn\u00c2\u00a0money. And because broadcasters see livestreaming as a way to make money, too, they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re incented to broadcast more frequently. As a result, China livestreaming apps have a steady supply of content \u2014 an issue that <a href=\"http://www.recode.net/2016/3/4/11586696/meerkat-is-ditching-the-livestream-and-chasing-a-video-social-network\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">other</a> livestreaming apps in the U.S. hadn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t overcome.</p>\n<p>Another dynamic to note is that most of China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s social livestreaming apps focus on stranger-to-stranger networks where <a href=\"https://a16z.com/2016/07/24/money-as-message/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">digital gifting as a form of communication</a>\u00c2\u00a0is more culturally familiar and common. These platforms would have different gifting dynamics if the streams were from friends to existing friends.</p>\n<h5>#4 Advertising isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t the only way to monetize</h5>\n<p>Because incentives between platform, broadcaster, and viewers are aligned through messaging and a culture of digital gifting, Chinese livestreaming platforms generate revenue right out the gate. And they do so without relying on advertising revenue or big brand campaigns.</p>\n<p>In popular livestreaming app YY\u00e2\u0080\u0099s case, for example, advertising is a very small source of revenue: Online advertising accounted for 9.0%, 4.0%, and 1.1% of YY\u00e2\u0080\u0099s total net revenues in <a href=\"http://apps.shareholder.com/sec/viewerContent.aspx?companyid=AMDA-NICNI&amp;docid=11342357\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">2013</a>, 2014, and 2015, respectively.</p>\n<p>This is not to say that brands aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t interested in the livestreaming platforms. It just means that these apps have found other ways to monetize traffic.</p>\n<h5>#5 But of course brands are experimenting with livestreaming</h5>\n<p>Global brands are already paying attention to livestreaming platforms as new channels of promoting product.</p>\n<p>Macy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s livestreamed a tour of its Manhattan store on 34<sup>th</sup> Street, a more obvious \u201csee what I see\u201d livestreaming behavior. Oreo, meanwhile, took advantage of the livestreaming entertainment angle by running a <a href=\"http://adage.com/article/digital/advertisers-tapping-china-s-crazy-livestreaming-culture/305599/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">campaign</a> where a popular singer shoved Oreo cookies into his mouth while singing the list of ingredients.\u00c2\u00a0Xiaomi found a creative, and somewhat meta, way to use livestreaming: To show off the impressive battery life of its Mi Max phablet, it just ran a continuous stream until the battery gave out. Both stream and battery lasted 19 hours. More notably, over 39 million people watched at some point!</p>\n<p>Other ways brands could work with livestreaming platforms/apps and broadcasters include providing branded digital gifts, which would work like\u00c2\u00a0product placement in traditional programming.</p>\n<h5><strong>#6 Video is a great way to sell things, naturally!</strong></h5>\n<p>Ecommerce companies are also adapting quickly to people\u00e2\u0080\u0099s evident demand for livestreaming. For example, Beijing-based JD.com, which ships fresh produce as JD Fresh, broadcasted a lobster-cooking competition on livestreaming app Douyu during a national holiday. Five million viewers watched the broadcast and JD Fresh saw a significant increase in its <a href=\"https://a16z.com/2015/08/21/16-metrics/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">GMV</a> during that 12-day period.</p>\n<p>Another example is Alibaba\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Taobao (the <a href=\"https://a16z.com/2016/02/16/mindsets-for-thinking-about-innovation-in-and-competition-from-china/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">so-called</a> \u00e2\u0080\u009ceBay of China\u00e2\u0080\u009d), which launched a separate app, Taobao Live, where viewers can watch live broadcasts of sellers describing their merchandise. Content streamed so far includes product reviews, new product launches, and limited-time discounts. But beyond the sales they make, these broadcasters, too, can receive virtual gifts for their livestreams.</p>\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-16251\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" id=\"attachment_16251\" style=\"width: 517px\"><img alt=\"On Taobao Live, ecommerce sellers are expanding their marketing efforts through livestreaming. \" class=\"size-full wp-image-16251\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"401\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/taobaolive-stream_conniea16z.png?resize=517%2C401&amp;ssl=1\" width=\"517\"/><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-16251\"><em>On Taobao Live, ecommerce sellers are expanding their marketing efforts through livestreaming.</em></figcaption></figure>\n<p>Even big-name sellers are getting in on the livestreaming action: Lei Jun, the founder and CEO of Xiaomi, used their app Xiaomi Live to directly launch the Xiaomi Drone to over a million viewers.</p>\n<h5>#7 Who is livestreaming?</h5>\n<p>According to a survey of 1500 livestreaming hosts conducted by Today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Internet Celebrity [and <a href=\"https://www.credit-suisse.com/us/en.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">reported</a> by Credit Suisse, September 2016], a little more than two-thirds are under the age of 26 and about half are at least college-educated. The most common use case for these users was chatting on the livestreaming platforms.</p>\n<p>In general, the demographics of Chinese livestreaming app users are skewed in both gender and location.</p>\n<p>Females make up ~80% of <a href=\"http://www.gamersky.com/news/201512/698755.shtml\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">broadcasters</a>, but only ~20% of the overall app <a href=\"http://www.questmobile.com.cn/blog/blog_41.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">users</a>,\u00c2\u00a0so\u00c2\u00a0the audience for a majority of broadcasts is mostly male. This demographic is suited to digital gifting, since the\u00c2\u00a0gifts are an easy\u00c2\u00a0way to flirt \u2014 the digital version of \u00e2\u0080\u009clet me by you a drink\u00e2\u0080\u009d. As signals of flattery or admiration, recipients aren\u2019t usually offended by them. And\u00c2\u00a0abuse prevention is managed through platform tools that allow the broadcaster and his/her top fans to permanently block misbehaving users.</p>\n<p>It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also worth noting that while revenue concentration hasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t been disclosed by the platforms, some <a href=\"http://36kr.com/p/5048953.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">reports</a> believe that 5% of viewers contribute 70% of virtual gift revenue. That doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t necessarily mean that only a small percentage of viewers send digital gifts; some of the gifters are very generous, spending thousands of dollars on these apps.</p>\n<p>Geographically, only 11% of viewers are estimated [by Talking Data] to be in Tier 1 cities \u2014 34% are in Tier 2 cities, and 55% live in Tier 3 cities. This suggests that for many viewers, livestreaming is a window to a world not otherwise accessible to them \u2026 and that digital gifts are a way to \u00e2\u0080\u009cbuy access\u00e2\u0080\u009d to an interaction that they\u00c2\u00a0wouldn\u2019t be likely to have \u201c<a href=\"http://thenewinquiry.com/essays/the-irl-fetish/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">in real life</a>\u201c.</p>\n<h5>#8 From \u2018internet famous\u2019 to \u2018livestream famous\u2019</h5>\n<p>Just as YouTube surfaced a brand new category of web influencers, livestreaming is also creating a new type of celebrity. The third-party livestreaming ecosystem is still forming, but we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re already seeing the emergence of talent agencies that exclusively manage Chinese broadcasters and negotiate revenue splits with the platforms.</p>\n<p>Many livestreaming apps are still figuring out how to produce and monetize their <em>own</em> professional user-generated content. For example, YY created an 18-member pop girl band called <a href=\"http://investors.yy.com/1504/291897004643.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">1931</a>\u00c2\u00a0based on auditions from 40,000 contestants in China a couple years ago.</p>\n<p>And finally, some livestreaming celebrities have tried to make the jump from amateur talent to broadcast television or movies \u2014 but not many have succeeded. One possible reason for this is that the image resolution for movies and television is much higher than that of mobile phones, and many of these web celebrities don\u2019t look the same on the big screen!</p>\n<h5>#9 Livestreaming gives rise to (or is enabled by) a new set of beautification tools</h5>\n<p>Besides obvious factors like connectivity, bandwidth, and smartphone penetration, another technology enabling livestreaming is\u00c2\u00a0a new set of tools that make it easier for livestreamers to look and sound good \u2014 automatically.</p>\n<p>Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have time to do make up? No problem \u2014 there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an app for that! (Many apps, in fact).\u00c2\u00a0Various livestreaming providers in China have built such broadcaster tools into their platforms; Inke, for example, has a built-in \u00e2\u0080\u009cbeautycam\u00e2\u0080\u009d feature that automatically smooths skin and makes all types of blemishes disappear. (Since we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re extending the metaphor of livestreaming-as-video selfies here, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s worth noting that there are numerous Chinese makeup and beautification apps that do this for selfies as well).<img alt=\"inke-soundtool_conniea16z\" class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-16252\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"376\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/inke-soundtool_conniea16z.png?resize=245%2C376&amp;ssl=1\" width=\"245\"/></p>\n<p>Meanwhile, for audio quality, Inke also offers a sound equalizer where the broadcaster can tune his or her voice and pitch.</p>\n<p>These tools encourage broadcasters to stream often without much planning, ultimately increasing the amount of available content to end users and continually lowering the barriers to entry for \u00e2\u0080\u009cnon-produced\u00e2\u0080\u009d (vs. established celebrity) broadcasters. It remains to be seen which group of broadcasters will stick around for the long term, however.</p>\n<h5>#10 There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a tension between production and lack of production</h5>\n<p>The tension between production and <em>lack of</em> production is an especially interesting one to watch when it comes to Chinese livestreaming apps and the evolution of its talent ecosystem.</p>\n<p>While the tools described above enable anyone to livestream in a produced-without-being-too-produced way, many popular livestreamers have constructed more highly produced \u00e2\u0080\u009csets\u00e2\u0080\u009d dedicated for livestreaming in their bedrooms:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"homebroadcast-set_conniea16z\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-16253\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"408\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"(max-width: 721px) 100vw, 721px\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/homebroadcast-set_conniea16z.png?resize=721%2C408&amp;ssl=1\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/homebroadcast-set_conniea16z.png?w=721&amp;ssl=1 721w, https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/homebroadcast-set_conniea16z.png?resize=300%2C170&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/homebroadcast-set_conniea16z.png?resize=125%2C71&amp;ssl=1 125w, https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/homebroadcast-set_conniea16z.png?resize=583%2C330&amp;ssl=1 583w\" width=\"721\"/></p>\n<p>When it comes to the tension between produced and non-produced, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s some interesting inversions playing out for more established internet-famous celebrities. Popular web-video celebrity Papi Jiang <a href=\"https://www.credit-suisse.com/us/en.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">apparently</a> lost a number of fans after livestreaming a clip that the audience viewed as less funny than her usual more produced web video bits.</p>\n<p>As for traditional celebrities, time will tell. So far a top Chinese entertainment show, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m a Singer\u00e2\u0080\u009d live <a href=\"http://cnews.chinadaily.com.cn/2016-04/15/content_24572965.htm\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">broadcasted</a> an episode on Inke, and 10 million users tuned in. The popular South Korean boy band Big Bang also livestreamed its concert to 8 million viewers there.\u00c2\u00a0There are some concerns however that livestreaming such public events could affect gifting behaviors and monetization, or trigger different regulation protocols. And coming full circle to the point I opened with, none of these concert-style livestreams are really forms of personal self-expression \u2014 it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s using the outward-facing vs. <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/users/2015/12/younow_a_live_streaming_social_network_is_making_stars.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">inward-facing</a> camera.</p>\n<h5>#11 Feature or product?</h5>\n<p>An open question is whether livestreaming will succeed as a standalone product/platform or whether it will be a feature added onto other apps.</p>\n<p>As the category began to grow in China last year, some apps decided to add livestreaming functionality to their existing offerings. One example is Momo, a social dating/flirting app for meeting strangers. Since <a href=\"http://tech.qq.com/a/20160517/079323.htm\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">adding</a> livestreaming later in 2015, Momo saw it contribute $15.6M in revenue in Q1 2016 \u2014 becoming the company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s largest revenue stream within just three quarters.</p>\n<p>But it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not just a siloed feature; livestreaming allows users to more easily find out if someone\u00e2\u0080\u0099s profile photo was overly photo-shopped, in this way extending the social interaction to a form of social proof. Livestreaming also increased engagement in other ways; for example, recipients of digital gifts on Momo viewed them as signals of sincerity, which helps make the platform more effective at matchmaking.</p>\n<h5>#12 Vertical or standalone?</h5>\n<p>On a similar note, livestreaming in China could expand to new verticals altogether.\u00c2\u00a0In describing the evolution of livestreaming from 1.0 (PC showrooming) to 2.0 (game streaming) to 3.0 (the current generation \u2013 mobile entertainment streaming), Credit Suisse analysts Zoe Zhao, Evan Zhou, and Angela Zhou argue that generation 4.0 will be about vertical integration. Besides ecommerce as described above, this could include education, other knowledge/skill sharing, and news media.</p>\n<p>While I agree that this is possible and likely, I believe mobile entertainment streaming will still remain popular. It also should monetize the best, since digital gifting in this context is a form of <em>communication</em>. Social livestreaming is a form of self-expression and interaction, and that gets lost in combination with other apps where the focus is more on utility or information.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, the impact of digital gifting changes when livestreaming is applied to other verticals. Tipping a teacher or a news reporter has a very different appeal than tipping a broadcaster who is\u00c2\u00a0playing a game of online truth-or-dare with his or her viewers.\u00c2\u00a0And finally, watching social livestreaming is an activity that requires little mental effort or planning for viewers and even for broadcasters. The same can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be said of watching a livestream of an academic lecture, for example.</p>\n<h5>#13 It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a fragmented space</h5>\n<p>With over 150 live streaming apps in China, the market is fragmented and not yet winner-take-all.\u00c2\u00a0While many Chinese internet players and VCs have poured millions of dollars into this space, there aren\u2019t signs of strong\u00c2\u00a0<a href=\"https://a16z.com/tag/all-about-network-effects/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">network effects</a> where the winner will have a clear and defensible moat against competitors.</p>\n<p>While the services do become more valuable as more users join, broadcasters are not always loyal to one app. They\u2019ll switch if another app offers more viewers, better tools, or higher payouts.\u00c2\u00a0In future, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s possible that the space\u00c2\u00a0will consolidate as platforms begin to fight for talent, lower their take rates from digital gift revenue for broadcasters, or invest in professional user-generated content.</p>\n<p>Or perhaps many livestreaming apps will co-exist together \u2014 just like television, which isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t dominated by a single TV channel. I believe more than one player will be left standing in this space.</p>\n<h5>#14 It\u2019ll be a regulated space</h5>\n<p>As with\u00c2\u00a0television and online video, livestreaming in China will be a regulated space. It\u2019s already against the law to livestream pornography or similarly inappropriate content.</p>\n<p>China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Ministry of Culture <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-37127904\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">announced</a> just a few months ago that it was investigating a number of livestreaming platforms for hosting content that \u00e2\u0080\u009charms social morality\u00e2\u0080\u009d. Not surprisingly, some broadcasters tried finding workarounds, and eventually livestreaming platforms had to ban such behaviors, like\u00c2\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-news-from-elsewhere-36226141\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">seductively eating bananas</a>.</p>\n<p>Most livestreaming apps in China employ teams of hundreds or thousands of people to monitor content on their platforms. This includes making sure that inappropriate content is flagged and not accessible, and can even\u00c2\u00a0extend to flagging boring content, effectively manually curating which broadcasts are featured and easiest to discover.</p>\n<p>As the Chinese government wraps its head around the livestreaming phenomenon, there may be new clarifications regarding internal processes for platforms and required licenses for platforms and broadcasters.</p>\n<h5>#15 Chinese companies trying to go global</h5>\n<p>Although the livestreaming phenomenon I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve described here has to date been concentrated in China, some companies are betting that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s about to change.</p>\n<p>YY for example, owns a large stake in Bigo Live, which is taking on the Southeast Asian market.\u00c2\u00a0Cheetah Mobile, which I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve <a href=\"https://a16z.com/2016/02/16/mindsets-for-thinking-about-innovation-in-and-competition-from-china/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">noted before</a> is one of the more savvy companies in China at expanding to international markets, is bringing Live.me, a livestreaming app, to the United States.\u00c2\u00a0One advantage these companies may have is that they can take the best features already popular in China, and then localize them for the rest of the world.</p>\n<p>And even if only a fraction of those features actually take off in the United States, China could provide a directional product roadmap for the space, as it has with <a href=\"https://a16z.com/2015/08/06/wechat-china-mobile-first/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">other mobile-first innovation</a>.</p>\n<h5>#16 Livestreaming may be an answer to loneliness</h5>\n<p>One of the most surprising statistics of the livestreaming trend in China is that the most active <a href=\"http://mt.sohu.com/20160523/n450929319.shtml\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">hours</a> are between 10pm and 4am, with peak usage at midnight.</p>\n<p>As the late Heath Ledger once said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI think the most common cause of insomnia is simple: it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s loneliness.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Loneliness is obviously a <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/06/health/lonliness-aging-health-effects.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">universal</a>\u00c2\u00a0and growing\u00c2\u00a0phenomenon, but it\u2019s somewhat of an epidemic in China for a few reasons: Most people who were born after 1979 are \u00e2\u0080\u009conly children\u00e2\u0080\u009d due to the one-child policy. Many people who work in Tier 1 mega-cities such as Beijing and Shanghai moved there for work \u2014 they\u2019re living far away from family, childhood friends, and college friends. And for people from lower-tier cities,\u00c2\u00a0livestreaming provides \u00e2\u0080\u009caccess\u00e2\u0080\u009d to things previously unseen let alone experienced.</p>\n<p>Livestreaming lets broadcasters and viewers instantly interact with others, beyond\u00c2\u00a0the context of dating or even making new friends. And it allows people to do so in real-time, right when they feel particularly low.</p>\n<p>Livestreaming is basically a new form of <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/07/magazine/07awareness-t.html?_r=0\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ambient and digital intimacy</a>.\u00c2\u00a0If social media is just a new tool for an old behavior (to borrow from Clay Shirky), then technologies on the social web addressed our need for connection not just information. Perhaps livestreaming addresses, for some, the need for entertainment-as-companionship. It certainly changes behavior in ways that even people who thought they\u00e2\u0080\u0099d never livestream report; as one person <a href=\"http://www.dailydot.com/upstream/younow-livestreaming-platform/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">shared</a>, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI used to be nervous to talk to one person, now I am talking to 1,100 people at a time. I love these people who come in my broadcast and say, \u00e2\u0080\u0098I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m so shy, I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll ever broadcast.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll stop songs and give a whole speech. Why not broadcast? It changes everything.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u009d</p>\n<p><em>Thanks to L\u00c3\u00a9o Wang for his research help this summer.</em></p>\n<p><em>Editor: Sonal Chokshi @smc90</em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The views expressed here are those of the individual AH Capital Management, L.L.C.

Video. Podcasts. Newsletters.", "crawled": true, "body": "\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Crypto protocols are meant to be governed by decentralized communities of stakeholders. Not because it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s more efficient, or important for ideological reasons, but because it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s necessary to unlock their core value proposition: that the underlying protocols will continue to run as designed, and will remain open to anyone who wants to use or build on them, without having the rules shift under their feet.\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Bitcoin is the original embodiment of these concepts, creating the first internet-native money at scale. But they are equally applicable (and valuable) to other types of open financial primitives as well, including things like </span><a href=\"https://makerdao.com/en/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">borrowing</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, </span><a href=\"https://compound.finance/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">lending</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, </span><a href=\"https://uniswap.org/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">trading</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, and so on. Though the specific application may differ, the need for decentralized governance remains the same.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">For crypto startups, transitions towards community governance are complicated, and raise difficult questions around ongoing development, voter participation, and incentive alignment between stakeholders. But they are ultimately necessary in order for the protocols to transcend their original developers and provide enduring value as open financial infrastructure.\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">As committed stakeholders in many of these networks, we wanted to briefly expand on how we at a16z think about crypto governance, and how we see our role in it going forward.</span></p>\n<p><b>Put simply, our primary objective in governance is to create the conditions necessary for protocols to achieve long-term adoption and self-sustainability.</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> As a general principle, we believe that protocols that achieve greater decentralization along certain key dimensions \u00e2\u0080\u0094 voting power, development work, economic upside, etc. \u00e2\u0080\u0094 are more likely to reach this ultimate goal than those that do not. As a result, we focus our governance efforts on those initiatives that have the effect of increasing decentralization in these key areas. We believe this is the highest-leverage way for us to participate and is more likely to hasten the transition of the underlying protocols towards long-term sustainability than any other approach.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">What are some examples of this?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>1.</strong> </span><b>Delegated Voting</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Over the last year or so we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen significant innovation in token-based governance models among leading crypto applications. One of the most important new features to emerge is delegated voting, which allows token holders to transfer their voting rights to others so that those delegates may more actively participate in governance. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">We are strong supporters of delegation and view it as an important tool to increase the overall diversity of perspectives in governance, to reduce the concentration of voting power across the network, and to increase overall engagement throughout the community. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s why we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve committed to delegating a significant portion of our voting power in networks like Compound, Uniswap, and others to a wide range of qualified participants.\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Given the implications of these decisions, we take this responsibility seriously and look for candidates who not only bring diverse perspectives, but also meet other key criteria. These include things like:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Alignment</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. Are they aligned with the protocol\u00e2\u0080\u0099s overall success, or do they have potential sources of conflict?\u00c2\u00a0</span></li>\n<li><b>Commitment</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. Are they committed to the protocol\u00e2\u0080\u0099s long-term health and sustainable growth, or do they take a more short-term approach?\u00c2\u00a0</span></li>\n<li><b>Independence</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. Are they fully independent and arms-length from a16z, such that they can freely vote as they see fit in the best interest of the protocol?</span></li>\n<li><b>Expertise</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. Do they have a sufficient degree of expertise, or are they still learning the core subject matter?\u00c2\u00a0</span></li>\n<li><b>Stewardship</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. Are they overall good stewards and representatives for the protocol and its underlying mission?\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">For participants who meet these criteria, we delegate a meaningful amount of voting power, and ensure that they have full discretion to participate in governance as they see fit. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Who are some of the early examples that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve selected so far?\u00c2\u00a0</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">They include student-run organizations (like </span><a href=\"https://blockchain.stanford.edu/\">Stanford Blockchain Club</a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, </span><a href=\"https://orgs.law.harvard.edu/hlsbfi/\">Harvard Law Blockchain &amp; Fintech Initiative</a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, </span><a href=\"https://www.blockchainatucla.com/\">Blockchain at UCLA</a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, and </span><a href=\"https://blockchain.berkeley.edu/\">Blockchain at Berkeley</a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">) who are passionate about crypto and represent the next generation of crypto leaders. They include existing crypto companies (like </span><a href=\"https://www.argent.xyz/\">Argent</a> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">and </span><a href=\"https://www.dharma.io/\">Dharma</a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">) who have experience building on the underlying protocols and engaging with their communities. They include industry experts (like </span><a href=\"https://gauntlet.network/\">Gauntlet</a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">) who specialize in protocol governance and bring a quantitative rigor to the discipline. These are only a few early examples, and we look forward to seeing an even more diverse ecosystem of delegates emerge over time. </span>Let us know if that might be you<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">!</span></p>\n<p><b>2. Protocol Grant Programs</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Many protocols today possess significant financial resources in the form of their on-chain treasuries. These treasuries represent a powerful tool that can be used to fund ongoing development from the community and set the protocol on a path towards long-term sustainability.\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">We support governance initiatives (such as grant programs) that look to strategically deploy these funds over time, and believe they are beneficial for a number of reasons. First, they allow a protocol to leverage an immense amount of third-party developer talent and resources around the world, far greater than any one company or developer team could bring to bear. Second, and relatedly, they create a meaningful economic opportunity for a variety of people around the world who would otherwise not have access to this work, or would be forced to do it for free. And finally, they reduce the degree of reliance on the efforts of the original development team, which may in turn reduce regulatory risk for the protocol in certain key contexts.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">To give a concrete example, Uniswap token holders control an on-chain treasury worth over </span>$7 billion<span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> (vesting over the next four years). These funds can be used to incentivize things like gas optimizations for the underlying protocol, or integrations with other apps, or new front-end interfaces, or even marketing activities designed to boost growth. They could even be used to fund protocol delegates to further decentralize the governance process, as discussed above. We were excited to support the creation of a formal </span><a href=\"https://app.uniswap.org/#/vote/3\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Uniswap grant program</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> last year, and look forward to supporting similar efforts to incentivize community engagement in other protocols as well.</span></p>\n<p><b>3. Early Adopter Rewards</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Finally, we believe that token distribution models that reward bonafide early users and contributors are likely to create more engaged communities, and therefore more sustainable protocols. These are the types of users and developers who add value </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">before</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> a protocol achieves real network effects, or even has much inherent utility. Examples include </span><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/meet-turkeys-unexpected-winners-of-uniswaps-uni-giveaway\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">the early users</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> and liquidity providers on Uniswap and </span><a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/defi-startups-built-on-compound-weigh-what-to-do-with-200-comp-tokens\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">the early developers</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> who built applications on top of Compound. We believe that these are the types of users who are likely to be the best long-term stewards of the protocol. While any token distribution model must take into account regulatory considerations, we generally believe that efforts to reward these types of early adopters are likely to position a protocol for long-term success, and we look to support them wherever possible.\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">***</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Protocols that achieve meaningful decentralization are more likely to gain long-term adoption and sustainability than those that do not. While the potential design space of governance is massive, we remain guided by this basic principle, and support initiatives that we feel embody it. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve provided a few such examples here, and look forward to helping identify and develop others that may emerge over time.</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The views expressed here are those of the individual AH Capital Management, L.L.C.

Web3 is the next big leap for computing. As the world recovers from a pandemic, the way we work and live has changed, and you no longer need to live in Silicon Valley to build amazing technology companies. All of this opens up opportunities for founders all over the world to create brilliant new things.</p>\n<p>At the same time, it is still incredibly *hard* to build a company and break through to grab people\u00e2\u0080\u0099s attention. The playbooks for success are changing, and things like legacy media and paid advertising, which used to work a decade ago when launching companies, are less effective now.</p>\n<p>Enter <a href=\"https://prologue.xyz/\">Prologue</a>, a unique company with an audacious vision: to help the best founders around the world level up and break through the noise. Today, Prologue brings together two brands \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Product Hunt and Hyper \u00e2\u0080\u0093 with more to come in the future. At a16z we always ask, \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf this works, how big could it be?\u00e2\u0080\u009d If Prologue succeeds, it could transform how startups are created by providing a unique combination of funding, distribution, community, and world class expertise to founders globally.</p>\n<p>Why these two entities? Prologue\u00e2\u0080\u0099s aim is to create a flywheel that attracts, funds, and amplifies the best early-stage startups. To put it simply, Product Hunt identifies breakout startups and Hyper helps them get the funding they need to build.</p>\n<p>Product Hunt is a community driven platform that needs no introduction for anyone passionate about building products or startups. Household names like Stripe, Robinhood, Shopify, and Zoom use it to introduce their latest products and features to the world because it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a millions-strong community of builders who are passionate about the latest products in tech. I myself have spent countless hours over the years discovering and discussing new launches on Product Hunt. The future is exciting for Product Hunt and as Silicon Valley continues to decentralize, their strong global community will be invaluable to identifying the next unicorns.</p>\n<p>Hyper is a $60m early stage venture firm that focuses on finding and funding a small group of exceptional founders a few times a year and helping them \u00e2\u0080\u009clevel up,\u00e2\u0080\u009d especially with networks, distribution, and hiring. They\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve now completed their first season, with excellent feedback from founders. According to one founder in the program: \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe humans of Hyper are unmatched\u00e2\u0080\u00a6I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be recommending Hyper to any team that is on a good trajectory and could be 10x\u00e2\u0080\u0099d by a few magic half-court shots.\u00e2\u0080\u009d</p>\n<p>To build something so ambitious \u00e2\u0080\u0093 a fund + incubator + community platform \u00e2\u0080\u0093 you need a special team that has been through the startup-building trenches and has deep ties to the broader startup community. The founders of Prologue and the team around them are uniquely positioned to make this happen.</p>\n<p>Shahed Khan was most recently the co-founder of Loom where a16z built a relationship with him and the team while leading their $130M Series C. He has seen it all in terms of building a fast-growing company. Ashley Higgins, CEO of Product Hunt, brings deep community, operational, and product expertise from a decade of building products and new lines of business at hyper-growth startups. In her time at Reddit, she learned the importance of harnessing the passion and power of the community to evolve the product for the better. Josh Buckley has been a core part of the Silicon Valley ecosystem for over a decade, from cofounding Mino Games to becoming a successful investor in his own right.</p>\n<p>I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m thrilled to announce that a16z is leading a $23M funding round for Prologue and that I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be joining the board. Furthermore, a16z will be supporting Prologue in multiple ways. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be advising on Product Hunt, doing office hours for Hyper companies, and deeply engaged in the upcoming Prologue Summit, an upcoming invite-only technology and media conference, and more!</p>\n<p>It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s early days but we are excited for what this means for early stage companies and the startup ecosystem we all care so deeply about.</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p><i>The views expressed here are those of the individual AH Capital Management, L.L.C.

A charge-off occurs when a consumer fails to make payment for a period of time\u00e2\u0080\u0094usually six months\u00e2\u0080\u0094and the lender writes off the debt as unlikely to be repaid. Although banks have set aside massive </span><a href=\"https://a16z.com/2020/07/30/fintech-newsletter-july-2020/#covid-impact-on-banks\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">loan loss provisions</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, charge-offs actually </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">declined</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> in the month of June. However, that encouraging trend may be short-lived. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s likely that government stimulus measures have simply delayed the inevitable cliff, unless we are able to return to normalcy soon (or pass another extension). Surveys of borrowers show that a meaningful chunk of stimulus checks\u00e2\u0080\u0094</span><a href=\"https://www.bankrate.com/surveys/coronavirus-and-stimulus-checks/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">approximately 25 percent</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u00e2\u0080\u0094went to paying down debt.

First, trading activity and volatility are spiking like we haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t seen since the 2008 crisis. When the markets are uncertain\u00e2\u0080\u0094especially when the market drops 35 percent in a short period of time\u00e2\u0080\u0094people tend to spend more time looking at their portfolios and checking their brokerage to monitor their positions. In addition, when interest rates are low (they dropped to zero in March), returns on bonds and savings accounts are low and cash yield is zero. Thus, investors spend more time looking for alternatives to invest more of their capital into the markets. While trading activity spikes are more often a reflection of the movements of large institutional players, rather than retail investors, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve also seen a jump in trading from the latter group this year. </span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/a16z_Airline-Stocks.png?ssl=1\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-301234\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"433\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/a16z_Airline-Stocks.png?resize=700%2C433&amp;ssl=1\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/a16z_Airline-Stocks.png?resize=1024%2C633&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/a16z_Airline-Stocks.png?resize=300%2C185&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/a16z_Airline-Stocks.png?resize=768%2C475&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/a16z_Airline-Stocks.png?resize=125%2C77&amp;ssl=1 125w, https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/a16z_Airline-Stocks.png?resize=534%2C330&amp;ssl=1 534w, https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/a16z_Airline-Stocks.png?resize=1019%2C630&amp;ssl=1 1019w, https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/a16z_Airline-Stocks.png?w=1310&amp;ssl=1 1310w\" width=\"700\"/></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/a16z_Cruise-Stocks.png?ssl=1\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-301235\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"432\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/a16z_Cruise-Stocks.png?resize=700%2C432&amp;ssl=1\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/a16z_Cruise-Stocks.png?resize=1024%2C632&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/a16z_Cruise-Stocks.png?resize=300%2C185&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/a16z_Cruise-Stocks.png?resize=768%2C474&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/a16z_Cruise-Stocks.png?resize=125%2C77&amp;ssl=1 125w, https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/a16z_Cruise-Stocks.png?resize=534%2C330&amp;ssl=1 534w, https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/a16z_Cruise-Stocks.png?resize=1020%2C630&amp;ssl=1 1020w, https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/a16z_Cruise-Stocks.png?w=1310&amp;ssl=1 1310w\" width=\"700\"/></a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The airline and the cruise stocks were front and center at the height of the crash.

But this year, retail investors were much more apt to make short term bets on the market\u00e2\u0080\u0094and trade much more frequently. Obviously, day trading and options trading thrive in periods of high volatility, which explains some of the interest and spikes. Another possible culprit is the fact that sports (and, by extension, sports betting) and casinos were closed for a large part of the year. As a result, trading options became the closest thing available to gambling. In any case, whereas options and short term investing by retail traders was previously on a steady decline in comparison to long term strategies of \u00e2\u0080\u009cbuy and hold,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the pandemic seems to have sparked a resurgence.</span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/a16z_Fractional-Shares.png?ssl=1\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-301238\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"432\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/a16z_Fractional-Shares.png?resize=700%2C432&amp;ssl=1\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/a16z_Fractional-Shares.png?resize=1024%2C632&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/a16z_Fractional-Shares.png?resize=300%2C185&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/a16z_Fractional-Shares.png?resize=768%2C474&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/a16z_Fractional-Shares.png?resize=125%2C77&amp;ssl=1 125w, https://i2.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/a16z_Fractional-Shares.png?resize=535%2C330&amp;ssl=1 535w, https://i2.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/a16z_Fractional-Shares.png?resize=1021%2C630&amp;ssl=1 1021w, https://i2.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/a16z_Fractional-Shares.png?w=1311&amp;ssl=1 1311w\" width=\"700\"/></a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Fractional shares and zero cost trades are some most important developments for democratizing access to the stock market, which in turn unlocks social trading and experiences. Fractional shares mean anyone can participate in the ownership economy with as little as a dollar. This trend is even more interesting globally. Whereas approximately 60 percent of households in the US already own stocks, in India, for example, that number is less than 1 percent. In the next few years, we expect global participation in the stock market to skyrocket due to fractional shares.</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><div data-toc-header=\"Small business impact\" id=\"section--3\"></div>Small business impact: We\u2019re exploring our options with side-gigs and supplemental income<br/>\n</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Many </span><b>small business owners and entrepreneurs</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> are navigating uncharted waters amid widespread economic uncertainty.

But it\u2019s likely due to a combination of factors. Of course, those who couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t go to a branch needed to open up an account online.

For the loan to be forgiven, PPP stipulations state that the recipient can only use the loan proceeds to pay for specific items: payroll (60 percent of the loan), as well as rent, utilities and interest on debt (no more than 40 percent). Having an additional, separate account ensures that the small business can separately track how they spent the loan\u00e2\u0080\u0094and have proof for their lender at the time of loan forgiveness.\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">This phenomenon presents an interesting opportunity for SMB-focused fintech companies like Azlo, which offer deposit accounts to attract new customers, as well as a number of SMB software companies like Intuit and Shopify, which recently embedded bank accounts into their software.</span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/a16z_Dropshipping.png?ssl=1\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-301240 aligncenter\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"432\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/a16z_Dropshipping.png?resize=700%2C432&amp;ssl=1\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/a16z_Dropshipping.png?resize=1024%2C632&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/a16z_Dropshipping.png?resize=300%2C185&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/a16z_Dropshipping.png?resize=768%2C474&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/a16z_Dropshipping.png?resize=125%2C77&amp;ssl=1 125w, https://i0.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/a16z_Dropshipping.png?resize=534%2C330&amp;ssl=1 534w, https://i0.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/a16z_Dropshipping.png?resize=1020%2C630&amp;ssl=1 1020w, https://i0.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/a16z_Dropshipping.png?w=1310&amp;ssl=1 1310w\" width=\"700\"/></a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Many Americans are launching side hustles to supplement diminished or lost income from layoffs or furloughs.

The ability to layer in social for core banking is an intriguing opportunity. Many of the top five banks currently allow online account opening, but if you want a joint account, both people still have to show up in a physical branch.

Video. Podcasts.

But it turns out that the experience is far worse, and thus the opportunity perhaps even bigger, in many other parts of the world.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">S\u00c3\u00a3o Paulo, one of the largest cities on earth, sports some interesting facts about residential real estate:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">There is no broker exclusivity, so if you hire a broker to sell your house, he/she will not show it to other brokers, because *they* will try to have you hire them to also sell your house. Whoever brings the buyer gets the commission.</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">There is a very small fix-and-flip market in Brazil. Why is this important? In the US, a dilapidated house on a nice lot will sell quickly, because somebody will fix it up and sell it. Location, location, location, right? But there needs to be financing for this arbitrage (or as I see it, liquidity) \u2014 in the US, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a nearly $100B fix-and-flip financing market (which yielded our investment in PeerStreet). In Brazil, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s virtually non-existent, so old houses sit on the market much longer because there is much less arbitrage to fix this problem.</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Compounding that problem, many buyers want newer/refurbished homes, but don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know what homes would cost to renovate, so avoid older housing stock. A seller might make some improvements that a buyer doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want, further creating waste (this happens in the US as well).</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">There is no central listing exchange, or what in the US we call the MLS (multiple listings service). In the US, things like Opendoor are exciting because by aggregating proprietary supply they can potentially build a transactional MLS. But in Brazil, there isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even a non-transactional MLS!</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">There is a *lot* of vertical housing stock. Why is this important? It makes automated valuation models (AVMs) much easier to run, so a well-tuned buyer of homes can programmatically buy, refurbish (more cookie cutter than Picasso homes), and sell.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The net result is that homes sit on the market far longer because of a lack of information and capital.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Enter Loft. We were excited to lead their Series A in July of 2018, even more excited to co-lead their Series B, and now further increase our ownership in their Series C. They are building a transactional marketplace for the biggest asset class in the world, starting in the biggest market in Latin America, on a time horizon that makes it hard to believe it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been less than a year since the PowerPoint. They buy homes, fix them (often according to formulaic specifications provided by active buyers), and sell them \u2014 what is now known as \u00e2\u0080\u009ci-buying,\u00e2\u0080\u009d with the vision of turning this into a transactional marketplace.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">We are thrilled to partner with the founders, Mate and Florian, and the 400+ person strong team down there.\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Vamos!</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The views expressed here are those of the individual AH Capital Management, L.L.C.

Though it originated in Europe, GDPR is a form of long-arm jurisdiction that affects many U.S. companies \u2014 including most software startups, because data collection and user privacy touch so much of what they do.

Then expand that surface into many more than three dimensions, to account for the dozens of required properties of a successful medicine \u2014 target affinity, biological function, safety, manufacturability, and more. This is what drug discovery is like. If each point on this vast surface is a drug, how do you find the best one? How do you avoid prematurely optimizing along just a single parameter, and missing the most useful candidates entirely?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now bring this framework to biologic drugs\u00e2\u0080\u0094one of the fastest-growing and most impactful categories of new therapeutic products.

Biologics are, in principle, among our most </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">programmable medicines</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: unlike small molecule drugs, every protein therapeutic has an underlying genetic sequence. But biologic drugs also pose unique challenges (e.g., stability, immunogenicity), adding many more dimensions to manage. So which (of many) protein sequences will solve the therapeutic problem at hand? How do you optimize enough, but not too much, and not too early?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The traditional approach to solving this problem relies on experimental screens with large sequence libraries. These have been the workhorses of antibody discovery for a long time, with growing library sizes, and incrementally improving in-vitro display technologies. But even a very large library (e.g. 10^13 sequences) only captures the diversity of ~10 amino acids (20^10 sequences). The relevant search space for most protein therapeutics spans a much longer range (e.g., 50-250 amino acids), which would require library sizes that are many orders of magnitude larger. As a result, experimental screens represent only a tiny fraction of all </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">possible </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">sequences.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is where machine learning can be so powerful. </span><a href=\"https://www.bighatbio.com/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">BigHat Biosciences</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is building a combined experimental and computational platform for the future of biologic drug design, moving from a screening-driven mindset towards iterative engineering.

It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s about office design, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s about screening out the wrong kinds of employees, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s about values, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s about fun, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s about alignment, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s about finding like-minded employees, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s about being cult-like.</p>\n<p>So what is culture? Does culture matter? If so, how much time should you spend on it?</p>\n<p>Let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s start with the second question first. The primary thing that any technology startup must do is build a product that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s at least 10 times better at doing something than the current prevailing way of doing that thing. Two or three times better will not be good enough to get people to switch to the new thing fast enough or in large enough volume to matter. The second thing that any technology startup must do is\u00c2\u00a0<em>to take the market</em>. If it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s possible to do something 10X better, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also possible that you won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be the only company to figure that out. Therefore, you must take the market before somebody else does. Very few products are 10X better than the competition, so unseating the\u00c2\u00a0<em>new</em>\u00c2\u00a0incumbent is much more difficult than unseating the old one.</p>\n<p>If you fail to do both of those things, your culture won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t matter one bit. The world is full of bankrupt companies with world-class cultures. Culture does not make a company.</p>\n<p>So, why bother with culture at all? Three reasons:</p>\n<p>1. It matters to the extent that it can help you achieve the above goals.</p>\n<p>2. As your company grows, culture can help you preserve your key values, make your company a better place to work and help it perform better in the future.</p>\n<p>3. Perhaps most importantly, after you and your people go through the inhuman amount of work that it will take to build a successful company, it will be an epic tragedy if your company culture is such that even you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to work there.</p>\n<h2>Creating a company culture</h2>\n<p>In this post, when I refer to company culture, I am not referring to other important activities like company values and employee satisfaction. Specifically, I am writing about designing a way of working which will:</p>\n<p><strong>Distinguish you from competitors</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Ensure that critical operating values persist such as\u00c2\u00a0<em>delighting</em>\u00c2\u00a0<em>customers</em>\u00c2\u00a0or\u00c2\u00a0<em>making beautiful products</em></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Help you identify employees that fit with your mission</strong></p>\n<p>Culture means lots of other things in other contexts, but the above will be plenty to discuss here.</p>\n<p>When you start implementing your culture, keep in mind that most of what will be retrospectively referred to as your company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s culture will not be designed in, but will evolve over time based on the behavior of you and your early employees. As a result, you will want to focus on a small number of cultural design points that will influence a large number of behaviors over a long period of time.</p>\n<p>In Jim Collins\u00e2\u0080\u0099 massively successful book\u00c2\u00a0<em>Built to Last</em>, he wrote that one of the things that long lasting companies he studied have in common is a \u00e2\u0080\u009ccult-like culture\u00e2\u0080\u009d. I found this description to be confusing because it seems to imply that as long as your culture is weird enough and you are rabid enough about it, you will succeed on the cultural front. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s related to the truth, but not actually true. In reality, Collins was right that a properly designed culture often ends up looking cult-like in retrospect, but that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not the initial design principle. You needn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think hard about how you can make your company seem bizarre to outsiders. However, you do need to think about how you can be provocative enough to change what people do every day.</p>\n<p>Ideally, a cultural design point will be trivial to implement, but will have far reaching behavioral consequences. Key to this kind of mechanism is shock value. If you put something into your culture that is so disturbing that it always creates a conversation, it will change behavior. As we learned in\u00c2\u00a0<em>The Godfather</em>, ask a Hollywood mogul to give someone a job and he might not respond. Put a horse\u00e2\u0080\u0099s head in his bed and unemployment will drop by one. Shock is a great mechanism for behavioral change.</p>\n<p>Here are three examples:</p>\n<p><strong><em>Desks made out of doors\u00c2\u00a0</em>\u00e2\u0080\u0093</strong> Very early on, Jeff Bezos, founder and CEO of Amazon.com, envisioned a company that made money by delivering value\u00c2\u00a0<em>to</em>\u00c2\u00a0rather than extracting value\u00c2\u00a0<em>from</em>\u00c2\u00a0its customers. In order to do that, he wanted to be both the price and customer service leader for the long run. You can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t do that if you waste a lot of money. Jeff could have spent years auditing every expense and raining hell on anybody who overspent, but he decided to build frugality into his culture. He did it with an incredibly simple mechanism: all desks at Amazon.com for all time would be built by buying cheap doors from The Home Depot and nailing legs to them. These door desks are not great ergonomically nor do they fit with Amazon.com\u00e2\u0080\u0099s $100+ billion market capitalization, but when a shocked new employee asks why she must work on a makeshift desk constructed out of random Home Depot parts, the answer comes back with withering consistency: \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe look for every opportunity to save money so that we can deliver the best products for the lowest cost.\u00e2\u0080\u009d If you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t like sitting at a door, then you won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t last long at Amazon.</p>\n<p><em><strong>$10 per minute \u00e2\u0080\u0093</strong>\u00c2\u00a0</em>When we started Andreessen Horowitz, Marc and I wanted the firm to treat entrepreneurs with great respect. We remembered how psychologically brutal the process of building a company was. We wanted the firm to respect the fact that in the bacon and egg breakfast of a startup, we were with the chicken and the entrepreneur was the pig: we were involved, but she was committed. We thought that one way to communicate respect would be to always be on time to meetings with entrepreneurs. Rather than make them wait in our lobby for 30 minutes while we attended to more important business like so many venture capitalists that we visited, we wanted our people to be on time, prepared and focused. Unfortunately, anyone who has ever worked anywhere knows that this is easier said than done. In order to shock the company into the right behavior, we instituted a ruthlessly enforced $10/minute fine for being late to a meeting with an entrepreneur. So, you are on a really important call and will be 10 minutes late? No problem, just bring $100 to the meeting and pay your fine. When new employees come on, they find this shocking, which gives us a great opportunity to explain in detail why we respect entrepreneurs. If you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think entrepreneurs are more important than Venture Capitalists, we can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t use you at Andreessen Horowitz.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Move fast and break things \u00e2\u0080\u0093</strong>\u00c2\u00a0</em>Mark Zuckerberg believes in innovation and he believes there can be no great innovation without great risk. So, in the early days of Facebook, he deployed a shocking motto:\u00c2\u00a0<em>move fast and break things.\u00c2\u00a0</em>Did the CEO really want us to break things? I mean, he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s telling us to break things! A motto that shocking forces everyone to stop and think. When they think, they realize that if you move fast and innovate, you will break things. If you ask yourself, \u00e2\u0080\u009cShould I attempt this breakthrough? It will be awesome, but it may cause problems in the short term.\u00e2\u0080\u009d You have your answer. If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099d rather be right than innovative, you won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t fit in at Facebook.</p>\n<p>Prior to figuring out the exact form of your company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s shock therapy, be sure that your mechanism agrees with your values. For example, Jack Dorsey will never make his own desks out of doors at Square because at Square, beautiful design trumps frugality. When you walk into Square, you can feel how seriously they take design.</p>\n<h2>Why dogs at work and yoga aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t culture</h2>\n<p>Startups today do all kinds of things to distinguish themselves. Many great, many original, many quirky, but most of them will not define the company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s culture. Yes, yoga may make your company a better place to work for people who like yoga. It may also be a great team-building exercise for people who like yoga. Nonetheless, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not culture. It will not establish a core value that drives the business and help promote in perpetuity. It is not specific with respect to what your business aims to achieve. Yoga is a perk.</p>\n<p>Somebody keeping a pit bull in her cube may be shocking. However, the lesson learned\u00e2\u0080\u0094that animal lovers are welcome or that employees can live however they want\u00e2\u0080\u0094may be societal values, but they do not connect to your business in a distinguishing way. Every smart company values their employees. Perks are good, but they are not culture.</p>\n<h2>The point of it all</h2>\n<p>In\u00c2\u00a0<a href=\"http://bhorowitz.com/how_andreessen_horowitz_evaluates_ceos/\"><em>How Andreessen Horowitz Evaluates CEOs</em></a>, I described the CEO job as knowing what to do and getting the company to do what you want.

It had unfortunately spread into my abdominal cavity \u2014 a disease called pseudomyxoma peritonei. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an extremely rare form of cancer and without a massive open abdominal surgery and associated chemotherapy, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d be dead in a few years. The diagnosis, prognosis, and recommended treatment were agonizingly painful, in part because I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve always tried to maintain a healthy and active lifestyle. I work out every day; I try to eat well; I enter 100-mile bike races; I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve never smoked; and I have older parents and a younger brother with no history of cancer. Until that fateful day last August, my health was a non-issue.\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Just a few months ago, on February 17, I had a nine-hour open abdominal surgery, intended to remove and hopefully cure me of the disease. The scar goes from my breast bone to below my waistline and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m now without a handful of organs. Fast forward to today, six months later, I am nearly recovered. In fact, so much so, that I have just returned from my annual Grand Teton climbing trip with my eighteen-year-old daughter!\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And while I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m grateful for my recovery, the challenging part about cancer is that I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know if I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m completely cured. Only time will tell\u2026 and herein lies my new, augmented mindset.\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During the run-up to my surgery, I told friends and co-workers that I planned to get through the surgery and return to \u00e2\u0080\u009cnormal\u00e2\u0080\u009d: that I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d go back to work\u00e2\u0080\u0094making investments, working with entrepreneurs\u00e2\u0080\u0094and continue to teach at the Stanford GSB, work out, and spend time with my family. I had assumed that \u00e2\u0080\u009cnormal\u00e2\u0080\u009d before was going to feel like \u00e2\u0080\u009cnormal\u00e2\u0080\u009d after. Of course, there was a flaw with that thinking. I am no longer pre-surgery \u00e2\u0080\u009cnormal\u00e2\u0080\u009d. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve changed and internalized that life is so precious and perhaps too short to be cannibalized and framed by my career. Family, friends, experiences are now, even more so than before, the priority in my life landscape.

I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t read about them, talk about them, or pay much attention to the market. Back in 2012 I was invited to an Audi Driving Experience where trained instructors spent a few hours teaching me how to drive an Audi at high speeds on a frozen lake. It was awesome. I learned about the importance of different types of driving suspension. I learned about how Audi focuses on performance and luxury. It was a fantastic experience, a ton of fun, and I learned a lot. Fast forward six months later, and I was in the market for a car. Having never previously considered an Audi, I went to the Audi dealership and leased a brand new Audi. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been an Audi guy ever since. And yet, how would Audi know that my driving experience six months earlier actually led to a purchase?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">What happened to me with Audi wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t a one-off, either. In fact, almost all car manufacturers now operate these offline driving experiences in an effort to differentiate from competitors and build brand loyalty so that, when the time is right, consumers like me think of them first. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not just car companies developing experiential programs, either. Art supply stores now offer painting classes that drive the sales of art supplies. Makeup counters at department stores offer free makeovers that convert into product sales. More and more retail and product companies are turning to experiences to introduce products to customers and create brand awareness and stickiness when traditional advertising isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t enough. An experience economy is developing that is transforming retail and customer engagement. But the software tools to manage these experiences and connect to sales and marketing systems are nonexistent or anemic. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">We expect more and more retailers and product companies will turn to experiences to introduce customers to a brand and products. But these offline experiences, often run by field or marketing teams, are poorly managed and tracked today, without ties to any sort of relationship management system. This leads to a lot of questions for brands as to the efficacy of these experiences. How do you manage communication with your customers before and after experiences? How do you tie purchasing behavior to experiences? And most importantly, how do you know if your experiences are working? In the digital world, we have a whole host of CRM and marketing automation products to manage all stages of the customer lifecycle and sales funnel. In the offline world, we have nothing close to that. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s why I was thrilled when I caught up with Jonathan Yaffe, founder of </span><a href=\"https://www.anyroad.com/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">AnyRoad</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, and discovered he was solving for this exact problem. Jonathan and his brother Daniel have spent their entire careers understanding the experience economy and working with large and small brands to better connect with their customers. Having fully navigated the </span><a href=\"http://cdixon.org/2013/08/04/the-idea-maze/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">idea maze</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> over many years, the Yaffe brothers iterated to place where AnyRoad is today and have developed the premier Experience Relationship Management platform. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">With more than 400 customers around the world, including some of the globe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s largest brands, AnyRoad is not only helping companies offer world-class experiences to their customers, but also helping them better manage and engage with their customers in an enduring way. In short, AnyRoad is CRM for the offline world. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">We couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be more excited to be leading their Series A financing and to work with the Yaffe brothers and their incredible team as they build the software stack powering the experience economy.</span></p>\n<p>****</p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The views expressed here are those of the individual AH Capital Management, L.L.C.

As AI has become more powerful, it\u2019s started to automate data capture. (For instance, AI can create data records in Salesforce from email exchanges.) But if AI can identify what data should be entered and how to structure that data, then we may not need a traditional system of record. Rather than starting with the data you happen to have and that determining the questions you can ask, in the future, people will start with the questions they want answered and the AI will gather and organize the necessary data to answer those questions. \u00e2\u0080\u0093<em><a href=\"https://a16z.com/author/ben-horowitz/\">Ben Horowitz</a> (@bhorowitz)</em></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #ed8b00\"><strong>The margin crisis.</strong> </span>A number of macro trends \u00e2\u0080\u0093 the move to cloud, AI/ML, the diseconomics of scale for data, a bottom-up go-to-market (GTM), and the shift from products to services \u00e2\u0080\u0093 are creating a downward pressure on margins, as I explored in <a href=\"https://twitter.com/martin_casado/status/1205159211325280256\">a recent tweetstorm</a>. This isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t to say that enterprise startups should sacrifice the right GTM motion or product trade-offs to protect margins. Rather, the first generation of SaaS may no longer be the right point of comparison for an attractive margin profile. \u00e2\u0080\u0093<em><a href=\"https://a16z.com/author/martin-casado/\">Martin Casado</a> (@martin_casado)</em></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #ed8b00\"><strong>Design-first, code-second product development.</strong> </span>In the past, companies would often write code first and then build the user interface as an afterthought. However, users now expect all applications (even enterprise) to deliver the same ease of use, and design and UX have become a competitive advantage. We increasingly see more cycles spent on design iteration. Products are prototyped as a nearly functional app, beta tested with users, and then code built (or possibly auto-generated) from the design. With this design-first, code-second approach, products are more dynamic and fluid, and teams can iterate on new ideas faster. While there is no substitute for product-market fit, at least now, that fit depends on design and speed to implementation. \u00e2\u0080\u0093<a href=\"https://a16z.com/author/peter-levine/\"><em>Peter Levine</em></a></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #ed8b00\"><strong>The consumerization of security.</strong></span> A number of enterprise security tools are now coming in from the bottom and then being adopted at the top. In 2019, bottom up adoption led to security hardware (such as Yubico and Thinkst) emerging at scale, and the adoption of open source tools (such as HashiCorp Vault). This trend is a major win for both enterprises \u00e2\u0080\u0093 better products \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and for consumers, since things are safer. \u00e2\u0080\u0093<a href=\"https://a16z.com/author/joel-de-la-garza/\"><em>Joel de la Garza </em></a></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #ed8b00\"><strong>Design &amp; development tools spread to other business functions.</strong> </span>Traditionally, tools made for developers and designers have only been used by those same developers and designers. But, more and more, those tools are being adopted and used by non-technical roles. For example, sales teams use Postman, an API development platform, to demo product APIs, and product and marketing teams are creating content and wireframes in Figma, a collaboration tool originally made for designers. While the trend has been happening for a while, what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s new is the intensity: adjacent roles are not just using design and development tools, but using them as an important part of core workflows in their own roles. \u00e2\u0080\u0093<em><a href=\"https://a16z.com/author/jennifer-li/\">Jennifer Li</a> (@JenniferHli)</em></p>\n<hr/>\n<h2>Company Building: The advantage startups have in machine learning</h2>\n<p>Some machine learning startup founders feel a bit of \u00e2\u0080\u009cimpostor syndrome\u00e2\u0080\u009d around competing with big companies, because (the argument goes) those companies have all the data. Yet startups can, and do, successfully compete with big companies. You can actually achieve great results in a lot of areas with a relatively small data set, if you build the right product on top of it. Jensen Harris, CTO and co-founder of Textio, and AJ Shankar, CEO and co-founder of Everlaw, share lessons learned about building an ML startup in <a href=\"https://a16z.com/2017/03/17/machine-learning-startups-data-saas/\">this 2017 episode of the a16z Podcast</a>.</p>\n<blockquote><p><em>\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere are huge valuable areas where Google or Microsoft isn\u2019t building specific, domain-specific products.

All of these require real-time answers while customers are using an app and provide huge business differentiation. Until recently, this use case was served by data teams building complex models in R and coming up with bespoke ways of serving that into production. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re now seeing the emergence of new tools, such as MLFlow, and feature stores that turn operational AI/ML into a pattern served by the architecture around data lakes. <em>\u00e2\u0080\u0094 Martin Casado (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/martin_casado\">@martin_casado</a>), a16z general partner</em></p>\n<p><em>a16z recommends: <a href=\"https://a16z.com/2020/10/15/the-emerging-architectures-for-modern-data-infrastructure/\">Emerging Architectures for Data Infrastructure</a></em></p>\n<p><strong>Standardization sets the stage for AI/ML in analytics.</strong> With the increasing adoption of standard schemas for data ingestion and transformations, downstream analytics tools are capable of automatically recognizing the semantics of a given dataset. And in 2021, look for this trend to accelerate, as ML/AI is poised to take over more and more of the rote and repetitive tasks that have dominated analyst workflows. <em>\u00e2\u0080\u0094 Peter Bailis (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/pbailis\">@pbailis</a>), Founder &amp; CEO, <a href=\"https://sisudata.com/\">Sisu</a></em></p>\n<p><strong>AI turns software into virtual experts.</strong> AI is being used to turn software into virtual expert platforms. Take Intuit, for instance. It used to be software for accountants, but now with AI, the software is becoming the expert. AI can capture, sort, and distill the knowledge of a network of accountants so anyone can access their expertise, closing the gap between what we want a product to do and the work it takes for us to make it do that thing. <em>\u00e2\u0080\u0094 Zayd Enam (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/zaydenam?lang=en\">@zaydenam</a>), Founder &amp; CEO, <a href=\"https://cresta.com/\">Cresta</a></em></p>\n<p><strong>Chief Data Officers.</strong> The importance of cloud and data have led to two notable organizational changes: digital and IT are starting to roll up into the same C-suite leader, usually the Chief Digital Information Officer, and there has been a rise in the number of Chief Data Officers. <em>\u00e2\u0080\u0094 a16z Market Dev Team</em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left\"><a href=\"https://a16z.com/2020/12/17/ai-in-2020/\"><em>Want more on AI?

Where IT used to handle equipment in the office, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s now become the geek squad for employees, provisioning and de-provisioning equipment to protect IP and ensuring applications and equipment are up and running. HR has become a strategic function for communicating to employees, managing the virtual experiences for candidates, and combating burnout. And BizOps has become the central hub for how an organization is functioning. Sales and marketing ops teams, for instance, keep the systems \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Salesforce, Looker, Marketo \u00e2\u0080\u0094 that tie the organization together running, an even more difficult feat now that these teams aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t sitting next to one another in an office. <em>\u00e2\u0080\u0094 Shannon Schiltz, a16z People Practices and Jeff Stump, a16z Talent</em></p>\n<p><strong>The ubiquity of video (and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not just live).</strong> As everyone went remote, online video became one of the most important mediums to connect, communicate and collaborate with other people. Perhaps the most interesting video innovation was a return to good ol\u2019 fashioned \u201con-demand\u201d video, particularly in the workplace. Product walkthroughs, sales introductions, all hands meetings, and more have found a surprising home in the world of asynchronous video, which allows for more reliable production and a chance for the subject to pick the take they like, while letting prospects/employees watch when they want. <em>\u00e2\u0080\u0094 Matt McClure (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/matt_mcclure\">@matt_mcclure</a>), Cofounder &amp; Head of Technology, <a href=\"https://mux.com/\">Mux</a></em></p>\n<p><strong>Remote work speeds up user research and testing, making qualitative data more accessible.</strong> When it comes to product development, quantitative user data is often retrospective, while qualitative data provides forward looking trends with higher fidelity. With remote work, user testing is more accessible and the results are more analyzable through video conferencing or voice recording. We are seeing a new set of tools for better collecting, analyzing and integrating qualitative feedback into product development. <em>\u00e2\u0080\u0094 Jennifer Li (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/jenniferhli\">@jenniferhli</a>), a16z deal partner</em></p>\n<p><strong>Community for growth and competitive moat.</strong> As remote-first becomes the norm for business and education, companies are using a surge in online gatherings and platforms to find new avenues for business and product development. In particular, the intersection of public communities and open source software is creating powerful competitive advantages \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and even moats \u00e2\u0080\u0094 that can differentiate a company from its peers and enable rapid scaling. MongoDB started as an open source noSQL database technology that built a thriving community and global brand. Elastic spent three and a half years as an open source product and community before becoming a company. And Apollo, which built a suite of tools to work with open source project GraphQL, was celebrating a million queries a month two years ago. Now, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s on its way to handling a trillion queries a month, enabled by its connection to a broader community that is building tools and services which go beyond what the company could do alone. <em>\u00e2\u0080\u0094 Prashanth Chandrasekar (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/pchandrasekar\">@pchandrasekar</a>), CEO, <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/\">Stack Overflow</a></em></p>\n<p><em>a16z recommends: <a href=\"https://a16z.com/2019/10/04/commercializing-open-source/\">Commercializing Open Source</a></em></p>\n<p><strong>The remote work boom for enterprise startups.</strong> The rise of remote work, and the digital transformation it required, validated how big enterprise startups can get.

With such rapid adoption of cloud, more and more organizations are now operating in more than one cloud platform for a variety of reasons \u00e2\u0080\u0094 to meet regulatory requirements, diversify risk, avoid vendor lock-in, etc. These organizations want solutions that provide a consistent experience across cloud platforms, giving the edge to startups against native offerings from the major cloud providers. <em>\u00e2\u0080\u0094 Ali Ghodsi, CEO, <a href=\"https://databricks.com/\">Databricks</a></em></p>\n<p><strong>Knowledge centralization in cloud data warehouse/lakehouse.</strong> Whether data warehouse, lake, or \u00e2\u0080\u009clakehouse,\u00e2\u0080\u009d more and more companies are centralizing their data and resulting knowledge assets. This cloud data storage, rather than CRMs, is becoming the organizational system of record. As more employees can access centralized data, common use cases emerge and become standardized, so that data analysts in different parts of the organization, or even at different companies, can meaningfully collaborate in ways not previously possible and without always needing top down coordination. <em>\u00e2\u0080\u0094 Tristan Handy (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/jthandy\">@jthandy</a>), Founder &amp; CEO, <a href=\"https://www.fishtownanalytics.com/\">Fishtown Analytics</a></em></p>\n<p><strong>The importance of cloud infrastructure and SRE.</strong> With the pandemic, we were forced to stress test our collaboration tools in real time. They proved more dependable than we expected, and now, we depend on them more \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and will long after some of us return to the office. This dependency has increased the importance of cloud computing and the underlying infrastructure that keep our tools dependable at-scale. Expect a continued wave of innovation in SRE (site reliability engineering) tools and how organizations structure SRE teams to keep infrastructure running. <em>\u00e2\u0080\u0094 Peter Levine, a16z General Partner</em></p>\n<p><strong>The Rise of JAMstack.</strong> Jamstack \u00e2\u0080\u0094 an approach to building website and web applications that separates the frontend and backend \u00e2\u0080\u0094 first bubbled up five years ago, but this year, COVID-19 turbocharged its adoption. As more and more of our lives moved online, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve relied on the web more than ever to serve more dynamic use cases, from e-commerce to online events, while remaining secure and performant at-scale. Major cloud providers, as well as startups, are contributing to the ecosystem of tools around Jamstack to move the security, performance, and scalability of the web forward. <em>\u00e2\u0080\u0094 Chris Bach (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/chr_bach\">@chr_bach</a>), President and Cofounder, <a href=\"https://www.netlify.com/\">Netlify</a></em></p>\n<p><strong>Data lakes drying up.</strong> Data lakes used to make sense when the data warehouse was a precious (and on-prem) resource that needed to be protected from too much data. Now, cloud-based data warehouses (Snowflake, BigQuery) and lakehouses (Delta Lake) have separated storage and compute, so that cost and latency make them the preferred approach for centralized storage. Organizations that have workflows built around existing data lakes have reasons to keep them (for now), but otherwise, data lakes have become a legacy technology that add architectural complexity with little concrete benefits. <em>\u00e2\u0080\u0094 George Fraser (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/frasergeorgew\">@frasergeorgew</a>), CEO &amp; Founder, <a href=\"https://fivetran.com/\">Fivetran</a></em></p>\n<p><em>a16z recommends: <a href=\"https://a16z.com/2020/11/12/a16z-podcast-the-great-data-debate/\">The Great Data Debate</a></em></p>\n<p><strong>From monolithic apps to microservices.</strong> The rise of Kubernetes as the cloud\u00e2\u0080\u0099s operating system has allowed apps to be distributed across clusters, across clouds, and with an edge that is close to customers for better scalability and availability. As more organizations move from small, proof-of-concept deployments to running critical workloads in Kubernetes environments, almost every capability has to be reinvented for the new world of cloud-native. Security and load balancing, for instance, are now service-to-service rather than machine-to-machine. This requires a far more intelligent (and secure) network, that can be programmed and reprogrammed easily so a wide range of roles from platform team to app teams to SecOps can perform key tracing, networking, observability and security tasks at high scale with low latency. Architectural transformations don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t happen overnight \u00e2\u0080\u0094 but, just as virtualized machines replaced on-premise servers, logically centralized, globally distributed apps are the future, already transforming gaming and financial services, with ecommerce, media, and other industries not far behind. <em>\u00e2\u0080\u0094 Thomas Graf (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/tgraf__\">@tgraf__</a>), CTO &amp; Cofounder, <a href=\"https://isovalent.com/\">Isovalent</a></em></p>\n<h3><div data-toc-header=\"SaaS \" id=\"section--4\"></div>The Next Generation of SaaS</h3>\n<p><strong>Beyond payments, fintech in vertical SaaS.</strong> Early fintech in SaaS was typically limited to reselling payments for a referral fee.

Nobody else in the company would really know, or care, about the software. But in today\u2019s world of remote work and bottom-up SaaS, the winning products provide benefits and visibility for minor users. In a financial accounting tool, for instance, all of your different managers may become minor users, leveraging the tool for annual planning, budgets, and finance approvals. A far cry from the era of Quickbooks with just a handful of finance-focused major users.</p>\n<p>When it comes to building SaaS products, this has made collaboration features \u00e2\u0080\u0094 such as versioning and commenting \u00e2\u0080\u0094 first-class citizens. And we\u2019re looking for the next gen of SaaS tools that recognize a wider set of users beyond just the buyer or major users, and that leverage APIs where appropriate to ingest information from elsewhere and communicate out in a way that helps capture discussions, memorialize decisions, and more. <em>\u00e2\u0080\u0094 David Ulevitch (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/davidu\">@davidu</a>), a16z general partner</em></p>\n<p><strong>New tools for a collaborative, user-driven sales process.</strong> As individual workers organically adopt and discover products bottom-up, the user dictates the sales process, not the traditional sales funnel. Most existing go-to-market tools, however, are still architected around the idea of an account-driven, linear sales funnel. This year, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen the first wave of new SaaS tools geared towards helping product and community management teams engage in a more collaborative, user-driven sales process. <em>\u00e2\u0080\u0094 Kimberly Tan (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/kimberlywtan\">@kimberlywtan</a>), a16z deal partner</em></p>\n<p><strong>New products for better customer collaboration.</strong> Customer collaboration is an emerging category of collaboration products that wrap the core primitives of messaging, task management, and reporting around purpose-built workflows that navigate a prospect through the entire customer journey. Before the products to manage the customer relationship within a function were useless for coordinating activities across functions (and created a painful experience for the customer on the other side of the collaboration circus). Now, an entire new set of products aim to consolidate that entire journey \u00e2\u0080\u0094 from early presales technical validation supported to implementation and customer success. For customers, this should mean a smoother sales process and a chance to escape implementation purgatory. <em>\u00e2\u0080\u0094 Peter Lauten (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/peter_lauten\">@peter_lauten</a>), a16z deal partner</em></p>\n<h3><div data-toc-header=\"Other Notable Trends\" id=\"section--5\"></div>Other Notable Trends</h3>\n<p><strong>Sea change in the chip industry.</strong> We have a bit of a perfect storm that is reshaping the chip industry and will have repercussions \u201cup the stack.\u201d For the last three decades, Intel/x86 dominated, due to a combination of superior manufacturing process and the PC as the place where computation happens. All of this is falling apart at a rapid pace: the smartphone + cloud are reshaping computing, and power efficiency requirements have led smartphones to use ARM rather than Intel chips. Meanwhile, TSMC and Samsung have surpassed Intel in manufacturing expertise, allowing competitors (most notably, AMD, Gravitron, and Apple) to build highly-competitive server CPUs. So, what does this mean for the enterprise? For enterprise founders, if you\u2019re selling non-SaaS software, you need to have ARM support on your roadmap.

This move has translated to over </span><a href=\"https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2020-07-23-gartner-forecasts-worldwide-public-cloud-revenue-to-grow-6point3-percent-in-2020\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">$100B</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> of cloud spend in 2021 alone. The dynamic of ballooning spend and a \u00e2\u0080\u009cblank check\u00e2\u0080\u009d mentality toward cloud has become a hot button issue for both engineering and finance leaders. However, actually understanding how to measure and anticipate cloud costs remains opaque due to the complexity around cloud billing.\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The lack of visibility around resource consumption paired with cloud providers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 clunky pricing and billing systems has left many companies in a lurch when it comes to managing their cloud costs and resulted in margin erosion (as explored recently in </span><a href=\"https://a16z.com/2021/05/27/cost-of-cloud-paradox-market-cap-cloud-lifecycle-scale-growth-repatriation-optimization/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">this post</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">). Cloud costs can account for 70-80% of total COGS for fast scaling companies. Even then, most companies are still tracking their cloud spend manually via spreadsheets, if at all, without truly understanding how to prioritize and improve the bottom line.\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The first step for anyone looking to optimize this enormous bucket of spend starts with visibility, and this is where </span><a href=\"https://www.vantage.sh/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Vantage</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> comes in.\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Vantage is building a cloud cost transparency platform that helps everyone \u2013 from developers to enterprises \u2013 analyze, report, and collaborate on and optimize their cloud infrastructure costs. With a single click, developers and financial operations teams can connect an AWS account and see spending broken down by resource type and trends over time. It also offers machine learning-powered reporting on forecasted resource consumption and projected spend by service or by custom tags. Most importantly, Vantage provides the </span><b>transparency</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> all teams need to control and optimize their cloud spend.\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">This is not the first time a company has set out to unravel the lengthy cloud bill. Incumbents in the space have kept the buyers away with long implementation cycles and shockingly high prices. New demands in the cloud-native era have ushered in the need for a next generation solution.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">First, managing cloud spend is a multi-disciplinary problem, involving participation from cloud engineers, leadership, and finops teams. Even though the latter two roles are served with existing solutions, engineers are often left out of the conversation. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re seeing more and more cloud engineering and devops teams taking on managing cloud spending, and demanding well-integrated solutions to their existing infrastructure. At its core, Vantage is built for developers but also serves the broader team.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Second, companies have historically only paid attention to their cloud spend after it exceeds tens of millions of dollars or in advance of a major financial event, like an IPO. Thus the existing solutions in the market are tailored for large companies with dedicated teams. However, cloud spend is not a one-time nor an at-scale problem. It is an operational problem that requires ongoing monitoring and improvements that enable early corrective action. Vantage is designed to be operational \u2013 with the upcoming notification and alerting capabilities, teams can take their minds off of constantly watching the dashboards.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Additionally, simplicity is an underrated trait especially for complex dev tools. The number of AWS services are daunting and often have complex, hierarchical nesting several layers deep. Parsing and presenting them in a clear and consumable way requires deep understanding of each cloud vendor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s subtle nuances. Many engineering teams have tried to address this problem on their own, but it can be time-consuming and expensive, especially as services change and evolve over time. Vantage provides a sleek, easy-to-use UI where important questions can be answered at-a-glance.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">When I first met Vantage founders Brooke and Ben, I realized they were the perfect duo to solve these problems. Brooke was one of the first engineering hires at DigitalOcean \u2013 another a16z portfolio company that embodies developer ethos and has product design + simplicity as its core. Ben also came from DigitalOcean and worked on the core compute Droplet product before joining AWS Container Services where he developed the core thesis underlying Vantage. The pair have been living and breathing the cloud for the last seven years and are deeply familiar with the challenges in managing complex services and resources. They are also the most humble, thoughtful, mission-driven humans I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve met. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re very excited to continue working with portfolio alumni and wrestle the cloud \u00e2\u0080\u009cbill-east\u00e2\u0080\u009d!</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<div class=\"wp-content\">\n<p>***</p>\n<p><i>The views expressed here are those of the individual AH Capital Management, L.L.C.

And as board members of early B2B companies, one of the most common questions we get asked is: how should a bottom up company think about (and get started with) pricing and packaging?</p>\n<p>While bottom up has become the <a href=\"https://a16z.com/2020/07/29/growthsales-the-new-era-of-enterprise-go-to-market\">dominant GTM motion</a> across the B2B landscape, most of what has been written about B2B pricing and packaging is not directly useful for a bottom up company. Unlike traditional B2B businesses that have lengthy pricing discovery with the buyers during the sales motion, bottom up companies often don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have a buyer or a sales team at the beginning, but rather a user journey centered around the product.</p>\n<p>Pricing and packaging is a complex topic that is heavily product and market dependent, and unfortunately, there are no easy answers. But there are some principles and mental frameworks that can make it easier and faster to get to the optimal pricing and packaging. In this post, we pull from our experiences working with bottom up companies across open source, infrastructure, and SaaS applications to provide guideposts for understanding and mapping the user journey to figure out the right product tiers, how to differentiate them, and how to price them.</p>\n<p>OK, so where to start?</p>\n<h2><div class=\"toc-mobile-wrapper\"><h4>TABLE OF CONTENTS</h4><ul class=\"toc-list\"></ul></div> <div data-toc-header=\"Start with the user journey\" id=\"section--10\"></div>#1 \u2013 Start with the user journey</h2>\n<p>It is critical to be clear <strong>what the user journey</strong> is for your product <em>before</em> thinking about pricing and packaging because the optimum pricing and packaging is derived from and maps to the user journey.</p>\n<p>The user journey refers to the stages from first touching the product (typically without paying for it) to that product being used across the user\u00e2\u0080\u0099s organization. Unlike direct sales, where the customer journey begins with the buyer, bottom up companies are often product-led and start with a user, who is typically the first step to reaching a buyer (which may or may not be the user).</p>\n<p>There are many variants of a bottom up user journey, but a surprising number of products can be mapped to the following stages.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Guide-to-Bottom-Up-Pricing-v4_User-Journey-scaled.jpg?ssl=1\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-304735\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"471\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Guide-to-Bottom-Up-Pricing-v4_User-Journey.jpg?resize=1024%2C471&amp;ssl=1\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Guide-to-Bottom-Up-Pricing-v4_User-Journey-scaled.jpg?resize=1024%2C471&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Guide-to-Bottom-Up-Pricing-v4_User-Journey-scaled.jpg?resize=300%2C138&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Guide-to-Bottom-Up-Pricing-v4_User-Journey-scaled.jpg?resize=768%2C353&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Guide-to-Bottom-Up-Pricing-v4_User-Journey-scaled.jpg?resize=1536%2C706&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Guide-to-Bottom-Up-Pricing-v4_User-Journey-scaled.jpg?resize=2048%2C942&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Guide-to-Bottom-Up-Pricing-v4_User-Journey-scaled.jpg?resize=125%2C57&amp;ssl=1 125w, https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Guide-to-Bottom-Up-Pricing-v4_User-Journey-scaled.jpg?resize=590%2C271&amp;ssl=1 590w, https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Guide-to-Bottom-Up-Pricing-v4_User-Journey-scaled.jpg?resize=1120%2C515&amp;ssl=1 1120w\" width=\"1024\"/></a></p>\n<p><strong>TIER 1: Casual organic use (freemium/base tier):</strong> The base tier is often a \u00e2\u0080\u009cfreemium\u00e2\u0080\u009d offering geared at a broad swath of users, including students, hobbyists, and the tech-curious as well as professionals. The purpose is to create awareness, a community, market education, or a wide user base from which to further refine qualified candidates for deeper product engagement.</p>\n<p><strong>TIER 2: Individual professional use (prosumer tier):</strong> From casual use, some users will mature into professional use of a product. For product-led companies where most of the value accrues to professional users (e.g., prosumers) this tier is often the primary monetization channel. For example, <a href=\"https://a16z.com/2020/06/23/a16z-podcast-building-products-for-power-users/\">Superhuman is maniacally focused</a> on providing a lot of value to a small group of busy professionals and monetizes mainly through this tier.</p>\n<p>However, for most B2B enterprise companies, this layer is more about qualifying the customer for the following tiers, than providing a primary revenue stream. For example, even though Airtable has a lot of value for professional users, this tier mainly serves to qualify team and enterprise customers who will want additional features, like \u00e2\u0080\u009ccustom-branded forms\u00e2\u0080\u009d or \u00e2\u0080\u009cdomain-restricted sharing.\u00e2\u0080\u009d</p>\n<p><strong>TIER 3: Team use (small business/team tier):</strong> Teams of users tend to have more advanced \u00e2\u0080\u009cmultiplayer\u00e2\u0080\u009d feature requirements than individual users, often around real-time collaboration, shared storage, dashboarding, version control and access control. The team tier can have a dual purpose of monetizing SMBs, and generating or qualifying leads for large organizations.</p>\n<p>For instance, design teams are often the first to buy group licenses of Figma to manage a shared design system and component library. Over time, however, usage expands to adjacent product, engineering, and marketing teams for review, hand off, copy editing, and approvals. For these customers, it is often necessary to <a href=\"https://a16z.com/2020/12/03/adding-top-down-sales-bottom-up-enterprise-startup/\">overlay a direct sales/customer success organization</a> to sell and service the next tier.</p>\n<p><strong>TIER 4: Organizational use (enterprise tier):</strong> Enterprise customers have unique requirements around security, compliance, third party integrations, user management, SLA etc. This tier is where you monetize larger organizations, generally via direct sales. For many bottom up companies, this tier eventually produces the bulk of revenue. Often, this tier is a \u00e2\u0080\u009ccall us\u00e2\u0080\u009d tier and priced to justify the use of a direct sales team.</p>\n<p>While not all companies follow this model, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been surprised at the consistency with which pricing plans tend to converge to some combination of these tiers over time.

Often the initial user of the product is not the ultimate buyer. This is the case for a number of products where developers are the initial target, but ultimately, the budget comes from elsewhere in the organization, such as IT, security, VP eng, ops, etc.</p>\n<p>Deciding what tiers to have, and which to charge for, depends largely on where you expect the bulk of the money to come from. If it\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll ultimately be the enterprise, then lower tiers are generally free, or priced to aid qualification. On the other hand, a company focused on the prosumer should think very clearly about how it prices its professional tier because that\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll directly impact top line and margin.</p>\n<p>Prosumer companies often start at tiers 1 and 2, with 2 as the sole method of monetization focused on the professional. Some prosumer companies never create a significant motion in the enterprise, and as a result, may not have team and/or enterprise packages. Dropbox, for example, has \u00e2\u0080\u009cadvanced\u00e2\u0080\u009d tiers, but the tiering is clearly weighted at prosumer and self-serve business plans.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Dropbox-Pricing.png?ssl=1\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-304738\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"398\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Dropbox-Pricing.png?resize=1024%2C398&amp;ssl=1\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Dropbox-Pricing.png?resize=1024%2C398&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Dropbox-Pricing.png?resize=300%2C117&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Dropbox-Pricing.png?resize=768%2C299&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Dropbox-Pricing.png?resize=1536%2C598&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Dropbox-Pricing.png?resize=125%2C49&amp;ssl=1 125w, https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Dropbox-Pricing.png?resize=590%2C230&amp;ssl=1 590w, https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Dropbox-Pricing.png?resize=1120%2C436&amp;ssl=1 1120w, https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Dropbox-Pricing.png?w=1830&amp;ssl=1 1830w\" width=\"1024\"/></a></p>\n<p>In contrast, open source infrastructure companies rarely have a prosumer tier, and the early packages may just be tier 1 and 4 \u2014 \u00e2\u0080\u009cfree open source\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009ccall us.\u00e2\u0080\u009d With the launch of a hosted SaaS product, an open source company may add a tier 3 package to monetize team value.

Where that transition point occurs varies by industry, product maturity, and buyers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 buying behavior. At one popular web infrastructure company, for the first 2 years, self-service was most of the revenue and grew consistently at 7% MoM. At around $10M ARR, enterprise revenue surpassed self-service, and grew to 70% of the total revenue by the time the company reached $15M ARR. At another popular open source data tooling company, this shift happened at $2M ARR.</p>\n<h2><div data-toc-header=\"Start simple and expand over time\" id=\"section--12\"></div>#3 \u2013 Start simple and expand over time</h2>\n<p>Many companies want to have tiers that address all constituencies \u2014 freemium, prosumer, SMB, mid-market, enterprise \u2014 from day 1. However, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nearly impossible for a single R&amp;D team, and GTM team to pull this off. It is far better to start with a simple model and fewer tiers (e.g. free and call us, or free and pro) and watch user engagement, what features are being used, what organizations are adopting the product, where the budget is coming from, before adding additional tiers. You can always add tiers as you learn more about the user journey, but it is difficult to remove tiers without stranding users.</p>\n<p>A very important corollary to understand: <em>the user journey is as much something to discover as it is something to shape</em>. There will be an organic evolution of how users use your product, and the more you can map your tiers to that organic behavior, the easier your life will be.</p>\n<h2><div data-toc-header=\"Avoid a discontinuous user journey\" id=\"section--13\"></div>#4 \u2013 Avoid a discontinuous user journey</h2>\n<p>The failure to map to organic user behavior can lead to a discontinuous journey, one of the most common pitfalls of bottom up pricing and packaging. Generally, this is how it happens: A startup has a vibrant community of users, but bottom up monetization is early and anemic. To \u00e2\u0080\u009clearn from the market,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the startup spins up a direct enterprise sales effort. After some initial success, they decide to invest more into that motion.</p>\n<p>While on the surface this sounds like a good idea, too often it creates two entirely separate GTM motions \u2014 one to the buyer, the other to the user. The power of the bottom up GTM model is that the bottom up motion reduces customer acquisition cost (CAC) and provides a qualified funnel for a sales team. But this requires that the bottom up motion actually bridge the user/buyer gap. Spinning up direct sales will find the buyer, but rarely provides any insight into how to direct the user journey to the buyer. In the worst case scenario, the top down motion erodes the organic adoption and causes pushback from the users.</p>\n<p>In our experience, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re far better off working to grow the bottom up base, and apply sales to qualified users within it, rather than building a separate direct sales motion that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s largely independent of it.</p>\n<h2><div data-toc-header=\"Know when to monetize\" id=\"section--14\"></div>#5 \u2013 Know when to monetize</h2>\n<p>While this can be controversial at board meetings, we lean towards growing the user base over early monetization. If you have a strong bottom up engine, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have many shots on goal. If you spoil that, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve forfeited the company. And charging aggressively early is a good way to stifle user growth.</p>\n<p>Many successful bottom up companies wait years before monetizing. Databricks, for instance, didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t charge users for three years, and instead focused on growing an active Spark community that paid off when they did monetize. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s important to remember that you can still create prosumer or team packages through registration, rather than charging users from day one.</p>\n<p>So, when do you monetize? We recommend turning on monetization when you see repeatable usage patterns among a core customer group through concrete data gathering, or when there is a clear delineation of free product features that customers are willing to pay for, and iterate from there. In some cases, startups are pushed into monetization by the customers who want a relationship with the company for support, feature direction, improved SLAs, etc. Rather than rushing out a public pricing plan, negotiate a few custom contracts with these high-interest customers. Remember, one advantage of bottom up is that you can test your pricing and packaging, try charging a small subset of users to test how your pricing impacts churn, usage, and conversion.</p>\n<h2><div data-toc-header=\"Use pricing for qualification\" id=\"section--15\"></div>#6 \u2013 Use pricing for qualification (not just monetization)</h2>\n<p>We often think of pricing purely as monetization. But for a multi-stage user journey, pricing, especially in early stages, can actually be more useful as a qualifier. Minimally, it is a strong indicator of interest. More specifically, it can be used to generate a qualified list of accounts for an inside or direct sales team, establish a formal relationship with the user, and provide insight into what aspects of the product they are willing to pay for. In some cases, it can provide a rate limiting function.</p>\n<p>How did GitHub arrive at <a href=\"https://github.blog/2011-11-01-introducing-github-enterprise/\">charging $5000 for 20 developer seats</a> when they started going after enterprises? It turns out that in the early days, they had so much inbound interest from the enterprise segment that they decided if they were to take on the distraction of building for that market at that time, it better be worth a lot of money. The price was effectively a rate limiter to qualify only those who were willing to pay large dollars. In the case of <a href=\"https://www.salesforce.com/editions-pricing/sales-cloud/\">Salesforce Sales Cloud</a>, the professional tier qualifies customers through permissions and workflows. Once the customers exceed a certain number of roles and custom apps, it shows enough momentum to have a direct sales team engage with customers for an enterprise deployment.</p>\n<h2><div data-toc-header=\"Figure out the best units\" id=\"section--16\"></div>#7 \u2013 Figure out the best units for pricing</h2>\n<p>In the cloud era, ideally pricing is usage or seat based, and the value to the customer grows with usage. However, having value track usage isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t always possible. And even if it is, there is a chance you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re in a market where the customer simply isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t used to paying for it in that way.</p>\n<p>In general, we suggest the following to determine the best unit of pricing:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>If you can do usage based pricing and value grows with usage, do that.</li>\n<li>If there is potential for team or company-wide deployment, and the more people using the product, the more valuable it becomes, then do seat-based pricing.</li>\n<li>Otherwise, align with the expectation the customer has on similar products. This generally involves tiering based on features, or selling licenses.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The one thing to avoid is selecting a pricing unit that introduces friction when customers want to expand the usage of the product, such as \u00e2\u0080\u009cdo I really need to add another seat if that user only visits the product once a month?\u00e2\u0080\u009d</p>\n<p>There is a lot more to say here, as this is one of the more complicated and significant topics in pricing. It is significant enough that we believe it deserves addressing in a future dedicated post, so be on the lookout for that.</p>\n<h2><div data-toc-header=\"Set the unit price\" id=\"section--17\"></div>#8 \u2013 Set the unit price</h2>\n<p>Bottom up doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t change the basics to actually setting the unit price. Since a lot has been written about setting the right price, and it isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t the focus of this post, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll just provide some cursory comments.</p>\n<p>For existing markets, normally the price anchoring is already set by adjacent companies, and the bottom-up wins over incumbents purely through ease-of-use and lower barrier of adoption.</p>\n<p>In new markets, price is driven by value to the customer (obviously) and the cost needed to sell it \u2014 a topic covered well by <a href=\"https://news.greylock.com/unit-of-value-a-framework-for-scaling-42c092fba887\">Jerry Chen\u00e2\u0080\u0099s unit of value</a>. The desired state is to achieve a \u00e2\u0080\u009cnonlinearity of value\u00e2\u0080\u009d that balances customer perceived value, cost of sales and the unit price so that as units grow linearly, you can charge more per unit. As the company grows, your cost of sales will go up, and the baseline pricing needs to cover the growing sales expense. In the ideal outcome, as you build more platform or collaboration features, per unit price grows too, which creates a superlinear curve of value.</p>\n<h2><div data-toc-header=\"Test and iterate\" id=\"section--18\"></div>#9 \u2013 Test and iterate</h2>\n<p>With bottom up, you have a high velocity, relatively low impact method for testing and iterating to determine the right tiering and pricing model. Talk to different segments of your customer base to understand how they perceive the product value and the alternatives. A/B test if you have a large enough user base to get statistically significant results on different price points. If not, show your customers hypothetical pricing plans and gather qualitative feedback.</p>\n<p>If you already have a pricing plan, updating it can be a real pain, especially when you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re changing the unit of value or pricing model. For example, companies often go from simple tiered pricing to more granular usage-based pricing as they mature. In that transition, it is necessary to back test your new pricing plan on existing customers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 usage data to make sure the incentives align and the new plan won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t price shock customers.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Guide-to-Bottom-Up-Pricing-v3_Guidelines-of-Bottom-Up-Pricing-scaled.jpg?ssl=1\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-304733\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"559\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Guide-to-Bottom-Up-Pricing-v3_Guidelines-of-Bottom-Up-Pricing.jpg?resize=1024%2C559&amp;ssl=1\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Guide-to-Bottom-Up-Pricing-v3_Guidelines-of-Bottom-Up-Pricing-scaled.jpg?resize=1024%2C559&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Guide-to-Bottom-Up-Pricing-v3_Guidelines-of-Bottom-Up-Pricing-scaled.jpg?resize=300%2C164&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Guide-to-Bottom-Up-Pricing-v3_Guidelines-of-Bottom-Up-Pricing-scaled.jpg?resize=768%2C419&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Guide-to-Bottom-Up-Pricing-v3_Guidelines-of-Bottom-Up-Pricing-scaled.jpg?resize=1536%2C838&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Guide-to-Bottom-Up-Pricing-v3_Guidelines-of-Bottom-Up-Pricing-scaled.jpg?resize=2048%2C1117&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Guide-to-Bottom-Up-Pricing-v3_Guidelines-of-Bottom-Up-Pricing-scaled.jpg?resize=125%2C68&amp;ssl=1 125w, https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Guide-to-Bottom-Up-Pricing-v3_Guidelines-of-Bottom-Up-Pricing-scaled.jpg?resize=590%2C322&amp;ssl=1 590w, https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Guide-to-Bottom-Up-Pricing-v3_Guidelines-of-Bottom-Up-Pricing-scaled.jpg?resize=1120%2C611&amp;ssl=1 1120w\" width=\"1024\"/></a></p>\n<p>The user journey is a critical guide for thinking through pricing and packaging for a bottom up B2B product.

In that time, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve grown to respect his optimism and ability to look for the good in people \u2014 which is critical in a job like ours, where most companies fail; teams may pivot many times on their journey to product-market fit; and where it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hard to be focused on what can go right vs. what can go wrong.

And even when it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s really hard to see the good in someone \u2014 and to be clear, sometimes it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not deserved \u2014 he tries to keep the whole picture in mind. He not only sees the best in people, he helps people get the best from themselves and the people around them. This is something every founder could use, and I\u2019m quite confident founders will feel lucky to work with him.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Finally, as perhaps the only person in the world to have served in senior product positions in the three biggest social platforms of our time, Sriram is totally qualified to receive bug reports for Facebook, Snap, and Twitter.

It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a route to market for a product or set of products. It can range from your website to a sophisticated sales force. The sale itself must be supported with the right marketing, process, and optimization strategy. Selecting the right channel is critical for any business \u2014 and products often fail because the company chose the wrong route to market.</p>\n<p>When designing a\u00c2\u00a0distribution\u00c2\u00a0strategy, one should never begin with the sales channel itself. A properly designed sales channel is a function of the product that you have built and the target \u2014 i.e., customers or market \u2014 that you wish to pursue. In mathematical notation, think of your channel (c) as the output of your distribution\u00c2\u00a0design (f) with product (p) and your target (t) as inputs, or:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:60px;\"><strong>f(p,t) = c</strong></p>\n<p>Note that this function accepts only one product and one target as input, so if you have multiple products and/or targets, you might need multiple sales channels.</p>\n<p>So what does a channel function design look like? What does (f) do? Let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s explore a basic version. First we will consider the different kinds of product designs and how they might impact your channel (c) decision. The first dimension that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll look at is how the product (p) might be delivered to the customer or target (t). There are two high-level possibilities:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:60px;\"><strong>A.</strong> It can be delivered online (examples: Box, Dropbox, Okta, Salesforce, Workday)<br/>\n<strong>B.</strong> It can be delivered only via a delivery service, a sales person, or in a store (examples: a smart watch, a robot toy, a smart security camera)</p>\n<p>The second dimension that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll consider is the amount of assistance that the product requires to begin using it, if any. These vary across a spectrum:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:60px;\"><strong>A.</strong> No assistance required (examples: Github, Slack)<br/>\n<span style=\"font-size:1.125rem;line-height:2.125rem;\"><strong>B.</strong> Minor assistance required (example: Okta)<br/>\n</span><strong>C.</strong> Major assistance and consulting/ professional services required (examples: Palantir, Pivotal)</p>\n<p>Note that the amount of assistance may change based on the profile of the customer. For a very small business, \u00e2\u0080\u009cself-serve\u00e2\u0080\u009d companies like Dropbox, Salesforce.com, and Slack might not require much assistance and so fit into category B. But for a large enterprise that expects major support especially given the size of their contract \u2014 or where the product needs to be integrated with other technology they have (e.g., migrating data off legacy servers, or connecting to other tools) \u2014 even a seemingly self-serve product will require major assistance and thus be in category C.\u00c2\u00a0This is also a typical trajectory for products that start off with viral, bottoms-up (e.g., departmental-level) adoption in the company but then end up being adopted company-wide.</p>\n<p>We can now classify various products by their\u00c2\u00a0distribution\u00c2\u00a0characteristics:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:60px;\"><strong>[A,A]</strong> can be delivered online, no assistance required: Github; Dropbox, Slack (for small companies)<br/>\n<strong>[A,B]</strong> can be delivered online, minor assistance required: Okta, Saleforce (for small companies)<br/>\n<strong>[A,C]</strong> can be delivered online, major assistance required: Oracle Financials, Palantir; Dropbox, Salesforce, Slack (for large companies)<br/>\n<strong>[B,A]</strong> not delivered directly, no assistance required: Anki Overdrive, Apple Watch<br/>\n<strong>[B,B]</strong> not delivered directly, some assistance required: Nest Thermostat<br/>\n<strong>[B,C]</strong> not delivered directly, major assistance required: EMC Symmetrix</p>\n<p>Next, we look at target decision makers; this matters because different decision making processes require different sales strategies. The key here is not so much the size of the organization, but the manner in which they make a decision. This is a subtle, but critically important point: If a business makes a decision on a product in the exact way that a consumer makes a decision, then it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s more like a consumer. If a business has a complex purchasing process with dozens of constituents that must sign off, it starts to look more like the U.S. government. Note that no matter how hard you may try, you will NOT be able to change your target\u00e2\u0080\u0099s decision making process, so you need to design your sales channel to meet their needs not yours. In this context, we can think about some example targets:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:60px;\"><strong>I.</strong> Individual \u2014 a direct consumer or a single decision maker in a company<br/>\n<strong>II.</strong> Small group \u2014 a small engineering team deciding, such as with Trello or job ATSs<br/>\n<strong>III.</strong> Entire small company (&lt;1000 employees) \u2014 for example, deciding on HR software like Zenefits<br/>\n<strong>IV.</strong> Large group \u2014 multiple decision makers, with different economic and technical motivations for deciding on the product<br/>\n<strong>V.</strong> Multiple groups simultaneously \u2014 for example, sales and marketing both needing to agree on the right marketing automation solution<br/>\n<strong>VI.</strong> An entire large company \u2014 for example, deciding on an HR system like Workday</p>\n<p>Next, we will consider some rules of thumb for designing a channel to reach these types of targets depending on the product characteristics discussed earlier.</p>\n<p>Targets I and II involve the same simple decision making process: The customer asks herself, is this something that can help me and is worth the money and effort? These targets therefore can often be sold entirely via marketing; viral\u00c2\u00a0distribution\u00c2\u00a0(if you have a product that inherently travels by word of mouth or other organic spread); and optionally telesales (particularly if you have an [A,B] product).</p>\n<p>If you are going after targets I and II and you have an [A, C] or a [B,C] product, God help you as you will surely go bankrupt.</p>\n<p>Target III decisions generally involve multiple people so are more complex, but there are clear decision makers there who can act quickly for that type of product. Still, these targets generally require a human in the loop to help navigate the decision-making process and explain the economic and technical benefits of the product in greater depth. Sometimes, this involves setting the buying criteria and upleveling the sell beyond features and benefits. This is where a salesperson can help \u2014 also positioning the product against competitors\u00e2\u0080\u0099 products or previous conflicting decisions \u2014 more effectively than a website or a product that speaks for itself.</p>\n<p>For this size of company, [A,C] and [B,C] products are typically too expensive to sell because the cost of sale typically outstrips the profit margin on the product.</p>\n<p>Targets IV-VI not only represent complex decision-making processes, but nobody inside the customer actually knows how the decision will get made.\u00c2\u00a0This isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t because the companies are stupid, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s because they are doing something they almost never do. How often does any company buy an HR system? Once a decade? If a large organization does something once a decade or the first time ever, they likely will not have a process for doing it. In particular, who gets to weigh in on the new HR System? The CISO? The CIO? The VP of Engineering? Chances are, the customer does not know yet. As a result, these targets almost always require a human in the loop and often require an in-person or field sales representative who can walk the hallways of the company to help the customer figure out how to make the purchase.</p>\n<p>If you have an [A,A] product, you might not need as much human assistance initially because the product can spread at a department level and won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t require a complex decision-making process. Note if you have a type [A,C] product you will almost certainly require an expensive in-person sales representative to help execute the now even more complex technical decision.\u00c2\u00a0The customer will expect it.</p>\n<p>Recently, we have seen these strategies play out in the market. Dropbox was able to reach targets I and II with a brilliant [A,A] product and primarily viral distribution, but they had less success with type VI targets with that same channel. This opened the door for Box.net, which built a direct sales channel (some of whom own Rolex watches) to very effectively reach target types IV through VI. In order to reach those targets, Box fulfilled many high-end requirements that moved their product from a strictly [A,A] product to a sometimes [A,B] product. Dropbox has now built an impressive direct sales force and is targeting more complex customers again; while most of their revenue is [A,A] they also ended up with sales and a sales engineering team for their larger [A,C] customers. Meanwhile, Workday\u00e2\u0080\u0099s product may have been able to be sold entirely over the phone, but to reach their primary target (VI), they had to build a high-end sales force. Zenefits went after type III customers and was able to reach them efficiently using telesales.</p>\n<p>Once you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got the basic design down, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll want to consider more target parameters such as verticals \u2014 how does the Financial Services decision-making process differ from the Defense and Intelligence decision-making process? \u2014 as well as international \u2014 do we sell the same way in France as we do in Japan?</p>\n<p>Finally, each of these channel profiles suggests a different profile for the type of sales force you build out for it. There is a difference between viral marketing (e.g., product design to enhance forwarding and so on); inside sales (e.g., telesales); and direct sales (people directly in the field or on sites meeting with customers). Certain products might be able to rely on the product\u00e2\u0080\u0099s inherent virality for marketing, but that is not a complete channel strategy as the company might be missing an opportunity to go after bigger customers with the same product.</p>\n<p>If you want to build a successful company, your\u00c2\u00a0distribution\u00c2\u00a0strategy must be a function of your product and your target market. If you insist on designing your channel based on your personality, inability to handle the diversity required to mix sales people and engineers, or a lust for Drew Houston\u00e2\u0080\u0099s business model, then please give my condolences to your employees.</p>\n", "author": "Ben Horowitz"}, "259": {"podcast": "a16z Podcast: Platforming the Future | Andreessen Horowitz", "url": "https://a16z.com/2017/10/12/a16z-podcast-platforming-the-future/", "contents": "In this hallway-style podcast conversation, OReilly Media founder Tim OReilly and a16z partner Benedict Evans discuss how we make sense of the most recent wave of new technologies...", "crawled": true, "body": "\n<iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"200\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://player.simplecast.com/dd5621ea-f533-4358-af9b-792484a58f17?dark=true\" title=\"a16z Podcast: Platforming the Future\" width=\"100%\"></iframe><ul class=\"bio-lp-subscribe__apps\" data-podcast-src=\"https://a16z.simplecast.com/episodes/a16z-podcast-platforming-the-future-4nSATRQh?dark=true\"></ul><script>window.distribImages = {};window.distribChannels = [];window.distribImages[\"Apple Podcasts\"] = \"https://a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/bio-lp_apple-podcasts.png\";window.distribChannels.push(\"Apple Podcasts\");window.distribImages[\"Spotify\"] = \"https://a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/bio-lp_spotify.png\";window.distribChannels.push(\"Spotify\");window.distribImages[\"Stitcher\"] = \"https://a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Stitcher@2x.png\";window.distribChannels.push(\"Stitcher\");</script>\n<p>In this hallway-style podcast conversation, O\u2019Reilly Media founder Tim O\u2019Reilly and a16z partner Benedict Evans discuss how we make sense of the most recent wave of new technologies \u2014 technologies that are perhaps more transformative than any we\u2019ve seen before \u2014 and how we think about the capabilities they might have that we haven\u2019t yet even considered. O\u2019Reilly has seen more than one wave of new tech make an impact over the last three decades in Silicon Valley. But this time, O\u2019Reilly argues in his <a href=\"https://www.harpercollins.com/9780062565716/wtf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">new book</a>, <em>WTF? What\u2019s the Future and Why it\u2019s Up to Us</em>, <em>is</em> different, partly because of the combinatorial inventions now possible.</p>\n<p>But we are also in the midst of so much foundational change happening so fast, that we as a society have some very large questions \u2014 and answers \u2014 to consider.

A dizzying array of jargon is used to describe the dynamics of such companies, which can make marketplace-focused posts and podcasts feel cryptic and inaccessible. Such terminology exists because there are many subtleties to managing a marketplace business, as evidenced by the Marketplace 100. The marketplace glossary is intended to demystify buzzwords for founders, operators, and tech-savvy readers alike.</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Basic Marketplace Terms</span></h2>\n<p><b>Marketplace</b><br/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Though the semantics have been vigorously debated, we define a marketplace as any platform that connects the buyers and sellers of goods or services with each other and provides infrastructure (such as reviews, payments, or messaging) to facilitate a transaction.\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">This definition becomes more complicated when marketplaces hold inventory (like Amazon) or employ providers (like Honor). </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">See: managed marketplace, below</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">.</span></p>\n<p><b>Supply side and demand side</b><br/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The supply-side provides the product or service; the demand-side acquires the product or service. In a marketplace, this usually occurs via a financial exchange from demand to supply.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In our experience, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s typically easier to jumpstart supply than demand because suppliers are economically motivated. The harder part of scaling a marketplace is figuring out how to aggregate demand. (There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a wealth of </span><a href=\"https://li-jin.co/2019/01/19/fake-it-til-you-make-it-for-bootstrapping-marketplaces/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">resources</span></a> <a href=\"https://cdixon.org/2009/08/25/six-strategies-for-overcoming-chicken-and-egg-problems\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">and</span></a> <a href=\"https://cdixon.org/2015/01/31/come-for-the-tool-stay-for-the-network\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">advice</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> on solving this chicken-and-egg problem.)\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><b>Liquidity</b><br/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The ease with which buyers and sellers can find the right counterpart in the marketplace. In other words, liquidity is the likelihood that a seller is able to find a buyer, or that a buyer is able to find the product or service they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re looking for.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Liquidity is the most critical aspect of a marketplace; without it, a marketplace isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t valuable to buyers and sellers. Most marketplaces fail because they never reach or maintain liquidity. Liquidity can be measured through </span><a href=\"https://a16z.com/2018/12/13/16-metrics-network-effects/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">metrics</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> like fill rate (aka match rate, utilization rate), market depth, and time to find a match.</span></p>\n<p><b>Network effects</b><br/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The phenomenon in which a product/service becomes more valuable as its user base grows. Here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s our </span><a href=\"https://a16z.com/2016/03/07/all-about-network-effects/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">primer</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> on network effects.\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><b>Two-sided network effects</b><br/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Marketplaces have a 2-sided network effect, wherein the network becomes more valuable as the number of users on the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">other </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">side of the marketplace increases. For instance, in a rideshare marketplace, users derive more value when there are more drivers, and vice versa. Different marketplaces have varying levels of network effects strength. (Check out our blog post on measuring network effects </span><a href=\"https://a16z.com/2018/12/13/16-metrics-network-effects/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">here</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">.)</span></p>\n<p><b>Search costs (aka search friction)</b><br/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The time, effort, and money consumers spend to search for the best product or service. In a marketplace, higher search costs create decision fatigue for consumers, as well as lower liquidity. Marketplaces can implement various features to reduce search costs, including curating or constraining supply or automating matching.\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><b>Matching</b><br/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The process by which suppliers and consumers find each other. Some marketplaces (such as Uber and Lyft) automate matching to drive liquidity. Others seek to reduce search costs by constraining the available choices\u00e2\u0080\u0094say, dating apps that select and surface a set number of potential matches per day.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">There are various ways that marketplaces architect matching:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none\">\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><b>Supply-pick </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u2013 The suppliers decide which customers to transact with. Uber and Lyft are examples of supply-pick marketplaces: the driver is presented with a passenger and has the option to opt in or out of the ride.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><b>Demand-pick </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u2013 Customers decide which product or service to buy. Examples are Airbnb for \u00e2\u0080\u009cInstant Book\u00e2\u0080\u009d listings, in which the booking doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t require host approval. Most ecommerce marketplaces are demand-pick.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><b>Double commit </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u2013 Suppliers and customers need to opt-in for a match to occur. Craigslist, for instance, is a double opt-in marketplace because users need to message back and forth in order to complete a transaction. Airbnb for non-Instant Book listings is a double opt-in marketplace. Double-commit marketplaces tend to have the lowest liquidity, since effort is required from both sides to match.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><b>Prescribed pairing <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u2013 The platform prescribes a match, potentially taking into account the preferences and attributes of each side. Lunchclub is an example of a platform that prescribes matches\u00e2\u0080\u0094users seeking to expand their professional network opt in to a weekly meeting and are automatically paired with another user in the network.</span></b></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><b>Take rate (aka rake)</b><br/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Take rate is the percentage of the gross merchandise value (GMV) captured by the marketplace. It usually varies from a low single-digit percent to the mid-30s, depending on factors like fragmentation, availability of substitutes, and operational value-add provided by the marketplace. Managed marketplaces typically have a higher take rate because they provide more value to users and cover operational expenses.</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Types of Marketplaces</span></h2>\n<p><b>Managed marketplace</b><br/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Marketplaces that take on additional activities in order to better establish trust, especially in high-value or high-stakes categories. These functions can include verifying product authenticity, providing pricing guidance, and interviewing and vetting providers to ensure quality\u00e2\u0080\u0094in some cases, even employing providers.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Managed marketplaces represent an important </span><a href=\"https://a16z.com/2018/12/21/marketplace-startups-services-more/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">evolution</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> in marketplace design and can unlock categories that are high-trust and/or -value, such as luxury goods or real estate. On the </span><a href=\"https://a16z.com/2019/08/28/where-the-opportunities-are-in-regulated-marketplaces-managed-marketplaces/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">flip side</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, managed marketplaces represent greater operational overhead and can be challenging to build into a profitable business.</span></p>\n<p><b>Vertical marketplace</b><br/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">A marketplace that is hyper-targeted to the needs of a particular industry, product category, or other group of customers with specific needs. Vertical marketplaces are often contrasted with horizontal marketplaces: Craigslist is a horizontal marketplace, while Angie\u00e2\u0080\u0099s List (which is focused on home services) and Trusted (which targets babysitting) are examples of vertical marketplaces. There are various degrees of verticalization: for instance, Slice, an online food ordering platform for independent pizzerias, is a more verticalized form of Uber Eats.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Vertical marketplaces can offer an experience that is tailored to the unique needs of a particular group of users.</span></p>\n<p><b>Multi-sided marketplace</b><br/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Aside from two-sided marketplaces, there are also N-sided marketplaces. Food delivery marketplaces are a common example of three-sided marketplaces, in that they are comprised of restaurants, delivery drivers, and consumers.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Multi-sided marketplaces are often harder to get off the ground because they need to acquire and retain additional sides of the marketplace. However, as a result they are also more defensible.</span></p>\n<p><b>Local vs. global marketplaces (or local vs. global network effects)</b><br/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The geographic scope wherein the marketplace has network effects. Global marketplaces have global network effects: an additional supply around the world creates additional value for a user in a different country. Local marketplaces are ones in which an additional user is only relevant and valuable to other users in that particular geography\u00e2\u0080\u0094i.e., they have local network effects.</span></p>\n<p><b>B2B, B2C, and P2P (aka C2C) marketplaces</b><br/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">These terms describe the supply and demand users in the marketplace: businesses or consumers. A B2B marketplace matches businesses with businesses, such as Faire (a wholesale marketplace connecting retailers to brands), while B2C marketplaces connect businesses to consumers (like, say, DoorDash). P2P, or peer-to-peer, marketplaces have individual consumers on both sides, such as Airbnb.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">This distinction can get more complicated as the line between business and consumer blurs. a professional Airbnb host, for instance, may be a \u00e2\u0080\u009cB\u00e2\u0080\u009d (business) or a \u00e2\u0080\u009cC\u00e2\u0080\u009d (consumer). At a high level, describing a marketplace as one of these categories helps to convey the dynamics of acquiring different sides of the marketplace. B2B marketplaces are typically constrained by sales, while P2P marketplaces are constrained by trust, general awareness, and category creation.</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Market Structure</span></h2>\n<p><b>Fragmentation and Concentration</b><br/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Marketplace fragmentation and concentration refers to the degree to which the volume in the marketplace is made up of a smaller number of players (concentrated) or large number of players (fragmented).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Typically, fragmentation is desirable. The risk of a highly-concentrated marketplace is that an individual buyer or seller can exert outsize influence over the marketplace in terms of pricing, gross merchandise value (GMV), etc.</span></p>\n<p><b>Homogeneity vs. Heterogeneity</b><br/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The degree to which there is variety among supply in a marketplace. A company can design a marketplace to </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">increase </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">or </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">decrease </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">homogeneity as a product choice. For instance, Uber buckets the drivers available into a small number of tiers in order to reduce search costs. Other marketplaces surface heterogeneity among suppliers: for example, Outschool\u00e2\u0080\u0094a live online children\u00e2\u0080\u0099s education platform\u00e2\u0080\u0094highlights the unique attributes of each course and teacher.</span></p>\n<p><b>Commoditization</b><br/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">(</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">verb: to commoditize</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">)</span><br/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Relatedly, commoditization is the degree to which the marketplace diminishes the variation between suppliers. Commoditized goods and services are relatively indistinguishable from the rival offerings of another supplier. Amazon, Facebook (with regards to media companies on the Newsfeed), and other aggregators are often described as commoditizing their suppliers, meaning every product is displayed in the same way, in a manner that detracts from brand differentiation.\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">To avoid overwhelming consumers with a deluge of options, every marketplace needs to commoditize its suppliers to some extent\u00e2\u0080\u0094that is, to standardize the infinite variation between products and services and to expose the relevant aspects for consumers.</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">User Behavior</span></h2>\n<p><b>Disintermediation (aka leakage)</b><br/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">This occurs when a platform\u00e2\u0080\u0099s supply-side and demand-side users utilize the marketplace for discovery, but then complete the transaction outside of the platform (e.g., finding and messaging a service provider on the marketplace, then transacting offline).\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Disintermediation can be motivated by price sensitivity (users trying to bypass marketplace fees), convenience (for monogamous transactions, it can be convenient to move the transaction offline), or by necessity (marketplaces such as Craigslist, for example, may not provide the infrastructure needed to complete the transaction on-platform).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Disintermediation is undesirable for marketplaces because it stymies growth and suppresses monetization. A number of blog posts </span><a href=\"https://www.applicoinc.com/blog/5-ways-two-sided-marketplace-ceos-can-prevent-platform-leakage/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">outline</span></a> <a href=\"https://acrowdedspace.com/post/28387454995/disintermediation-its-a-bitch\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">tactics</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> to reduce and prevent disintermediation.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Managed marketplaces combat disintermediation because they offer greater value in facilitating the transaction.</span></p>\n<p><b>Multi-tenanting (aka multi-homing)</b><br/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">When users (either demand or supply) use multiple platforms to list or search. For instance, an employer might post a job opening on multiple job search websites, or a host could list a property on multiple travel websites.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Multi-tenanting reduces the strength of the marketplace\u00e2\u0080\u0099s network effects.</span></p>\n<p><b>Monogamous vs. Polygamous</b><br/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">These terms are used to describe the relationship between supply and demand. If transactions happen repeatedly between the same supply-side user and the same demand-side user, the transactions or relationship is described as monogamous in nature. Certain categories are also often described as monogamous\u00e2\u0080\u0094home cleaning or babysitting, for example\u00e2\u0080\u0094in which buyers typically prefer to work with the same provider repeatedly after establishing trust and familiarity. Other categories are more polygamous, meaning the user has repeated, different matching needs across transactions, such as travel accommodations or food delivery.\u00c2\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Polygamous transactions are better suited to marketplaces because users are compelled to return to the marketplace on an ongoing basis for future transactions. In contrast, monogamous categories heighten the risk of disintermedation.</span></p>\n", "author": "Li Jin"}, "262": {"podcast": "a16z Podcast: Securitys Wakeup Call | Andreessen Horowitz", "url": "https://a16z.com/2014/12/03/a16z-podcast-securitys-wakeup-call/", "contents": "a16z Podcast: Securitys Wakeup Call. by Ashton Carter, John M.

If the average CFO is in a crisis, the emerging markets CFO serve are in an even bigger crisis! In LatAm for instance, existing legacy systems are even more fragile, as APIs to extract banking information generally don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t exist, payment methods are more fragmented (across banks, digital wallets and cash), and every market has its own regulation (or lack thereof!) This lack of infrastructure not only makes everyday financial tasks difficult for companies, but adds another layer of complexity to the already challenging tasks of fraud detection and credit underwriting.</p>\n<p>I got a glimpse of some of these challenges when a portfolio company of ours operating in multiple countries told me they hired an intern to log in to multiple business bank accounts and manually record the balances in a spreadsheet several times per day. They did this because there wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t an API where the company could extract their own financial information across the banks they used in a standardized and real-time way.</p>\n<p>Take a more complex case: a payment service provider (PSP) who accepts payments from multiple sources including credit cards, wallets, bank transfers, Cash from Oxxo, and other local processors (e.g., Mercado Pago, Flutterwave). In order to fully verify and reconcile payments across all these sources the PSP created:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A payment operations team where members manually log in to each payment source every 15 minutes to verify the payments have gone through.</li>\n<li>An audit team who logs in to each source to perform an offline reconciliation.</li>\n<li>An accounting team who logs in to each source to download different formats (PDF, OFX, TXT) required for audit.</li>\n<li>Support teams who would often need to also log in to verify data for customer issues.</li>\n<li>And finally an operations team would need to log in to ensure each account was running correctly!</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To add insult to this very manual operation\u2013different people logging in from different places would trigger bank security teams to block the accounts.</p>\n<p>It was this widespread PSP problem that Sergio &amp; Gonzalo, the founders of <a href=\"https://www.datanomik.com/en/\">Datanomik</a> set out to solve. After replacing the FIVE teams that were manually logging in to all accounts with an API that would extract and standardize the data for many formats across multiple sources, they realized they were not the only company experiencing this challenge. I am fond of saying that \u00e2\u0080\u009c<a href=\"https://future.com/every-company-fintech-company/\">every company will become a fintech company</a>,\u00e2\u0080\u009d followed closely by what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s relevant here: every fintech company will inspire a fintech infrastructure company.</p>\n<p><strong>Solving the crisis</strong></p>\n<p>Datanomik has built a set of APIs and a customizable platform that allows companies to have easy access to their financial information across multiple banking accounts and other payment sources. Starting with Brazil, the company plans to quickly expand to Colombia and Mexico and beyond.</p>\n<p>A B2B transaction API will benefit:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Companies operating in multiple countries (with a bank account per country, likely different currencies) who need a single dashboard to view &amp; reconcile payments.</li>\n<li>PSP who accept payments from multiple sources as described above.</li>\n<li>Any company needing business banking data to KYC, underwrite for loans etc. (vs. downloading and bank statements in varying formats)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>The team</strong></p>\n<p>Sergio Fogel, co-founder of Dlocal (first Uruguayan company <a href=\"https://www.uruguayxxi.gub.uy/es/noticias/articulo/la-fintech-uruguaya-dlocal-cotiza-acciones-en-nasdaq/\">to go public on the Nasdaq</a> exchange, a platform that helps global companies accept payments from consumers in emerging markets using local payment preferences), tapped Gonzalo Strauss, Head of Product at AstroPay (also co-founded by Sergio) and a talented engineering manager, to solve this issue internally for the team. Gonzalo quickly built an elegant solution with a relatively small team. We are thrilled to back Datanomik in solving the global CFO crisis across more countries and use cases.</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p><i>The views expressed here are those of the individual AH Capital Management, L.L.C.

COPELAND</p>\n<p><em>Fast &amp; Furious 6</em> is not in the race for Best Picture in the upcoming Oscars. All five of the preceding gearhead movies were similarly snubbed. If you are a fan of muscle cars or Vin Diesel (sometimes hard to distinguish between the two), this ongoing insult may seem unfair. But <a href=\"http://blog.modeanalytics.com/engineering-a-best-picture/\">according to analysis</a> of past Best Picture nominees by data jockey Benn Stancil, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not the mumbled lines or wooden acting that is preventing the Fast &amp; Furious crew from getting a shot at an acceptance speech \u00e2\u0080\u0093 it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s that it has virtually none of the elements required for a Best Picture win. The participation of the actor Daniel Day-Lewis for starters. Or that it not be a sequel, which, as the sixth in a series it certainly is.</p>\n<p>In an attempt to engineer the perfect Best Picture, at least by Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences standards, Stancil, who is the chief data analyst at San Francisco-based startup <a href=\"http://www.modeanalytics.com/\">Mode Analytics</a>, sifted through mountains of data collected from entertainment information outfit Rovi and the Academy Awards database. The result, Stancil says with a laugh, \u00e2\u0080\u009cis the ultimate Frankensteinian Oscar-bait.\u00e2\u0080\u009d And like Frankenstein, it could be a triumph or an abomination.</p>\n<p><strong>Crime dramas and biopics</strong></p>\n<p>As we all know without any detailed analysis required, dramas are your surest shot to an Oscar win. \u00e2\u0080\u009cFifty percent of movies nominated for any Oscar are dramas,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Stancil says, \u00e2\u0080\u009cCompared to 75 percent for Best Picture nominees.\u00e2\u0080\u009d</p>\n<p>But telling aspiring Best Picture winners to go make a drama isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t all that helpful, Stancil admits. So Stancil went deeper, mapping out a plot, themes and tones, and whom you want as your actors and directors.</p>\n<p>Crime dramas and biographical films are over-represented in the Best Picture nominees pool. To reinforce the point that dramas take home the statuette, Stancil found that comedy, science fiction, action, and horror movies all perform horribly in the Best Picture category. Out of about 550 movies of these genres nominated for Oscars of any kind, fewer than 30 were nominated for Best Picture.</p>\n<p>No sequels, the Academy hates sequels. The Academy also hates explosion-happy movies by Michael Bay. As for the writing, there is a bias toward adapted screenplays, rather than original scripts. Go figure.</p>\n<p>So, in broad strokes, a Best Picture contender a should be a biopic about crime, adapted from a previous work.</p>\n<p>Stancil next went a level down, examining the ideal themes, tones and plot elements. The best combination was a bittersweet feeling movie that involved cross-cultural relations. Movies that explore class differences, forbidden love and end with a triumphant flourish also do well in the Best Picture hunt.</p>\n<p>The worst possible film if you want the Oscar is a light-toned story that centers on kidnapping (hard to imagine that combo, yes). Evil aliens are non-starters, as are navel-gazing movies about making movies. Trashy is also a no-no, which would explain why the <em>Porky\u00e2\u0080\u0099s</em> oeuvre never made it to the podium.</p>\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-6484\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_6484\" style=\"width: 560px\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/screen-shot-2014-02-28-at-10-03-56-am.png?ssl=1\"><img alt=\"Mode Analytics\" class=\"size-full wp-image-6484\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"597\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/screen-shot-2014-02-28-at-10-03-56-am.png?resize=560%2C597&amp;ssl=1\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/screen-shot-2014-02-28-at-10-03-56-am.png?w=560&amp;ssl=1 560w, https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/screen-shot-2014-02-28-at-10-03-56-am.png?w=281&amp;ssl=1 281w, https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/screen-shot-2014-02-28-at-10-03-56-am.png?w=117&amp;ssl=1 117w, https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/screen-shot-2014-02-28-at-10-03-56-am.png?w=235&amp;ssl=1 235w\" width=\"560\"/></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-6484\">Mode Analytics</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Make your picture long.

You have a better shot at Best Picture if your male leads win Best Actor or Best Supporting Actor than if your female leads take home the statuettes.

Or was John Cazale. Unfortunately, he died 35 years ago and so isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t available. Among the living, your best choice for a male lead is either Daniel Day-Lewis or Al Pacino. The women you want in your movie include Ellen Page and Jessica Chastain. If you want to win, never cast Sean Connery, Ewan McGregor (a Scots bias here?), Eddie Murphy, Colin Farrell, or Susan Sarandon. Fine actors all, but never in the winner\u00e2\u0080\u0099s circle.</p>\n<p>In a strange bit of Hobbity luck, you might consider <a href=\"http://www.stuff.co.nz/waikato-times/life-style/9332291/Hobbit-habit-hard-to-break\">Billy Boyd </a>in a supporting role. All four of the Oscar-nominated movies in which Boyd has had parts (all three <em>Lord of the Rings</em> films and <em>Master and Commander</em>) were nominated for Best Picture.</p>\n<p>As for directors, you aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t going to do better than Marty Scorsese, who collects Best Picture nominations like some people collect Magic: The Gathering cards. If Scorsese isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t available, Stancil\u00e2\u0080\u0099s analysis recommends Norman Jewison (getting on in years though), Ang Lee, or James Brooks.</p>\n<p>Get the Weinstein brothers to bankroll and produce your film, and find a good composer. Forty-two percent of films nominated for Best Score received Best Picture nominations. Best Song nominees only entered the Best Picture running 14 percent of time. Which makes some sense if you saw <em>Lion King</em>.</p>\n<p>Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t sweat the costumes. Stancil points out that the overlaps between Best Picture nominees and Best Costumes, Best Makeup, and Best Visual Effects nominees are among the weakest of any Oscar category.</p>\n<p><strong>Coming in Summer 2015: Bullet to the Dark Side</strong></p>\n<p>Taking all that data into consideration, Stancil then used an n-gram model to crank through five-decades-worth of Best Picture nominated titles and plot synopses and spit out obvious Oscar bait movies like:</p>\n<p><em>Bullet to the Dark Side</em><br/>\nA newlywed couple is cruelly separated, then, after some dramatic struggle, they are reunited in the rugged Afghan mountains.</p>\n<p>Or:</p>\n<p>The story of a \u00e2\u0080\u009850s housewife and a disgraced cop who team up to exact revenge upon her one-time lover.</p>\n<p><em>Hurt Me, the Hidden World</em><br/>\nA suicidal former Union soldier ends up joining a Sioux tribe. He then takes up arms to defend them when they somehow become entangled with Russian mobsters in London.</p>\n<p>Or:</p>\n<p>A farmer tries to woo a wealthy uncle, meets and falls for an agnostic Roman soldier who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s somehow made an appearance during WWII. (Makes no sense, but neither did Waterworld).</p>\n<p><strong>And the winner is\u00e2\u0080\u00a6</strong></p>\n<p>So when it comes down to it, what movie does Stancil\u00e2\u0080\u0099s analysis predict will win this year\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Best Picture?</p>\n<p>\u00e2\u0080\u009c<em>12 Years a Slave</em>,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Stancil says. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a dramatic biopic, adapted from a book, highlighting social injustice, with cross-cultural relationships and crime is central to the plot. Though kidnapping is one of the chief crimes.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Stancil doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to give away the ending, but it fits the criteria too. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd I liked it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he says.</p>\n<p>There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s that, but Stancil has some thoughts on how <em>12 Years a Slave</em> could have boosted its chances even further at winning Best Picture. The cast could be improved, Daniel Day-Lewis as a slave owner and Jessica Chastain his wife. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd at only 134 minutes, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s eight minutes shy of ideal winning length,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Stancil says. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd can you imagine if Scorsese had directed it?\u00e2\u0080\u009d</p>\n<p>Slam dunk.</p>\n<p>UPDATE: Looks like Scorsese wasn\u2019t needed after all. As Stancil predicted, <em>12 Years a Slave</em>\u00c2\u00a0won Best Picture. Maybe\u00c2\u00a0<em>Bullet to the Dark Side</em>\u00c2\u00a0actually stands a chance of getting made \u2026</p>\n<p><em>This post originally appeared in <a href=\"http://recode.net/\">Re/Code</a>.</em></p>\n", "author": "Michael Copeland"}, "265": {"podcast": "a16z Podcast: When Software Eats Cars | Andreessen Horowitz", "url": "https://a16z.com/2015/08/25/a16z-podcast-what-your-ride-shares-with-your-smartphone-when-cars-and-technology-collide/", "contents": "Who will build these cars, who will own them, and who (or what) will drive them?

Does an 18-year-old heading to college want the same bank account that helped her keep track of her chores when she was 12? Unlikely. But these early digital challengers have additional product levers they can pull \u00e2\u0080\u0094 for example, the ability to unlink one\u00e2\u0080\u0099s parents from your account when you turn 18 and to get a new personalized card, or to graduate users into new credit-building features. Even if the first kid/parent banking app is not able to retain its customers past a certain age, that teen is likely more apt to choose a newer banking player over a traditional default like Chase, Wells Fargo, or Bank of America. Another challenge for Gen Z-targeting companies has been that kids\u00e2\u0080\u0099 comparatively low spending power breaks many traditional interchange-based revenue models. With that in mind, some of these early players are betting that the value they provide parents and kids will merit a monthly subscription fee.</p>\n<p>So should traditional incumbents be worried?

Very young customers were seen as unprofitable (savings from babysitting money does not typically drive high balances) and, regardless, there were not enough startups targeting this audience to pose a credible threat. That seems to be changing. An increased focus on boosting kids\u00e2\u0080\u0099 and teens\u00e2\u0080\u0099 financial literacy \u00e2\u0080\u0094 spurred, in part, by COVID-19 \u00e2\u0080\u0094 is now pushing parents over the inertia hump. In the future, as more and more companies offer financial services, non-fintech companies are likely to make a play for the loyalties of younger and younger customers, as well. This means that your child\u00e2\u0080\u0099s first bank may someday look more like a debit card with loyalty points for Robucks, rather than a piggy bank.</p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u00e2\u0080\u0094<a href=\"https://twitter.com/astrange\">Angela Strange</a>, a16z fintech general partner</span></i></p>\n<hr/>\n<h3 id=\"rocket-mortgage\"><span style=\"color: #ff6600\"><strong>What Rocket Mortgage can teach us about the future of financial services</strong></span></h3>\n<p>Mortgages underpin a major component of the American Dream: homeownership. They\u00e2\u0080\u0099re also integral to financial markets \u00e2\u0080\u0094 residential mortgages are one of the largest asset classes in the world, with over $10 trillion in debt outstanding (that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 10 times more than credit cards and student loans). And, of course, a functioning mortgage market is hugely important to the health of the American economy (see: 2008). Rates are now at an historic low, falling below 3 percent for the first time in history and driving origination volumes to all time-highs. (Take this seemingly rosy news with a grain of salt: that drop has triggered stricter underwriting criteria, which prevents many from being able to benefit.)</p>\n<p>Against this backdrop, Rocket Mortgage, owned by Quicken Loans, is filing for an IPO. Rocket is the largest mortgage broker in the country \u00e2\u0080\u0094 it grew in market share from 1.3 percent to 9.2 percent between 2009 to 2020 \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and going public means they are releasing some hitherto private metrics on their business. Understanding Rocket Mortgage is vital to understanding the mortgage market and contains important lessons as we think about the impact of technology in finance, not to mention what it means to build an enduring company.</p>\n<p>The first and most obvious trend is that investing in technology delivers better consumer experiences. Rocket has won\u00c2\u00a0<a data-saferedirecturl=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://go2.a16z.com/r00H0B1v0ZRa0AJ000000B0&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1596141638879000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHQsOInWXK0j_hMpoJ4NjClrkZJkQ\" href=\"https://go2.a16z.com/r00H0B1v0ZRa0AJ000000B0\" id=\"m_3913379376828539387\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">awards</a>\u00c2\u00a0for consumer satisfaction in mortgage origination, a complex process with lots of edge cases. By integrating software end-to-end to support the more esoteric aspects of underwriting, Rocket eliminates those headaches. Yet even that well-regarded product is far from perfect. Rocket received a lot of flak in 2016 for a Superbowl ad with the tagline \u00e2\u0080\u009c<a data-saferedirecturl=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://go2.a16z.com/XBa00yZ0A000Bs000010Jr0&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1596141638879000&amp;usg=AFQjCNG186pXIpZJ67Zt7fewoW4NDgAxXg\" href=\"https://go2.a16z.com/XBa00yZ0A000Bs000010Jr0\" id=\"m_3913379376828539387\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Push button.

A refinance typically takes\u00c2\u00a0<a data-saferedirecturl=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://go2.a16z.com/B000zJ1BA00000sZ00sa00B&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1596141638879000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHN3Ggkf5-5NgVo29FecHniaS6jvw\" href=\"https://go2.a16z.com/B000zJ1BA00000sZ00sa00B\" id=\"m_3913379376828539387\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">more than 30 days</a>\u00c2\u00a0with Rocket, which is roughly in line with industry averages. As a result of this inherent friction, many Americans \u00e2\u0080\u0094 even those with stellar credit \u00e2\u0080\u0094 don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t refinance even when it could be advantageous to do so.</p>\n<p>Second, Rocket demonstrates how, at scale, large finance companies (be they fintechs or incumbents) seek to expand into adjacent product areas. Some expansions are obvious. In addition to being an originator, Rocket Mortgage also has a servicing business that retains servicing rights on 92 percent of their originations and today supports 1.8 million clients. Other expansion areas are less obvious. For instance, Rocket will also help you with a personal loan (Rocket Loans) or even sell a used car (Rocket Auto). In the era of rebundling, every company is striving to own the full customer experience and deepen that relationship.</p>\n<p>Third, at a granular level, Rocket reveals how automation in finance may lead to job losses for workers, but savings for consumers. Rocket\u00e2\u0080\u0099s software-assisted loan officers are 3.5x more productive than their peers: they close 8.3 loans per month, compared to 2.3 for the rest of the industry. That gap is likely to increase over time. In the personal loan space, lending is nearly 100 percent automated; in the long run, the same will eventually be true for mortgages. What does that mean for the 400,000 loan officers in the country? There will be substantially fewer of them. The good news for consumers is that fewer loan officers means lower costs and more savings. Mortgage origination costs have remained stubbornly high, topping\u00c2\u00a0<a data-saferedirecturl=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://go2.a16z.com/u4A0000Z0a0B0d01u00JB00&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1596141638879000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGcO5Yl6DKPewWtF7TxFivTYu8M8g\" href=\"https://go2.a16z.com/u4A0000Z0a0B0d01u00JB00\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">$10,000 in 2018</a>. Ultimately, those costs are borne by consumers.</p>\n<p>The mortgage industry is ripe for further innovation, and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re eager to see which companies will define the next generation. Mortgage businesses are not easy to build: it took 500 Rocket Mortgage employees years. But for those companies that endure, the payoff \u00e2\u0080\u0094 both in customer impact and financial success \u00e2\u0080\u0094 could be considerable.</p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u00e2\u0080\u0094<a href=\"https://twitter.com/rexsalisbury\">Rex Salisbury</a>, a16z fintech deal partner</span></i></p>\n<hr/>\n<h3 id=\"covid-impact-on-banks\"><span style=\"color: #ff6600\"><strong>Assessing COVID-19\u2019s impact through the banks</strong></span></h3>\n<p>If you looked solely at the stock market, the economic view would seem oddly optimistic.

In a world where over <a data-saferedirecturl=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://go2.a16z.com/r00J0B1v0ZTa0AJ000000B0&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1596141638879000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHrOaDOFm-jVzaUxOtdV4qgZInOPw\" href=\"https://go2.a16z.com/r00J0B1v0ZTa0AJ000000B0\" id=\"m_3913379376828539387\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">30 million</a>\u00c2\u00a0Americans have lost their jobs and many businesses remain closed, a simplistic view of market data is insufficient. Many of the big banks reported earnings this month, and their income statements and balance sheets paint a much clearer picture of what\u2019s really happening. After digging through their reports, comments, and balance sheet movements, here are some high-level takeaways:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Record revenues</strong>: Banks posted record trading profits in the last quarter, fueled in part by bond trading. Goldman Sachs, for example, saw a\u00c2\u00a0<a data-saferedirecturl=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://go2.a16z.com/K0000JZ00ast1AB0000A0B0&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1596141638879000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGVD5OE6xrc6_8QyAzE9eZmes7hxg\" href=\"https://go2.a16z.com/K0000JZ00ast1AB0000A0B0\" id=\"m_3913379376828539387\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">93 percent</a>\u00c2\u00a0yearly increase in trading revenue and a\u00c2\u00a0<a data-saferedirecturl=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://go2.a16z.com/K0000JZ00ast1AB0000A0B0&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1596141638879000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGVD5OE6xrc6_8QyAzE9eZmes7hxg\" href=\"https://go2.a16z.com/K0000JZ00ast1AB0000A0B0\" id=\"m_3913379376828539387\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">150 percent</a>\u00c2\u00a0yearly increase in bond trading revenue. In part, that can be attributed to the large increase in debt offerings in recent months (over $5.1 billion in new debt offerings by businesses in the first half of the year). Citi, JP Morgan, and Bank of America also saw trading revenues surge. That continues to bolster their revenues, even as the reduction in the Federal funds rate means they cannot count on net interest income to contribute to their top line.</li>\n<li><strong>Preparing for the worst</strong>: Banks are increasing their provisions for bad loans on their balance sheets. These provisions are reserves against future write-offs, if and when consumers are unable to pay off their loans. Last quarter alone, for example, JP Morgan added an impressive $10.5 billion in provisions for bad debt. Combined with Citi and Bank of America\u00e2\u0080\u0099s provisions, that totals over\u00c2\u00a0<a data-saferedirecturl=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://go2.a16z.com/O0v0000B0100AJaK0U0B00Z&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1596141638879000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFXJc96CxehERPXdtpLpWohiHY8WQ\" href=\"https://go2.a16z.com/O0v0000B0100AJaK0U0B00Z\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">$28 billion</a>\u00c2\u00a0for future loan losses. On top of this, many banks are expecting double-digit unemployment for the rest of the year. Recent balance sheet movements indicate their desire to stay out ahead of further economic distress.</li>\n<li><strong>Consumers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 behavior is largely positive</strong>: Interestingly, many major banks have not yet seen a drastic change in consumers\u2019 ability to pay off their loans. JP Morgan\u00c2\u00a0<a data-saferedirecturl=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://go2.a16z.com/V0ZV000Bv00B100Ja000LA0&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1596141638879000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGI2MPuInLnQ_vNxF2rSkBEKyc2Fw\" href=\"https://go2.a16z.com/V0ZV000Bv00B100Ja000LA0\" id=\"m_3913379376828539387\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">reported</a>\u00c2\u00a0payment deferrals of 2.1 percent for consumer cards and 4 percent for business cards; 90 percent of those deferrals are for less than 30 days. All in all, net charge-offs at JP Morgan increased by 6 percent last quarter \u00e2\u0080\u0094 more than $1 billion short of expectations. One possible explanation is that expanded government programs and stimulus measures have helped keep consumers afloat. That bears the question: Will consumers plunge into debt if these programs dry up in the coming months?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>While the economic fallout of COVID-19 is yet to manifest in the stock market, banks are making significant moves to prepare for worsening conditions. The good news, if you can call it that, is most banks are better prepared than they were in 2008 \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and are guarding against an extended recession.</p>\n<p><i style=\"font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif\">\u00e2\u0080\u0094<a href=\"https://twitter.com/matt_haf\">Matthieu Hafemeister</a>, a16z fintech deal analyst</i></p>\n<hr/>\n<h3 id=\"fintech-meets-crypto\"><span style=\"color: #ff6600\"><strong>An emerging model for high-yield savings</strong></span></h3>\n<p>We called 2019 the <a data-saferedirecturl=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://go2.a16z.com/MA0B0000Jw00B00ea00Z031&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1596141638879000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGqjI3G7qH52RLZ7a3MqTwps58qNg\" href=\"https://go2.a16z.com/MA0B0000Jw00B00ea00Z031\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">year of high-yield savings accounts</a>, as companies including Betterment, Wealthfront, SoFi, Robinhood, and Credit Karma pursued prime customers.

As a result, consumer interest in these accounts dried up, creating a crunch for companies who target prime consumers. Despite this (or perhaps because of it) a new category of companies is emerging that delivers high yields via a different vehicle.</p>\n<p>Broadly speaking, fintechs have had difficulty attacking the prime market. Wealthfront and Robinhood have arguably achieved the most success by focusing on millennial savers and millennial (day) traders, but even these products are relatively small scale in comparison to Chime or Credit Karma. Discerning readers will rightfully point out that a small prime audience can be highly valuable. And given the intense competition among financial services providers to win the loyalty of the \u00e2\u0080\u009cfuture rich,\u00e2\u0080\u009d incumbents like Chase, Bank of America, and SVB already provide relatively robust experiences for prime customers.</p>\n<p>So what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a fintech founder to do? Companies like <a href=\"https://www.donut.app/\">Donut</a>, <a href=\"https://outlet.finance/\">Outlet</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.dharma.io/\">Dharma</a> are advancing a new model in which they provide &gt;2 percent yield on deposits by incorporating crypto securities lending. Specifically, users deposit USD to earn interest, just like a savings account. On the back end, those deposits are converted to cryptocurrencies, which are then loaned to hedge funds looking to leverage their trades. These hedge funds are willing to pay a high interest rate and typically overly capitalize the loan, thus mitigating loss risks. Though the yield is higher, the corresponding risk is higher, as well, since these accounts are not FDIC insured and depend on third party insurance to protect against theft or other losses.</p>\n<p>Though there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s regulatory uncertainty around this model, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s interesting on two levels. First, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an excellent example of the intersection of crypto and fintech, where crypto is an invisible enabler of a core consumer value proposition. Second, this model provides the potential for an emerging player to build a prime-focused offering that encompasses more complex sources of higher yield \u00e2\u0080\u0094 everything from securities lending to active trading strategies.

With a very thin file, a bank or lender often does not have enough credit history information to offer a loan. And as millennials increasingly prefer debit cards, they aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t building a credit history either. As a result, when it comes time to apply for a mortgage, credit card, or other personal or business loan, getting a low interest rate \u00e2\u0080\u0094 or getting approved at all \u00e2\u0080\u0094 is difficult.</p>\n<p>There are some existing options for building credit, such as credit builder loans and secured credit cards. While credit builder loans are not new products \u00e2\u0080\u0094 they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been offered by community banks and credit unions for years \u00e2\u0080\u0094 finding and qualifying for them is difficult and often has relied on having a personal relationship with the bank. With credit builder loans, consumers make monthly payments, which are typically held in an interest-bearing account by the bank. The bank reports the on-time payments to the credit bureaus, adding to the consumer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s positive repayment history on their credit file and boosting their credit score. (Repayment history comprises 35 percent of a consumer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s FICO score.) At the end of the term of the loan, the customer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s summed payments, plus interest, are returned to them. Alternatively,\u00c2\u00a0<a data-saferedirecturl=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://go2.a16z.com/K0000JZ00au81hB0000A0B0&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1596141638880000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGpN0mIj1pjSm66OFxe66EhQfdxXA\" href=\"https://go2.a16z.com/K0000JZ00au81hB0000A0B0\" id=\"m_3913379376828539387\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">secured credit cards</a>, like Chime\u00e2\u0080\u0099s offering, typically require a minimum deposit, which sets a spending limit (e.g. a $200 deposit allows you to spend $200). If the consumer doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t pay their bill, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s low risk for the card issuer: they can take the money from the consumer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s deposit and charge interest (the Chime card is 0% APY). These payments are also reported to the credit bureau, which helps the consumer build their credit file. Neither of these options, however, gives consumers guidance on how to\u00c2\u00a0<em>improve</em>\u00c2\u00a0their credit scores.</p>\n<p>A number of rent reporting companies like RentTrack, PayYourRent, and Pinch (acquired by Chime), enable consumers to report their on-time rental payments to the credit bureaus. More recently, companies like Self Financial and SeedFi \u00e2\u0080\u0094 as well as Chime\u00e2\u0080\u0099s card and Goldman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009cPath to Apple\u00e2\u0080\u009d advice \u00e2\u0080\u0094 have been focused on helping consumers build credit through loan repayments.</p>\n<p>Loan repayment history is more effective in improving access to credit than rental and utility payments. Why? Because credit is a measure of the consumer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s willingness to pay, not ability to pay. Paying rent and utilities doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t assess consumers\u2019 willingness to pay because they\u00c2\u00a0<em>have</em>\u00c2\u00a0to pay them to maintain housing. Thus, most traditional lenders don\u2019t give consumers as much credit for paying rent and utilities as they do for making more discretionary payments to cards and loans. Therefore, rent and utility payments are often not factored into underwriting models. So while newer FICO models do incorporate alternative data, like rental and utility data, into a consumer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s credit score, without improving a consumer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s access to credit, that alternative data is currently of limited use \u00e2\u0080\u0094 particularly since most lenders are still using an older, traditional FICO version. For now, credit builder loans often offer a better path to helping consumers achieve financial progress.</p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u00e2\u0080\u0094<a href=\"https://twitter.com/seema_amble\">Seema Amble</a>, a16z fintech deal partner</span></i></p>\n<hr/>\n<h3><span style=\"color: #ff6600\"><strong>More from the a16z fintech team</strong></span></h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://a16z.com/2020/06/16/pandemic-real-estate-part-1/?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=newsletter&amp;mkt_tok=eyJpIjoiTkRWa09HSTNNREU0WkdFMSIsInQiOiJYOUlxR2VJd0hOd1hiV0l2K0NcL0JIVGFyWHhtMHE2NFwvQmhGMERDM3ZjTnJtU0JMZlg3Q25zV0dqMjlpb1A0SmFPOEFIYUZvdUd5aFlFZEQ5UDFNS0x3PT0ifQ%3D%3D\">The a16z Podcast: Real Estate in a Pandemic</a><br/>\nHow has social distancing shaken up the market to buy?
